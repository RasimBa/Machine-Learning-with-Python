      "['2018-02-23', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'The persistence and signalling power of central bank asset purchase programmes', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2018 US Monetary Policy Forum, New York City, 23 February 2018', '  The persistence and signalling power of central bank asset purchase programmes   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2018 US Monetary Policy Forum, New York City, 23 February 2018 The financial crisis has seen central banks launch asset purchase programmes of unprecedented scope and scale, so as to provide additional policy stimulus as interest rates approached the lower bound. This period has yielded many insights into how these programmes work and their various channels of transmission.[1] But one question that has remained open is the relative importance of their “stock” and “flow” effects. The issue is not so much about which of the two effects dominates. The literature is fairly clear on this: there are sizeable announcement effects related to the stock of purchases, and these effects materialise whenever investors receive new information about the parameters of the purchase programme, such as its size, duration and composition. The actual impact of purchase operations on yields has been found to be less in comparison.[2]  The issue is rather if it matters how a given stock of purchases is built up, and how this building up interacts over time with the other elements of the monetary policy stance. This is especially important for the ECB today because, as we said in our latest introductory statements, our monetary support currently comprises three components: first, net asset purchases; second, the stock of acquired assets and forthcoming reinvestments; and third, our forward guidance on interest rates.  I would therefore like to use my remarks today to explore two aspects of implementing asset purchase programmes where I still see open questions. My focus will be on the closed economy dimension of such operations, having addressed their international spillovers elsewhere.[3]  The first aspect relates to the interaction between interest rate forward guidance and asset purchases. Specifically, for a given policy intention, are policymakers able to choose the relative intensity with which they use each of these instruments? In other words, under what conditions will they become substitutes rather than complements? The second aspect relates to the persistence of the effects of asset purchases. Does the stock effect appear mainly at the time of the announcement and then fade as new shocks occur? Or does it accumulate as the size of the central bank’s portfolio rises, meaning its effect can grow even as the flow of purchases is reduced? I intend to argue that, at least in the euro area, empirical evidence suggests that the amount of purchases needed to deliver a given compression of the term premium is likely to fall over time as the acquired stock of assets increases. But crucially, once their policy objectives come closer to being achieved, central banks can safeguard low bond yields, if judged necessary, only to the extent they provide effective guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates. Asset purchases and rate forward guidance Let me start with the interaction between rate forward guidance and asset purchases.  A natural starting point for such a discussion is to recall the two main components that shape long-term interest rates: expectations of future short-term rates and a term premium. Asset purchase programmes can lower yields by influencing both components. Purchases compress term premia by removing duration risk from the market. And since investors do not expect central banks to start raising rates while they are still buying assets, purchases – in principle – also have a signalling effect for the expected rate path.  I would argue, however, that the strength of this signalling effect is likely to depend on the degree of uncertainty that investors have about the policy outlook. When the outlook is gloomy and investors expect rates to remain low for long, they typically don’t focus on signals that will tie the hands of the central bank in the future. What they want to see is a clear commitment by the central bank to counter the downside risks that are visible now. They want them to “put their money where their mouth is”. But when policy has succeeded in shifting upwards the distribution of risks around the growth outlook, and expectations of an end to asset purchases start to mount, uncertainty about the future path of rates begins to increase. Then, the interaction between the horizon of the purchase programme and rate forward guidance becomes more important.  Let me illustrate this point by referring to our own experience of buying assets.  From the time we started purchasing assets in September 2014, to the time we expanded the programme to include public sector securities in March 2015, we observed a strong reaction in long-term yields as investors started to anticipate our future interventions. The ten-year Bund yield fell by nearly 80 basis points in that period alone. The launch of our asset purchase programme had undoubtedly erased concerns among market participants that the ECB might not be serious about achieving its price stability objective. We “put up”, in other words. But when, in December 2015, we extended the programme by six months and announced the reinvestment of future principal repayments, the reaction was much less favourable. Although the extension of the programme alone increased the expected stock of purchases by €360 billion, the ten-year Bund yield rose by 20 basis points upon announcement.  Clearly, market reactions were at odds with the standard thinking on the transmission of asset purchases. According to the signalling channel, our December 2015 actions should have helped to push out expectations of a rate lift-off. They should have provided strong forward guidance on the expected future path of short-term rates, thereby putting downward pressure on long-term rates. And the sizeable additional removal of bonds from the market should have weighed on term premia. None of this happened, however. As you can see on my first slide, the expected period of time until a rate lift-off in fact became shorter after our December 2015 announcement.    This suggests two things. First, it cannot be excluded that markets may have taken our backloaded actions – the extension pertained to a period that would only start nine months from the announcement date, while future reinvestments under the public sector purchase programme would not start until 15 months later – as a sign of hesitation on the part of the Governing Council to follow through on our commitment to bring inflation back to our aim. In the eyes of investors, we failed to “put up”.  This in turn implies, and this is my second point, that when markets perceive a central bank’s inflation aim to be at risk, asset purchases are a commitment device that reassures investors that the central bank is unwilling to tolerate a protracted period of low inflation, on top of their direct impact on financial conditions.  As such, the signal they send about the future path of short-term rates is of a secondary nature. Purchase pace and envelope are what matter most. This is also consistent with findings in the literature which show that the signalling effect of asset purchases is typically moderate at the time they are announced.[4]  However, we have also seen that, as the outlook improves, the signal that asset purchases send regarding the likely date of a first rate hike becomes increasingly important for anchoring the medium to long-term segment of the curve.  This can also be seen in the greater sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news, as my next slide shows. As expectations of an end to asset purchases build up in the market, expected short-term rates in one year’s time have become increasingly more responsive to changes in the data.    At this point, the close relationship between expectations of a rate lift-off and the purchase horizon opens room for the central bank to recalibrate the relative intensity of the instruments it uses to secure appropriate financial conditions. For example, a shorter purchase horizon could be combined with stronger rate forward guidance so as to mitigate the risk of investors unduly bringing forward their rate expectations.  The terms of this recalibration will largely depend on three considerations.  The first relates to financial stability considerations – that is, the potential side effects of central banks being active players in bond markets for a protracted period of time. Should too long a presence unduly affect market liquidity or market structures, then this could tilt the balance away from purchases and towards stronger guidance on rates.  Of course, low-for-long short-term interest rates also have financial stability implications. But this is not the point. The point is that asset purchases are necessary at the lower bound to reinforce forward guidance, but this necessity gradually declines as the outlook improves. The second consideration relates to clarity on communication, in particular when guidance on rates is linked to the end date of the asset purchase programme. In the ECB’s case, we have stated that we expect rates to remain at their present levels “well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”.  This has proved a powerful way to dispel concerns about expectations of a premature tightening as we gradually succeeded in shifting upwards the distribution of risks around the inflation outlook. You can see this clearly on my previous slide. After we introduced the notion of “well past” in March 2016, and increased the pace of purchases, the expected time to a lift-off was pushed out measurably.  But as a central bank gets closer to reaching its inflation aim, risks become larger that uncertainty around the horizon of purchases may inject volatility into the expected future rate path, even well ahead of the signalled purchasing intentions of the central bank.  This might not only affect financial conditions, but also blur the signals central banks rely on to gauge market expectations. For example, over the course of the last two months we saw a repricing in the EONIA forward curve. But it is difficult to tell with certainty whether this was the result of a re-appraisal by markets of the meaning of “well past” in our forward guidance – that is, a genuine adjustment of interest rate expectations – or merely a reflection of changes to the expected length of our asset purchase programme.  More clarity on future rates could then in principle help condense the focus of market uncertainty from two variables – the end-date of asset purchases and the definition of “well past” – to one variable, which the central bank can control with its communication.  This is in fact very similar to what my colleague Peter Praet had said recently, namely that “as we progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation and approach the time when net purchases will gradually come to an end, the residual monetary support needed to assist the economy in its transition to a new normal will increasingly come from forward guidance on our policy rates.”[5]  Importantly, this is not about the sequence of instrument normalisation. In the ECB’s case, the Governing Council has confirmed it repeatedly. It is rather about the ability of the central bank to effectively steer market conditions in a way consistent with its price stability mandate.  But whether it would in fact achieve this depends in part on the third consideration, namely the strength of the “stock effect” – that is, the persistence of the effects of the stock of bonds held by the central bank on its balance sheet under a commitment of reinvestment.[6]  If the effects of purchases dissipate quickly, a shorter purchase horizon could lead to term premia rising even as interest rate expectations remain well anchored by forward guidance. Financial conditions would then tighten.  But if the effectiveness of asset purchases rises with the stock of assets already acquired – if there is some “crossover point” where the stock effect becomes more important than the continued flow of purchases – then a reduced pace of purchases would not unduly decompress the term premium. This brings me to my second question, which concerns the persistence of asset purchase programmes.  The persistence of asset purchase programmes: theory Unfortunately, surprisingly little is known about this issue in the academic literature, mainly due to the preponderance of event studies in existing research.[7] Those studies have little to say about the persistence of asset purchase programmes long after they are announced. Other studies using time-series analysis suggest that the expected persistence of the supply shock is important.[8]  What I would like to offer today is a way of thinking about it which, I believe, could shed some light on how the stock effect of purchases works in practice, how it evolves over time and why it might differ between jurisdictions.  I will look at some of the empirical evidence in a minute, but I would first like to structure my thoughts with the help of a simple stylised supply and demand diagram like the one you can see here on the left-hand side of my next slide. This is an easy way to visualise the interaction between a central bank acting as a buyer of securities and potential sellers in the secondary market.    For ease of illustration, the demand curve of the central bank is vertical – that is, the central bank’s demand can be expected to be price-inelastic, by and large. Our objective is not to minimise costs or to maximise profits: it is to create the financial conditions required to achieve price stability. This is without prejudice, of course, to our legal requirement to act in accordance with the principles of an open market economy in which prices are discovered through private supply and demand.[9]  The supply curve, by contrast, is unlikely to be just a linear upward-sloping curve. It is likely to be a convex function. Let me explain why. As demand rises, supply is likely to become increasingly constrained. Inventory holdings by intermediaries shrink, while other marginal sellers are likely to have a higher reservation price.  For example, pension funds typically need to invest a significant portion of their assets in safe long-dated bonds to match their liabilities. Many other market participants need to keep high quality liquid assets for regulatory reasons. These investors will typically sell only for a higher premium. It is now easy to see that the effectiveness of purchases can be expected to increase over time. A given outward shift of our demand curve, through, say, an extension of our asset purchase programme, will meet a supply curve that gets steeper as bonds become scarcer. The “bang for the buck” rises.[10]  On the right-hand side you can see how this translates into the stock effect.  Central bank asset purchase programmes effectively constrain the supply of bonds available to private price-sensitive investors. So you can think of it as an inward shift of the supply curve. However, the demand curve for private investors, unlike that for central banks, is unlikely to be price-inelastic. It is pictured here as a standard downward-sloping linear demand curve. The implication is that if central banks have succeeded in shifting the supply curve sufficiently inwards, then prices may become less sensitive even when purchases start being reduced. Consider the example of an adverse demand shock, shown on the right-hand side – that is, investors will want to sell bonds as the economic outlook improves and expectations of higher rates mount.  You can see that the price impact of such a change in demand is likely to be more contained than in a situation where supply is greater. The reason is that any new supply would be absorbed with smaller price changes, given the scarcity of the underlying asset. The persistence of asset purchase programmes: evidence Both of these stylised representations are supported by the data.  On my next slide you can see that, as our purchase programme has progressed, we have indeed seen a shift towards investors with a higher reservation price as marginal seller to the Eurosystem. We are now increasingly purchasing assets from pension funds and insurance companies rather than from non-residents, who are less likely to have a statutory need for euro area government bonds. The implication is that our purchases are likely to have become more effective over time.    On the next slide you can see how the cumulative effect of these purchases on private bond supply has created the conditions for strong stock effects. What you can see here is an estimate of the share of outstanding central government bonds held by the private sector – the so-called “free float” – for three euro area countries that investors consider safe.  The free float is constructed by computing the fraction of outstanding bonds that is held neither by the Eurosystem under the public sector purchase programme nor by foreign central banks as part of their foreign exchange reserves. In each case the free float has shrunk significantly since our asset purchase programme began. This is especially the case for German Bunds, which is of particular importance for the euro area as Bund prices effectively determine the quasi-risk free curve in the euro area. According to our estimates, less than 10% of the outstanding stock of German Bunds might currently be in the hands of private investors. But this estimate needs to be treated with caution as it relies on a number of assumptions regarding the allocation of overseas foreign exchange reserves.  As my next slide shows, the drop in the free float has had a significant impact on price dynamics. What you can see here is the empirical relationship between the Bund free-float and the term premium investors require for holding long-term Bunds. We exclude here the period around the financial and sovereign debt crises.[11]     Two things stand out. First, there is a clear positive relationship between the amount of duration risk private investors are expected to hold and the compensation they require for holding it. Second, it is easy to see that the relationship is non-linear and that the term premium has become less responsive at lower free float levels. This is the stock effect at work.  The amount of bonds available to private investors is currently so low that investors are willing to absorb new bonds without requiring much higher compensation. Supply is effectively constraining demand. This becomes clear if we recall the statutory needs of many investors for safe and liquid assets. In these circumstances, only very large changes in the expected supply of bonds can cause yields to rise more meaningfully.  This framework helps us explain why, in the course of the last year, Bund yields traded in a tight corridor despite the measurable decline in our purchase pace from €80 billion per month in March 2017 to €30 billion as of January this year.  Of course, stock effects have not prevented Bund prices from falling in line with the strong economic recovery: an improving outlook will naturally drive yields higher as expectations of the future rate path are revised. But what stock effects have achieved is to temper the impact of both domestic demand shocks and foreign spillovers on euro area term premia. In some ways, there are parallels with the discussion of nonlinearities in the Phillips curve: here too we see evidence that price increases only start to accelerate more forcefully once the economy moves into the steeper part of the curve. Unlike in the labour market, however, current and future reinvestments of principal repayments on our asset purchases should ensure that expected supply in the Bund market remains below the threshold at which price effects may increase in strength. Squaring the stock effect in the United States and the euro area  Another way of demonstrating the non-linear nature of stock effects is to consider the very different market reaction we saw here in the United States as expectations of an end to asset purchases mounted, in particular the famous “taper tantrum” in mid-2013. Indeed, one argument put forward by those who are sceptical of the persistence of stock effects is that the announcement of tapering led to an immediate repricing of the market for US Treasuries. As you can see on my next slide, this cannot systematically be explained by an upward revision in interest rate expectations. Expected rates jumped twice but came back.    Rather, the repricing was driven by a steep and lasting increase in the term premium on ten-year US Treasuries – by more than 130 basis points in less than three months, as you can see on the right-hand side. This is hard to square with persistent term premium effects of central bank asset purchase programmes. Yet, we have to remember that, even after various rounds of quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve held only around 20% of outstanding marketable US debt at the time. Even when accounting for the holdings of other price-insensitive investors, such as foreign central banks, private investors still held around half of marketable US Treasuries. Remember that it may be less than 10% in the case of German Bunds. In part, this reflects the fiscal environment prevailing at the time the asset purchases were taking place. Demand on the part of the Federal Reserve has consistently been lower than net new issuance. This means that private sector holdings of government bonds continued to grow while the Federal Reserve’s purchase programmes were in place, albeit at a slower pace than would otherwise have been the case. In the euro area, by contrast, purchases by the Eurosystem were significantly larger than new net issuance, producing a cumulative contraction in the share of privately held bonds.  In other words, US Treasuries around the taper tantrum episode were likely still in sufficient supply to satisfy the demand of private investors, which made bond prices more sensitive. Indeed, on my next slide you can see the same relationship I just showed for the Bund for US Treasuries – that is, the ten-year Treasury term premium against the free float. These are the black dots.    You can see clearly that the United States was always in a steeper part of the curve, where supply was unable to anchor term premia. You can also see that at these levels of the free float, the relation between term premia and free float was not much different in the Bund market – you can see this when looking at the red dots. On my next slide you can see how this might have affected market reactions in periods when the outlook had started to brighten. Here I show cumulative changes of a model-based shock decomposition of long-term yields, starting in May 2013 for the United States and in May 2017 for the euro area.    You can see that while in the United States a combination of macroeconomic, policy and foreign shocks were driving yields higher, in the euro area domestic shocks were appreciably more moderate, and foreign shocks were even putting downward pressure on yields. This happened despite a broadly comparable economic backdrop. Stock effects might therefore have helped to insulate the euro area from foreign spillovers and to temper domestic shocks.  Bond yield developments relative to the overnight index swap (OIS) curve corroborate this view.  You can see from the left-hand side of the next slide that in the euro area, at both two-year and ten-year durations, the spread between German Bunds and corresponding OIS rates turned negative as we started implementing the asset purchase programme and consistently and gradually widened over time as the implementation of our asset purchases proceeded. This is a crude but reliable gauge of the effect of stocks on the term premium.    The reason is that, if changes in the Bund term premium were being driven by risk factors alone – say, higher inflation expectations or uncertainty about monetary policy – we would expect the Bund-OIS spread to be fairly constant. Such factors typically affect both markets as swap dealers use positions in Bunds to hedge interest rate risk on swaps. But the fact that the spread is widening over time suggests that it is not being driven by common factors, but rather by factors specific to the Bund market. The most plausible candidate for a secular effect of this kind is supply-demand effects induced by a shrinking free float.[12]  In the United States, by contrast, as you can see on the right-hand side, the ten-year spread was negative at various points during the three quantitative easing programmes, but there was no persistent widening as we have seen in the euro area, suggesting a role for factors other than bond scarcity caused by central bank interventions.  Conclusion So what are the implications of all this for future monetary policy?  The non-linear nature of the stock effect implies that the amount of purchases needed to deliver a given compression of the term premium is likely to fall over time as the acquired stock of assets increases. Once the “crossover point” has been passed, additional purchases become less necessary to contain the term premium at low levels.  With the current share of the Bund free float constituting only a small fraction of the total outstanding, we can be confident that we have passed this threshold in the euro area, in particular as current and future reinvestments will ensure that the amount of duration risk to be borne by price-sensitive private investors will increase only very moderately over time. This means that, in the future, the Eurosystem can retreat as buyer in the market without risking an unwarranted decompression of the term premium. But it can contain volatility, and safeguard appropriate financial conditions, only to the extent that it provides effective guidance on the expected future path of short-term interest rates.

The regulatory technical standards (RTS) on strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication, which have been submitted by the European Commission to the co-legislators for scrutiny, strike a fair balance between the previously diverging views of the different players. They should soon be finalised and then published in the Official Journal. The new legislative framework will support innovation and competition in retail payments; it will enhance the security of payment transactions and the protection of consumer data. It will introduce major changes to which all payment service providers (PSPs) will have to adapt, and I encourage all PSPs to ensure the highest level of security in their payment services and adopt the requirements of the RTS ahead of time. Banks should also grasp the opportunity to work towards a single and standardised interface to communicate with third-party providers (TPPs) across Europe in a safe and efficient manner. Cooperation with TPPs and users is crucial in this context in order to deliver innovative, efficient and competitive services to the people of Europe.  Let me explain this in more detail. Security requirements during the transition period As co-chair of the European Forum on the Security of Retail Payments (SecuRe Pay), the ECB has contributed in particular to the RTS in respect of strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication, the Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks of payment services and the Guidelines on major incident reporting. It is still involved in the finalisation of the Guidelines on fraud data reporting requirements.  Now that Member States have transposed or are about to transpose the PSD2 and almost all pieces of secondary legislation have been finalised, I think we can say that the European market has taken a major step towards:   increasing the protection of payment service users against fraud and possible abuses of their financial information,  fostering the resilience of PSPs through harmonised minimum security requirements, and towards enabling competition in the field of payment services by introducing innovative payment services such as payment initiation services, account information services and issuing card-based payment instruments where a confirmation on the availability of funds is requested, as well as clarifying the applicable liability regime for such services.  I am aware that the market still has some concerns and that clarifications with respect to the PSD2, and the RTS in particular, have been requested. The ECB will continue to provide support and expertise in this field as an active observer in the API Evaluation Group, which was recently established by the European Commission.  Beyond this, I am convinced that it is in your particular interest as payment service providers – and in the interest of the security of the retail payments market more generally – to implement the RTS and other related PSD2 requirements as soon as possible. Please do not wait 18 months until you are obliged to comply with the security requirements enshrined in the RTS. Take action soon, as these measures are necessary to mitigate threat scenarios of which you are well aware. For example, strong customer authentication solutions with dynamic linking of the authorisation to the specific amount and payee will help to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Transaction and device monitoring is essential to identify unusual payment patterns and potential fraud cases. It is also essential to start offering well-functioning and reliable access interfaces to the payment service user accounts in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your customer information.  It is also paramount that TPPs be authorised or registered as soon as possible, and comply with all legal requirements at an early stage. TPPs need to bear their share of the responsibility by testing and using the access interfaces in a prompt and cooperative fashion, and by contributing constructively to the ongoing efforts aimed at the standardisation of these interfaces.  Standardisation Standardisation is a basis for the efficient and pan-European provision of payment services in an integrated market. Already shortly after the adoption of PSD2, members of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) voiced concern that the legal requirements alone would not be sufficient for the provisioning of efficient and integrated pan-European payment initiation services (PIS) and that the industry should agree on common technical, operational and business requirements to complement the legal requirements.  “Business” in this sense means, for instance, the processes for incident handling between PSPs but excludes commercial aspects. “Operational” refers to matters such as a directory service that banks could address 24/7 to check whether a TPP contacting them is indeed still a licensed PSP. “Technical” relates mainly to the interfaces that banks are obliged to offer according to the PSD2 and the RTS. The PSD2 and the RTS do not provide technical specifications; they only set high-level requirements. In order to remain technologically neutral, and to cater for potentially different approaches by PSPs, the RTS give the account-servicing PSP the choice of establishing an interface dedicated to payment initiation services or allowing TPPs the use of the online banking interface used by their normal customers.  As a consequence, the approximately 4,000 banks offering SEPA credit transfer could in theory finally try to meet the legal requirements of PSD2 and its RTS by developing and offering a proprietary interface. Thus, in a worst-case scenario, any TPP would need to manage 4,000 bespoke IT-projects to connect to each of those banks, thereby clearly going against the spirit of the new directive.  Back in February 2014 in the ECB’s legal opinion on the proposed PSD2, we pointed out the importance of working towards a standardised European interface to facilitate pan-European PIS. The European Commission has also clearly articulated recently that a standardised interface is their preference, since it provides the technical basis for competition and allows even the smallest players, including start-ups (fintechs), to enter the market with new and innovative services that could be offered with a pan-European reach. It is a step in the right direction that only a few initiatives are currently developing standardised specifications for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the ERPB already called for close cooperation between these projects. I would even go a step further and encourage these initiatives to join forces and agree on one common technical specification so that the whole of Europe could base their systems upon one or a few technical API standards. This will greatly facilitate market entry, avoid fragmentation and allow for competition at the service level, avoiding obstacles at the technical level.  To promote the uptake of standardised APIs, the European Commission has invited market participants to establish an API Evaluation Group, which has just started its work. I call on the banks to actively, substantively and speedily contribute to the activities of this Group, as its findings are essential for the competent authorities, after consulting the EBA, to grant an exemption from the RTS obligation to offer a fallback solution for the dedicated interface. I am of course aware that a bank can also be compliant with the RTS by offering an adaptation of its customer online banking interface instead of a dedicated interface. Such interfaces would meet the legal requirements, but would not meet the market needs of efficient and pan-European provision of payment initiation services. So I was disappointed when I heard that some banks seem to be seriously considering this option. I strongly encourage them to offer a dedicated interface, based on a standardised specification, as this is one pillar of successful PIS.  Last, but certainly not least, the ERPB extended the mandate of its Working Group on payment initiation services to follow up several common requirements related to operational and business elements, which together are the other pillar of successful PIS. I appreciate the commitment that the banks have shown to this important task and expect to complete the work by June 2018. It is important that the API Evaluation Group and the ERPB Working Group progress in parallel so that PSPs have clarity by the summer and can plan their investments that need to be made. Then they can prepare for a timely implementation of PSD2 and the RTS and be ready for the competition that PSD2 aims to foster.  Conclusion To conclude, I would strongly encourage European payment service providers to embrace the opportunities the PSD2 provides for competition and innovation, to cooperate in the standardisation of APIs that should preferably result in a single API, and to implement all the security requirements of the new directive and its RTS as soon as possible, even before they become mandatory.  I count on the full commitment of the European Banking Federation and the entire payments industry to work towards safe, efficient and innovative payment services.    ']\n",

I would like to take this opportunity to discuss an issue which I believe is key for the economic future of Europe and particularly relevant here, in the Western Balkans: the prospects for trade as an engine of growth. For several years now, global trade growth has puzzled many observers. While global trade grew at about twice the rate of GDP before the crisis, it has slowed measurably since then and has often grown at the same rate as, or even below, that of global output. However, in 2017, world import growth once again outpaced world GDP growth. The euro area is benefiting from this recovery, with export growth the highest in many years. In my remarks this morning, I will argue that the rebound in trade mainly reflects cyclical factors. Accommodative monetary policies worldwide have succeeded in boosting growth and investment and, with them, global imports. Structural headwinds remain, however. Maturing global value chains, geographical shifts in trade and an accelerating push towards more automation make it less likely that trade can again expand at the pace observed during the pre-crisis boom.  To the extent that trade helps lift growth, policymakers have a role to play in providing an environment that is conducive to trade. At the same time, they need to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to support workers affected by secular shifts in both trade flows and labour demand. Rebound in world trade Let me start with a few facts and charts. Last year, global imports expanded by 5%, the strongest growth in seven years. On the left-hand side of my first slide you can see that the rebound in global trade was broad-based, with both emerging and advanced economies contributing in roughly equal proportions. On the right-hand side you can see that this by and large reflects the fast broadening of the global economic expansion. At the end of last year, 75% of the economies worldwide experienced growth above their three-year averages. In 2016, this share was below 30%. So, the global economy is in a much more robust state today than it was just a few years ago.  The breakdown of extra-euro area exports also shows that the current synchronous expansion is fertile ground for a strong rebound in trade. You can see this on the left-hand side of my next slide. By the end of last year, euro area exporters had expanded their business with virtually all of our main trading partners.  Growing demand from China, and emerging Asia more generally, as well as recovering demand from commodity exporters are once more contributing to, rather than subtracting from, export growth. One exception to this benign picture is the United Kingdom, where Brexit repercussions might already be showing through in the data. Trade has also gained momentum within the euro area. You can see this on the right-hand side. Although intra-euro area export growth is currently somewhat weaker than extra-area growth, we can see that exports are today contributing more evenly to growth across euro area countries. It is no longer only a few Member States that are benefitting from a booming global economy.  In particular, structural reforms and internal devaluation in formerly stressed economies, together with a protracted period of weak domestic demand during the crisis years, have prompted more firms in these economies to improve their competitiveness and thereby profit from a rise in foreign demand, both inside and outside the currency union.  This is perhaps best illustrated by the share of exports in GDP on the left-hand side of my next slide. Last year, compared with the period 2000 to 2007, this share rose strongly in Ireland and Slovenia, while Portugal, Greece and Cyprus also managed double-digit gains. This supported the economic recovery and helped to reduce unemployment.  A natural side effect of these changes was a notable widening of the euro area’s current account surplus. You can see this on the right-hand side. Almost all Member States that entered the financial crisis with large current account deficits are today reporting current account surpluses. Of the euro area’s 19 Member States, 13 have current account surpluses.  But the chart also illustrates clearly that the rebalancing has remained limited to formerly stressed economies. Up until recently, current account surpluses have continued to rise in Germany and in the Netherlands, the two export powerhouses in the euro area. While these surpluses undoubtedly reflect strong underlying fundamentals in terms of competitiveness, they also reflect an imbalance between domestic savings and investment. Higher domestic investment would therefore be a constructive way to address large current account surpluses and, at the same time, to prepare for future challenges.  Now, does the current trade recovery bode well for the future? What are the prospects for global and euro area trade? Will we return to an environment where trade growth persistently outpaces GDP growth? In answering these questions, I will distinguish between cyclical and structural factors. Cyclical factors affecting trade growth As for the cyclical factors, empirical evidence suggests that economic growth alone is often not a sufficient condition for strong trade growth. Indeed, trade did not start to lift off before we saw a nascent recovery in global investment, which had weakened significantly after the Great Recession.  On my next slide you can see that in advanced economies the share of public and private investment in output declined sharply with the advent of the crisis and has remained well below pre-crisis levels since then. For emerging markets, the investment share had been rising but it has plateaued in recent years.  So, the composition of growth matters for trade. Investment in particular has a relatively high import intensity.[2] As a result, a slowdown in investment demand typically has a disproportionately large adverse impact on trade, relative to other GDP components. It is therefore no coincidence that the recovery in trade last year was led by exports of capital goods and intermediate goods, both key inputs to investment. You can see this clearly in the case of the euro area on the right-hand side. The implication is that future trade growth will depend to some extent on the sustainability of the current investment recovery. For sure, continued accommodative financial conditions and business optimism will continue to support investment and hence trade. The United States has also just lowered its taxation of capital, which can be expected to further boost growth in capital formation. In the euro area, investment is expected to remain robust due to rising corporate profits, high levels of expected earnings, and an increasing need to modernise the capital stock. Indeed, according to Eurosystem staff projections, investment in the euro area is expected to increase by just over 10% until the end of 2020.[3]  So, overall, we can be confident that investment growth, and the current broad-based economic expansion more generally, will continue to support international trade in the coming years. Structural factors affecting trade growth Yet, while the cyclical pick-up in trade remains supportive, structural headwinds may prevent rates of trade growth returning to the levels we observed in the two decades prior to the crisis. In short, empirical evidence suggests that the factors that have supported extraordinary trade growth rates in the past were special and are likely, by and large, to have run their course.[4]  For example, rapid financial deepening in emerging economies, and better access to capital markets, has helped boost trade growth in the past. But research suggests that there are likely diminishing marginal effects of finance on trade growth.[5] In other words, there appears to be a threshold – when private sector credit reaches around 100% of GDP – beyond which financial deepening no longer contributes meaningfully to trade growth.  But by far the strongest factor behind the boost in trade growth prior to the crisis, but which now appears to be waning, is the international outsourcing of production processes via so-called global value chains.  I would like to focus on this factor in the remainder of my remarks. Global value chains involve production processes being split into a number of intermediate steps, mainly in order to exploit international factor income differences. As a result, production has become dispersed across countries, and mechanically increased the amount of trade that took place for a given final output. You can see this clearly on my next slide. In the past, we have seen a close relationship between global value chain growth and the share of imports in total output. The global integration of China, for example, not only increased its exports to developed economies, but it also increased its imports of raw materials and intermediate goods from neighbouring emerging economies. This boosted overall world trade relative to output.  However, as you can see on the same slide, since the crisis we have seen a levelling-off of participation rates in global value chains. In other words, the share of global value chain related exports and imports in total trade has stabilised. This means that the support for world trade from global value chains has recently faded.  The important question to ask then is whether this levelling-off will be temporary or more permanent. In the view of ECB researchers, there are at least three factors that suggest that the slowdown in global value chain formation is likely to persist, at least in the short term.  The first factor relates to supply-chain risks.  You will recall that the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused severe supply disruptions. Some companies discovered, the hard way, that supply chains were not transparent, rather like the fault lines in securitisation that caused the great financial crisis. In short, suppliers hired sub-contractors, who themselves hired sub-contractors, and so on. As a result, an OECD report suggests that supply chains are increasingly designed to contain risks as well as costs.[6] Often, this implies shorter and more transparent value chains. And given the intimate relation between digitalisation and trade, this trend could be amplified further in the future by rising cyber risk and risks to data integrity. The second factor relates to shifts in comparative advantages.  In the past, wage differentials for unskilled labour made the international fragmentation of production processes worthwhile. Some of those wage differentials are now less marked as emerging economies continue to develop. In China, for example, real wages have increased by a factor of ten since 1995.  The implications for trade are twofold. First, as the Chinese and other emerging market economies mature and incomes grow, there is a rising shift from investment to consumption. This results in a lower trade intensity of demand. We already see that Chinese import growth has slowed markedly.  The second implication is that outsourcing of production processes has become less profitable. In the short term, this is unlikely to unravel existing value chains that also benefit from important supplier network effects – that is, from local upstream and downstream inputs and services. But in the long run it might lead to businesses reconsidering their offshoring practices. This brings me to my third point.  Shifts in comparative advantage could simply mean that other, less developed economies will take over from the more mature economies at the lower end of global value chains, following the traditional “flying geese” pattern. Like nomads, firms move on and global value chains move with them. Lumpy technological change could even help some of these economies leapfrog and jump directly to the most advanced stage of technology – the so-called “advantage of backwardness”.[7]  I would like to suggest, however, that the fourth industrial revolution – and the associated increase in automation and the use of artificial intelligence – may mark a move away from this model. The reason is that the increased use of robots has the potential to modify the relative factor intensities in the production of certain goods and services and may thereby sever the link between, say, cheap labour and the location of unskilled manufacturing activities.[8] Put simply, if robots can deliver the same output more cheaply, more efficiently and closer to the consumer, then firms may have fewer reasons to spread production across countries.[9]  In other words, robots could turn global value chains on their head and cause firms to reconsider offshoring practices. A survey by the Boston Consulting Group, for example, revealed that more than 70% of senior manufacturing executives in the United States consider that robotics improve the economics of local production.[10]  Lower automation costs are a key ingredient of this rethinking. Indeed, while the cost of labour is rising in traditional low-cost developing economies, the cost of robots has fallen sharply. By some estimates, the average price of industrial robots has declined by about 40% over the past ten years and is projected to decline considerably further.[11]  And the potential for automation is enormous. A recent McKinsey report suggests that 60% of global manufacturing activities, and 81% of manufacturing hours, could be automated using existing technology.[12] This is not just a topic for the future. We are already seeing clear signs of accelerating automation.  According to data from the International Federation of Robotics, the global supply of industrial robots grew by 19% on average between 2009 and 2016. It is forecast to increase further by almost 80% by 2020, bringing the total stock of robots to around three million.  Of course, technological progress also changed the way we produced goods and services in the past. But because the current breakthroughs – just think of 3D printers, autonomous vehicles or cognitive computing – are virtually unprecedented in scope and scale, the “march of the machines” may potentially render a significant share of the international fragmentation of trade redundant, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  The rise of automation may therefore accelerate a process that Dani Rodrik termed “premature deindustrialisation” in developing economies.[13] This term describes a pattern whereby developing economies see their manufacturing base shrink at a level of income that is far below the level attained by advanced economies before they started to deindustrialise.  This means two things. First, the impact of reshoring and the automation of unskilled manufacturing processes on developing countries’ labour markets could be significant. The International Labour Organization recently estimated that around two-thirds of jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Indonesia are at risk of automation.[14] For Cambodia, the figure is 90%. Second, automation may become a headwind to the catching-up process of developing countries. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has tended to converge to the global frontier more easily than that in other sectors. Manufacturing was thus traditionally a sector that allowed developing economies to catch up with advanced economies. China is certainly a case in point. But to the extent that automation accelerates the decline in manufacturing, it may force countries to consider the development of other growth models.  None of this is to say that technological progress is bad and should be stopped. On the contrary, if managed wisely, the fourth industrial revolution has the potential to lift global income levels and to improve the quality of our lives. After all, technological progress remains the engine of both growth and aggregate employment, although often in an increasingly disruptive way.  Historical evidence provides some cause for optimism. A recent study on German manufacturing, for example, finds that automation accounts for around a quarter of the manufacturing jobs lost between 1994 and 2014.[15] But these jobs were fully offset by higher employment in the services sector. Moreover, manufacturing workers in positions with greater exposure to robots were more likely to stay at their current workplace, although not necessarily in the same job and usually at the cost of lower wages.  Such compositional changes have taken place in the past too. For instance, the share of US employment in agriculture fell by 56 percentage points between 1850 and 2015. New technologies may bring new opportunities too. The McKinsey report I mentioned estimates that by 2030, around 10% of labour demand will be for positions that barely exist today, for example AI specialists and big data analysts.[16]  This transition is unlikely to be swift or easy, however. History also provides many examples of how changes in relative sectoral demand can create large and long-lasting divergences in labour market outcomes. The European Union is a case in point. There are regions where high rates of unemployment have persisted for decades following the decline of employment in certain industries, such as coal mining and steel production.  In the end, the transition will be governed by the extent to which employment creation in new sectors keeps pace with the automation of jobs in existing sectors. And it will depend on the ability of workers to acquire new skills, and potentially to relocate geographically, so that they can transfer between sectors – and on how they can be empowered to do so. Policy implications and conclusions With this in mind, let me conclude with some policy implications. The first is that automation implies that protectionist policies aimed at preventing – and reversing – job losses among low-skilled workers in manufacturing are unlikely to achieve their aim.  This is because reshoring, forced or not, is ultimately the outcome of regained competitiveness and changes in relative factor intensities. Production then becomes more capital and skill-intensive and is unlikely to create many new jobs for low-skilled workers. Higher tariffs are also less effective than they were in the past, given that intra-firm trade has grown substantially. As a result, higher tariffs may well reduce domestic profitability.  In other words, policymakers need to adapt to the changing nature of global trade. As Richard Baldwin points out in his recent book, the focus on the flow of goods between countries is misplaced. The current round of globalisation relies on the flow of know-how across borders.[17] As such, whereas previous industrial revolutions tended to affect mainly low-skilled workers, the current information revolution makes even mid-skilled jobs insecure. The second implication is that policymakers need to help new industries to grow and develop. This is particularly important for services, which already account for two-thirds of global GDP and employment, and represent many of the potential growth sectors in the age of digitalisation and automation. Research by the ESCB’s CompNet research network shows, for example, that many EU services sector firms are far behind the productivity frontier.[18] Reallocating capital and labour towards more productive firms would help boost overall competitiveness and support employment. For the EU, this means completing the Single Market for services. The same CompNet research points to the potential benefits of increased trade in services. Firms that have just started to export are, on average, about 15% more productive, 30% larger and pay 10% higher wages than non-exporting firms in the same narrowly defined sector. Not only are exporting firms more productive at the outset, they increase their productivity in their first year of exporting by more than comparable non-exporting firms.[19]  But policy actions must go beyond trade initiatives. In Europe, we need comprehensive policy action, at both EU and national level, to support workers who have lost their jobs due to technological shifts and facilitate employment in emerging industries. Certainly, this involves ensuring adequate education and retraining programmes to help smooth the transition to new employment. But it also means continuing to address structural rigidities in labour markets that may prolong and amplify secular shifts in labour demand. This includes fostering labour mobility across EU countries. Freedom of movement of workers is undoubtedly an engine of growth. But we should also be realistic. Not everyone will benefit from the technological changes, and new solutions are needed to address these challenges. Continued high structural unemployment in some European countries shows that this is an area where policymakers have not been successful in the past.  The third implication is that the challenges of automation go far beyond employment. History corroborates this view. Technological progress in the early part of the 19th century was accompanied by a long period of stagnation in real wages, even though output per worker increased sharply.[20] The late 19th century also witnessed a prolonged period of deflation brought about by technological improvement that was unpopular at the time, even though it was accompanied by strong output growth.[21]  The Western Balkan economies share many of the opportunities and challenges that I have discussed. Lower GDP per capita raises the opportunity to leapfrog and jump directly to the digital economy, as well as the risk of being hurt by reshoring and premature deindustrialisation. Trade openness in the region remains below that of other comparable economies in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe. This may in part reflect institutional factors, such as the effectiveness of the judiciary system or infrastructure development needs, but may also reflect competitiveness bottlenecks, including of the type I mentioned earlier. Addressing these bottlenecks at a national and at a regional level will foster trade, improve access to new, larger markets and, ultimately, accelerate convergence and income growth in the region.

Apply it in the right way, and you always arrive at a consistent conclusion. But apply it in the wrong way, and it can lead you astray. And that happens all too easily. There are indeed many wrong ways in which we can apply logic. One of them is known as the fallacy of composition. It refers to the idea that the whole always equals the sum of its parts. Well, that idea is wrong. As we all know, the whole can be more than the sum of its parts – or less. Consider this statement: if each bank is safe and sound, the banking system must be safe and sound as well. By now, we have learnt the hard way that this might indeed be a fallacy of composition. Let me give you just one example. Imagine that a certain asset suddenly becomes more risky. Each bank that holds this asset might react prudently by selling it. However, if many banks react that way, they will drive down the price of the asset. This will amplify the initial shock, might affect other assets, and a full-blown crisis might result. Each bank has behaved prudently, but their collective behaviour has led to a crisis. The business of banking is ripe with externalities, with potential herding and with contagion. These factors may not be visible when looking at individual banks, but they can threaten the stability of the entire system. This is one of the core insights from the financial crisis. Countering the cycle and boosting resilience Indeed, the financial crisis showed us that we had to do more than just look at each part of the system, at each bank. The system as a whole had to be taken into account as well. The microprudential approach must be complemented by a macroprudential approach. And thus, a new policy area was born out of the crisis. Age-wise, macroprudential policy could be the grandchild of policy areas such as banking supervision and monetary policy. It still has to grow up. Theories need to be elaborated, empirical evidence gathered, and practical experience gained. A long childhood lies ahead. But at the same time, much has already been achieved. Over the past few years, we have set up a macroprudential framework for Europe. We have defined objectives, developed tools and set out how different policy areas interact. Let us have a closer look at how macroprudential policy works in Europe. A core concept of macroprudential policy is the financial cycle, that steady succession of ups and downs, of booms and busts. And each time the cycle turns, each time boom goes bust, everyone runs for the exit. Market participants sell the assets concerned, and prices tumble; investors incur losses, as do the banks which financed their investments. This shock might even hit banks which were prudent enough not to participate in the boom. The financial system is so interconnected that even they cannot escape contagion. And as goes the financial system, so goes the real economy. Credit dries up, growth drops off and everyone suffers. This story is a bit simple, of course. Still, it allows us to define two goals of macroprudential policy:  First, make the financial system as a whole more resilient. Second, dampen the cycle of booms and busts. In very general terms, this is what macroprudential policy aims to do in Europe.  The tools of macroprudential policy reflect these objectives. Some of them focus on increasing the resilience of market participants. Take, for example, the countercyclical buffer. It requires banks to set aside more capital in upturns to make them more resilient. Once the downturn sets in, banks can draw on the buffer, which helps them absorb losses. Furthermore, having to set aside more capital in an upturn makes it more costly for banks to grant loans. This might, as a positive side effect, dampen excessive credit growth and hence the cycle. Likewise, reducing capital requirements in a downturn may help to spur lending. Other tools focus on the general resilience of the financial system, going beyond the financial cycle. Various capital buffers have been designed for that purpose. There is, for instance, the systemic risk buffer, which can be applied to all banks or to specific groups of banks. It aims to make banks more resilient to structural risks that affect the entire system. And then there are buffers for globally systemic banks, the G-SII buffers, and for locally systemic banks, the O-SII buffers. By making systemic banks more resilient, these buffers address potential sources of contagion. At the same time, the buffers put a price on the impact systemic banks would have on the financial system and the economy should they fail. This helps to internalise this impact. Micro or macro? Separating the tools Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my speech, I said that macroprudential policy is a relatively new policy area. However, the relevant tools look and feel familiar to banking supervisors. They mostly apply to banks, and often focus on capital. Thus, the distinction between micro and macro is less clear than it should be. This ambiguity might cause conflicts of interest, and this leads us to the question of how to deal with them. The answer is simple: we have to clearly separate the tools of macro- and microprudential policy. To channel the spirit of the famous Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen: each risk needs its own tool.  Let’s start with what is known as Pillar\\xa02 in the context of the Basel framework. Under Pillar\\xa02, supervisors can apply a range of measures to individual banks. The goal is microprudential: address bank-specific risks and bank-specific resilience. Now, under current European rules, Pillar\\xa02 measures could also be used to achieve macroprudential goals. And this could lead to a conflict of interest. Imagine that there is a downturn in the financial cycle. From the viewpoint of each bank, credit risks increase and microprudential supervisors may want to increase Pillar\\xa02 capital demands. Looking at the same trend, macroprudential supervisors might want to support credit growth and counter the cycle over a longer time horizon and from a systemic point of view. Thus, they may want to decrease Pillar\\xa02 capital demands. Who should prevail? And how should Pillar\\xa02 be calculated when two different approaches are used by two different stakeholders? To avoid such tricky questions, Pillar\\xa02 should be defined as a micro tool only – the current review of the Capital Requirements Directive offers the chance to do so. This would help to focus on the initial idea of Pillar\\xa02: determining a bank’s individual level of capital based on the bank’s specific risks. But looking at the macroprudential framework, is it enough just to define Pillar\\xa02 as a purely microprudential tool, or is the macroprudential toolbox lacking in efficient tools? And indeed, the toolbox defined by the EU legal framework may be too small to address all types of systemic risk. The available tools address only those who grant loans – the banks. They neglect those who take out loans – households, for instance. Take, for example, the real estate sector, which often plays a big role in the ups and downs of the financial cycle. When house prices are on the rise, the potential gains from buying a house might be high enough to dwarf any increase in the cost of credit triggered by the countercyclical buffer. Here, borrower-based tools would dampen the boom more effectively. I am thinking, for instance, of loan-to-value ratios, LTVs. In some countries in Europe LTVs and other borrower-based measures are already part of the macroprudential toolbox. Harmonising these tools at European level might be a good next step. At the same time, we should acknowledge that there is a drawback to tools which only focus on banks. The crisis has shown that the financial sector reaches far beyond banks. And when we only tighten rules for banks, certain activities might be shifted to other, less strictly regulated parts of the financial system, namely the non-bank sector. Consequently, risks build up outside the scope of banking regulation and supervision. Eventually, these risks might spill over into the banking sector. So banks might be protected from the first wave of a crisis, but would be hit by the second wave. Ignoring this part of the financial system would leave the door wide open to risks and crises. Thus, there is a need for tools that address non-banks and their business. One of these tools concerns margins and haircuts for securities financing transactions and derivatives. As they stand, these margins and haircuts are pro-cyclical: they go down in a boom, and rise in a bust. Thus, there might be a case for having tools that would make margins and haircuts vary in a more countercyclical manner. To sum up, we need to clearly separate micro- and macro tools, and we need to expand the macro toolbox. But there is more: we also need to clearly separate macro tools from each other. This is particularly relevant in respect of various structural buffers: the O-SII, the G-SII and the systemic risk buffers. Each of these buffers is meant to address a specific structural risk. In practice, however, they are often used to achieve the same goals. In this context, the fact that currently all three buffers are treated in combination might play a role: only the highest of them applies. Given that the buffers for systemically important institutions and the systemic risk buffer are supposed to address different risks, they should rather be set up separately and then added up. The institutional backdrop to macroprudential policy Ladies and gentlemen, so far, I have discussed the tools of macroprudential policy. What I have not discussed are those who apply the tools and how they do so. And this brings me to the institutional backdrop to macroprudential policy. As you can imagine, in Europe this is a complex issue. Macroprudential powers were assigned to the ECB when European banking supervision came into being. This sounds straightforward, but it is not. First of all, the ECB does not have exclusive powers. It shares them with the national authorities. And this makes sense. After all, there is a national angle to systemic risk: financial cycles and structures vary across countries. So sharing powers makes sense but, at the same time, it makes things a bit trickier. How does this work? Well, in fact, it is the national authorities that take macroprudential measures. The ECB then has the power to tighten – or “top up” – those measures that are covered by EU law. This approach seeks to achieve two goals: first, it helps to counter any inaction bias on the part of national authorities. And second, it helps to take into account any cross-border effects. And it’s not just the ECB and the national authorities that are involved. The European Systemic Risk Board, or ESRB for short, and, in certain cases, the European Banking Authority also have a role in assessing the adequacy and implementation of certain macroprudential measures. All in all, a number of different EU institutions may be involved in macroprudential policy, depending on the measure used. The process of activating macroprudential tools is a long and complex one, and it does not promote the proactive and timely use of those tools. In addition, each tool comes with a different activation mechanism. So I am convinced that these activation procedures need to be simplified. And the notification and information procedures need to be harmonised and streamlined too. This could be done, for instance, by establishing the ESRB as the central information hub for all notifications regarding macroprudential measures in the EU. This would reduce the overall notification burden on national authorities. Furthermore, one might think that the authorities were free to choose the tool that they deem best suited to address the risk at hand. Well, not quite.  With regard to certain macroprudential tools, a rigid sequence has to be followed. You can’t implement certain tools without first having considered using other tools. More specifically, if you want to apply tools such as macroprudential liquidity requirements or risk weights to target asset bubbles, you first have to consider tools such as Pillar\\xa02 requirements or various capital buffers. This sequence is known as the “pecking order” of tools. But an effective and efficient macroprudential framework should permit the flexible use of all available tools laid down in EU law to prevent systemic risk. Instruments should be chosen on the basis of their effectiveness, not as a result of mandatory sequencing. The conclusion therefore is that the pecking order should be removed and the activation mechanisms should be harmonised and streamlined. Now, as I said before, macroprudential policy is a relatively new field in terms of both theory and practice. So, two things will happen over time: the theory will advance, and we will gain practical experience. Against this backdrop, the European macroprudential framework should be reviewed on a regular basis. This would help to make it more effective and more efficient. The current situation But the framework is just a means to an end. And that end is to ensure a stable financial system. So, where do we stand on this front? Are there any risks to financial stability in the euro area? We at the ECB currently see four major risks. The first risk is a sudden reversal of risk premia. Recent events have shown that markets can be subject to corrections even when the macroeconomic environment continues to be supportive. So far, the high volatility in the equity market has not spilled over into other markets, which is certainly good news. That said, some market segments need to be closely monitored.  Residential real estate is one such segment. Prices are broadly in line with the average valuations recorded over recent decades. However, in some large cities, real estate prices have increased more rapidly than household income. In addition, prices for prime commercial properties rose strongly in 2017, and the fundamentals suggest that valuations are a bit stretched here. Euro area corporate bond spreads for some lower-rated issuers also look increasingly tight [compared with fundamentals. The second risk lies in the low profitability of banks. As only profitable banks can reliably serve the economy, weak banks are indeed a concern. The third risk is that markets might again doubt the ability of public and private borrowers to service their debt. And finally, there are liquidity risks in the non-bank sector which might spill over into the entire financial system. So, there are risks, but, from the ECB’s point of view, they are not too pronounced. In addition, the euro area economy is recovering, and this will help to alleviate some financial stability concerns. That said, the situation differs from country to country, of course. And as this is Dutch Banking Day, let’s turn our attention to the Netherlands. There are two things in this country that the ECB is watching closely. The first is the real estate sector. Since 2013, prices for residential real estate have been rising strongly. This applies mostly to large cities, where we now see tentative signs of overvaluation. Prices increased faster than household income. But mortgage lending is still growing more slowly than house prices. This seems to be largely due to the fact that many borrowers are repaying existing loans; since 2013, mortgage repayments have totalled around €60\\xa0billion. This has been driven by low interest rates and a gift tax exemption for home purchases. But even when we take this into account, mortgage lending is still growing more slowly than house prices. So other factors are still in play. These include demography and the limited home equity of many households. But it’s not just residential real estate. There is also commercial real estate, and that market is quite large relative to the size of the Dutch economy, mainly because real estate investment funds play a big role in the Netherlands – more so than in other countries. And prices for prime commercial real estate are rising. On average, they are still below peak levels, but, again, we see tentative signs of overvaluation – particularly in large cities. At the same time, loans have begun to grow faster, and lending standards have started to ease – but they are still tight compared with the pre-crisis period. Against this backdrop, both residential and commercial real estate markets need to be closely monitored. And the two markets need to be seen in combination. After all, they are closely linked, and risks might spill over from one to the other. We also keep a close eye on household debt. Over the past few years, households have reduced their debt, but the level is still high. At 106% of GDP, the debt burden of Dutch households is among the highest in the euro area. The same is true of the debt-to-income ratio, which stands at more than 200%. Moreover, as house prices are rising and more loans are being granted, the reduction of debt might come to an end. Against this backdrop, there might be a need for more active macroprudential policy. And by this I mean a tightening of existing borrower-based measures. With that in mind, the Dutch Financial Stability Committee and De Nederlandsche Bank have recommended that maximum loan-to-value, or LTV, ratios be further reduced to 90% over the next ten years. In my view, this is called for. After all, LTV ratios in the Netherlands are higher than in other countries. Combined with the high levels of household debt, this poses a risk to financial stability. In addition, some have been calling for the tax deductions applicable to interest on mortgage loans to be brought down more quickly. Here too, the Netherlands stands out, with higher levels of tax relief for mortgage loans than in other countries. This kind of tax policy has proven to be pro-cyclical and has made the household sector more vulnerable. It would thus be sensible to speed up the reduction of tax relief.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Macroprudential policy is a relatively new thing. And what is new is almost never perfect; that is also true of macroprudential policy. It still has to mature. We still need to refine the theory and translate it into tools that are fit for purpose, policies that work and an institutional architecture that is both lean and stable. All this requires further work and regular reviews of the status quo. Let us now return to the fallacy of composition. Each of you is made up of billions of cells. Each of these cells is unconscious. Therefore, you must be unconscious as well. But unless you fell asleep during my speech, you are very much conscious. I admit that this is a bit more philosophical than macroprudential policy, but the basic idea remains the same: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Thank you for your attention.   ']\n",

We are moving from a world where it is considered normal to wait a day or more for a payment to arrive to a world where payments are delivered in real time. This is overdue as I consider it anachronistic that services in an e-commerce transaction are delivered in real time and even goods sometimes only take a few hours – while the settlement of payments to release such goods and services would take a full business day. Now, payments will be delivered as fast as emails, instant messages and streamed content. I believe that – as was the case in these other industries – end-users, at least the younger and technology-proficient generation, will soon start to expect instant payments. Instant has the potential to become the new normal, and we will wonder how we were ever satisfied with payments arriving only on the next business day. In order to support these demands and enhance customer experience, it is not sufficient to have the infrastructures in place to process payments instantly; payment solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of consumers and businesses are also required. In order to foster a dialogue on such needs, the ECB hosted an event last week at which providers demonstrated the apps they have created to support instant payments and exchanged views about the extent to which they would meet customer needs.  This event reinforced my firm belief that instant payments will be the basis for innovative payment solutions, but at the same time, it is only in combination with these solutions that instant payments will live up to their potential to become the new normal. This is why today I call on the industry to take the next step and develop end-user solutions that will allow consumers and businesses to enjoy the benefits of instant electronic payments in any payment situation, in addition to cash, which is still popular. Instant payments – a tool for innovation in payments Until now, the focus has mainly been on the three basic layers of the instant payments pyramid: the scheme, clearing and settlement layers. Great progress has been made in all three of these:  At the request of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB), the European Payments Council launched the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November 2017, which over 1,000 payment service providers have already joined, with many more set to follow.  Several automated clearing houses in Europe have started clearing SCT Inst transactions, supported by an enhanced settlement module provided by the Eurosystem.  The TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service is scheduled to go live in November 2018, ensuring the pan-European reach of instant payments – which has been one of the main objectives of the ERPB in that context.  These layers form the basis on which new, user-friendly services could be built. However, for instant payments to reach their full potential, a fourth layer is needed: the end-user solution layer. Without efficient, user-friendly end-user solutions, instant payments only make ordinary credit transfers faster – but instant payments can be much more than that: they can be a basis for innovation.  We have recognised the importance of end-user solutions from the beginning. That is why person-to-person (P2P) mobile payments have been a priority for the Eurosystem and the ERPB. A service that will allow people all around Europe to make mobile payments to others, using their mobile phone number as an identifier, is expected to be available by October this year. When people can easily send and receive payments instantly via their mobile phone, the advantages of instant payments will become evident. This makes P2P payments an important first use case – but it should not remain the only one.  If you can instantly send money to a friend, then why not also to a business? Why should merchants have to wait days for funds to arrive, when the infrastructure to process payments instantly is available? Point of sale Instant point-of-sale payments would provide merchants with immediate and final payment – not a claim against the customer or a guarantee from a credit card company, but funds credited to the merchant’s account with finality, like cash. This will improve merchants’ cash flow and allow them to use the received funds immediately, for example to pay their suppliers. It is essential that the “instant at the point of sale” solutions that need to be developed are pan-European in nature, convenient for consumers and technically not too complex for merchants. I call on the payments industry to start working in this direction.  E-commerce In e-commerce, too, instant payments can be an enabler for innovation. Building on what I mentioned earlier, customers must be able to easily initiate an instant payment from an online shopping environment and the merchant must instantly receive confirmation that the payment has been executed. The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) provides a stable legislative framework for such services and aims to foster innovation and competition in this field. The ERPB, taking the revised PSD2 and the close-to-final regulatory technical standards as a basis, has supported the industry in its endeavours to reach agreement on the necessary technical, operational and business elements to ensure the pan-European provision of innovative and competitive payment initiation services. This work is well under way and will be concluded by June this year. In parallel, the European Commission has encouraged a group of market actors to evaluate Application Programming Interface (API) technical specifications to ensure that they will meet market needs and will be fit for purpose when accessing customer accounts to initiate payments.  Security The PSD2 provides many opportunities for innovative services, including, but not limited to, e-commerce payment solutions. Such solutions require standardised access to accounts, but also security throughout the payment chain. The PSD2 regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication strike a good balance between the needs of consumers, third-party providers and banks. They will probably not be applicable until September 2019 at the earliest. Since the main provisions of the PSD2 have been in effect since last month, I call on payment service providers to fulfil the requirements of the regulatory technical standards, even if they are not yet legally required to do so, during the transition period until these standards enter into force. It is in their own interests to do so, as this will guarantee the high security levels that are necessary to retain public trust in the payment system and payment services. Instant payments versus virtual currencies Smart, pan-European instant payment solutions meet the needs of end-users in the digital age, being fast and easy to use as well as safe and reliable. The SCT Inst scheme and the underlying market infrastructure are subject to Eurosystem oversight, and settlement takes place in central bank money. By contrast, so-called virtual currency schemes such as bitcoin, which have been touted by some as the payment method of the future, cannot achieve that. First, bitcoin is not a currency but simply a speculative digital asset. It tends to be processed inefficiently and – by comparison with instant payments – 30 times more slowly, and is about 10,000 times more expensive. The inefficient processing makes transactions costly not just from a financial perspective, but also in terms of the environmental impact. Bitcoin in particular has a large carbon footprint due to the electricity consumption required for its creation and transfer. In addition, because virtual currencies do not have a trusted issuer behind them, they may become worthless at any time. It is not surprising, then, that virtual currencies are not widely accepted as a means of payment.  Conclusion The future of payments is instant and most countries in the euro area are moving with the times. This is a natural development, following the rise of real-time services in other industries. The industry (with the support of the Eurosystem) has stepped up to the challenge and developed a scheme and an infrastructure that enable such services to become the new normal for euro payments. Now it is time to go one step further and provide efficient and innovative end-user solutions that allow consumers and businesses across Europe to make instant payments in any payment situation, especially at the point of sale, where the majority of retail payments are made. I encourage new and existing service providers to take the opportunity to develop pan-European point-of-sale solutions based on instant payments. These solutions should be efficient, user-friendly and secure. As you are all aware, high security standards are essential to retain public trust. I therefore reiterate my call to payment service providers to adhere to the PSD2 regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication as soon as possible, even before they are legally required to do so. By providing services that are safe, as well as fast and convenient, the payments industry will succeed in meeting the needs of a digitalised society.   ']\n",
      "['2018-02-14', 'Yves Mersch', 'The role of euro banknotes as legal tender', 'Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 4th Bargeldsymposium of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 14 February 2018', '  The role of euro banknotes as legal tender   Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 4th Bargeldsymposium of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 14 February 2018 First of all, I would like to thank the Deutsche Bundesbank organisers for inviting me to speak at this symposium. The particularly good cooperation between the various Eurosystem central banks in the field of cash is not only part of our core business. It also serves the people of Europe, for whom euro cash has an important function. But our cash has recently come in for greater criticism.  Last year alone, five Member States[1] consulted the ECB on measures to limit the use of cash. This represents a sharp increase compared with the number of consultations on this topic in previous years. Opposition to cash is coming from different quarters. On the one hand, the “law and order” school says that criminals use cash to finance their illegal activities. Others, meanwhile, who have developed business models involving new electronic payment methods, point to the “cost” of cash. We have to address these arguments.  In the next few minutes, I would like to consider the following questions:  Why does the Treaty[2] grant (privileged) legal tender status to euro banknotes? In other words, why is there legal tender status at all? What is the role of the ECB and the Eurosystem in protecting this status? And what implications does this have for our activities in the Eurosystem?  Euro banknotes, and only euro banknotes, are protected as legal tender under the primary law of Article 128(1) TFEU[3]. But what exactly is legal tender? There is a Commission recommendation on this point[4]. It is not binding. But it does provide for the following key elements:  mandatory acceptance (unless explicitly agreed otherwise)  legally recognised means for repaying a debt, i.e. with a discharging effect at face value, with no levying of additional fees permitted (as is the case, for example, with credit cards).  Precisely what else can be deduced from the legal tender status is a question of interpretation: the Treaty and the binding secondary legislation do not define the content of the legal tender status. The national arrangements of the 19 Member States of the euro area relating to the legal tender status which predate the introduction of the euro continue to apply. In practice, they determine the concrete effects of the legal tender[5] in daily payment transactions. This includes restrictions on the use of the legal tender by way of national regulatory arrangements. Such restrictions can certainly vary from one Member State to another, but the legal tender status as such, so to speak the “nature” of our banknotes, including the core elements of this status mentioned before, must be preserved. We monitor this. I’ll come back to this shortly. Why does legal tender status exist at all? The relevant provision in the Treaty[6] does not itself constitute a fundamental right or is not equivalent to a fundamental right (in any case not according to prevailing opinion). So there is no “right to cash” or “right to cash payment in all cases”. But the granting of legal tender status to euro banknotes under the TFEU, and thus at constitutional level, does concern fundamental rights and fulfils at the same time an important institutional function. Euro banknotes do not exist “for their own sake” or to allow us central banks to obtain seigniorage, but for reasons that are protected under constitutional law. Cash as legal tender facilitates freedom Cash, as a medium of transaction in many instances, opens the way for the exercise of many fundamental rights – it costs money to live and money has to be earned. Cash allows privacy and thus safeguards fundamental rights, such as the right to “informational self-determination”, freedom of action and freedom of speech. Citizens can use cash to exercise their fundamental rights without the state or other third parties being able to immediately track any financial transactions involved. This aspect is particularly relevant considering the criticism I mentioned before that cash-facilitated privacy aids and abets criminal activities. Protection of privacy matters to all of us. Privacy protects people from the risk of a surveillance state and thought police. No particular link can be established statistically between cash and criminal activities. The focus must be on the fight against crime. Cash must not be made the scapegoat. It’s astonishing that alternative means of payment, such as bitcoin – very popular among cybercriminals – are subject to much less criticism than cash despite the risks they entail and the scope for misuse. Cash as legal tender allows equality and participation The store-of-value function of cash is directly linked to property rights.[7]  The easy accessibility to cash, especially for the elderly, the socially vulnerable or minors, allows people to participate in society and, for example, allows children to learn how to handle money. In particular, when socially vulnerable people use cash, they face none of the barriers involved in applying for a credit card or, despite all their efforts, opening a current account. Cash as legal tender provides security and protection Cash “always works”. If alternative means of payment are no longer possible, e.g. because of a power or network failure, society can continue to function because of cash – in any case as long as the ATMs work or we manage, for example, in times of crisis to replace this infrastructure unbureaucratically. Cash thus clearly enhances the resilience of society and ensures its functioning particularly in critical periods. Many people use cash to buy everyday items, but not to pay larger sums. They cleverly weigh up the risks, burdens and benefits, such as protecting their privacy by making anonymous cash payments. The statistics show that “average” Europeans have about €1,600 net at their disposal every month. Once rent and other fixed costs have been deducted, many people evidently carry out “cash-suitable” transactions above all. Of course, “shoe leather costs” play an important role in people’s calculations, such as the distance from an ATM or the acceptance of euro cash abroad. People who frequently have to handle large sums of money or who, for business or private reasons, often (have to) stay in other currency areas may find it practical to make their payments with a card and not to have to go first to an ATM or a bureau de change. But that certainly doesn’t mean that these people – especially here in Germany – would be willing to give up their cash. What is the role of the ECB and the Eurosystem in protecting the legal tender? The ECB, as the European institution at the heart of the Eurosystem, has a particular role to play, and not just in terms of monetary policy in general. As the central bank which authorises the issuance of euro banknotes,[8] the ECB is also responsible in particular for protecting the status of euro cash as the sole legal tender. This includes guaranteeing the existence of euro cash and its usability as legal tender. In fulfilling these tasks, the ECB ultimately ensures that people can go about their lives, with their fundamental rights protected, using euro banknotes and coins. The ECB establishes the legal framework that protects euro banknotes, for example. We decide what types of reproduction are permitted[9] and, together with the national central banks, clamp down on unauthorised reproductions[10]. This helps to preserve public confidence in euro cash. We keep a constant eye on costs, in terms of regulation too, to ensure that the provision of cash remains cost-effective. Here we have an obligation to the public to increase efficiency even further. We ensure that cash retains its scope for use and we take action if the legal tender status is at risk..  In the legislative field, our efforts to protect and safeguard the currency mainly take the form of ECB opinions on legislative proposals at national or EU level which relate to our tasks. The ECB has to be consulted on all such legislative proposals,[11] especially when they have the effect of limiting the legal tender status of euro banknotes. Until 2016, these consultations by Member States on limiting the use of cash were a routine exercise. From the first consultations the ECB established the position[12] that national measures in this area must:   have a legitimate purpose and to that end be proportionate, that is  suitable, necessary and adequate.  “Suitable” in this case means that the planned legislative measures will actually be able to achieve their aim, i.e. that they are efficient and effective. On the basis of this position, the ECB has recognised, in particular, the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion as legitimate purposes. There has been no criticism when Member States have planned proportionate measures to address these issues. Since around 2016, and with the peak I mentioned in 2017, the ECB, with increasing regularity, has had to address in detail the topic of limits to cash payments. We have maintained a consistent position on this and, for the first time, we found ourselves having to comment on measures that were not suitable.  These measures involved limiting the use of cash for transactions that are not subject to tax. The national legislator had justified the measures on the grounds that they would help prevent tax evasion. However, limits on non-taxable payments do not help to combat tax evasion[13]. With due respect for the prerogative of the legislator to evaluate the matter, the ECB must point out such errors of assessment. We also faced for the first time, in the context of a consultation on a very low proposed cash limit, the question of whether the legal tender status of a banknote is undermined if limits on cash payments make it impossible to use a certain denomination in transactions[14]. This would be tantamount to abolishing that denomination. But only the Governing Council of the ECB can make such decisions about the denominations of euro banknotes, and that includes the decision on whether to discontinue certain denominations. So there must be scope for all denominations of the legal tender to be used, otherwise this competence of the Governing Council would be undermined. General, non-sector-specific limits on cash which largely preclude the use of a denomination are therefore likely to be very difficult to justify. In this context, I would like to comment on our decision on the €500 banknote. We have decided not to issue a €500 banknote in the second series of euro banknotes. However, €500 banknotes from the first series – which some Europeans probably have under their mattresses – retain their status as legal tender. So people need not worry that their €500 banknotes will lose their value and can continue to use them as a means of payment. Ultimately, the Treaty includes a limit to limits on cash by assigning legal tender status to the euro banknote denominations as determined by the Governing Council of the ECB. We at the ECB monitor compliance with this provision. We would also intervene – but fortunately have not yet had to – if there were cases of discrimination against cash as legal tender compared with alternative private payment methods. This could happen, for example, if a payment fee were to be levied. You will recall that a core feature of legal tender is that banknotes must be accepted at their face value. Anyone who has paid by card when booking a flight is aware of the difference. In the case of card payments, additional payment fees are allowed and are standard practice. Conclusion: What are the implications for our activities within the Eurosystem? I will conclude by saying that printed euro banknotes will retain their place and their role in society as legal tender for a very long time to come. There is no viable alternative to euro cash. There is good reason to believe that banknotes don’t only have to take the form of printed paper, cotton or polymer. However, printed banknotes will remain our core business. And if there is public demand for digital central bank money, this should only be a technical variant of cash. Alternative payment methods cannot replace euro cash; they can only complement it. The Eurosystem must therefore continue to ensure the existence of euro cash. This is the only way we can safeguard the role that euro banknotes and coins play in protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Europe. Protecting the legal tender status of our banknotes will still call for a high level of vigilance from the ECB and the NCBs, in particular in order to prevent unwarranted limits and thereby ensure support for the euro and its existence. New legislative initiatives, such as those at EU level to define what constitutes legal tender, require intensive dialogue between the ECB and the legislators. Thank you for your attention.

Others, such as forward guidance on the future direction of policy, were a more recent invention, but had been used with some regularity even before the crisis erupted in 2007. And some instruments, such as moderately negative interest rates, were more specific to certain jurisdictions. Overall, these measures have been very effective and helped set in train the synchronous expansion the global economy is currently experiencing.  As the global economy emerges from the greatest slump since the end of the Second World War, the focus is on calibrating the degree of monetary accommodation that is still required. In the United States, where real GDP returned to pre-crisis peak level back in 2011, the tightening cycle has been under way for some time. The Federal Reserve stabilised its monetary policy portfolio in October 2014 and started to raise the federal funds rate more than a year later. More recently, it has started to reduce its balance sheet.  In the euro area, the sovereign debt crisis meant that the cyclical recovery took considerably longer to materialise than across the Atlantic. Real GDP did not return to its pre-crisis peak level until 2015, four years later than in the United States.  Nevertheless, the euro area is currently experiencing a solid and broad-based economic expansion, with the economy in 2017 growing at its fastest pace for a decade. The very accommodative monetary policy measures we have taken since 2014 are judged to have had a significant impact on output growth. Looking ahead, real GDP growth is projected to remain consistently above potential growth in the coming years. Despite these favourable developments, inflation continues to be lacklustre and to date is not receiving sufficient support from underlying inflationary pressures. While our measures have clearly played a decisive role in keeping inflation expectations anchored and have contributed to an improved inflation outlook, an ample degree of monetary accommodation therefore remains necessary to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  How is our monetary policy likely to evolve in the foreseeable future?   Our monetary policy stance is currently determined by the combination and mutual interaction of the asset purchase programme (APP), our policy rates and our forward guidance on each of these tools. Additional stimulus is provided by the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which will remain outstanding for the next three years. Once our key interest rates had reached exceptionally low levels, the APP became for all practical purposes the primary policy tool for calibrating our monetary policy stance. This is why, since January 2015, we have been signalling the traditionally tight connection between the ECB’s monetary policy and the price stability objective by linking an assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation to the size and duration of our net asset purchases. Accordingly, we have consistently communicated our intention to continue with our chosen pace of monthly net purchases until we see “a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim”. In addition, the pledge to reinvest the proceeds from the principal payments that accrue from the maturing securities in our portfolio should be seen as a necessary complement to the net asset purchases. Forward guidance on both policy rates and the APP plays a key role in determining our monetary policy stance. Its function has evolved significantly over time. In July 2013, when we announced for the first time that we expected our “key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time”, forward guidance on interest rates was intended as a protective measure to insulate the euro area money market from the global financial turmoil that had followed the “taper tantrum” a few weeks earlier.  As the macroeconomic environment deteriorated in late 2013 and early 2014, our policy needed to become distinctly more accommodative, and forward guidance turned into a vehicle for easing the monetary policy stance. Forward guidance has not taken the same form across all major economies, differing in terms of both its degree of conditionality and the instruments to which it is attached In the euro area, since the APP has been in place, forward guidance has been extended to key parameters of our purchases and has helped investors form expectations about the size of the APP and its duration. In particular, we have indicated a minimum horizon – an intended end-date – until which time we plan to carry out net monthly purchases, while retaining the option of extending the programme beyond that intended end-date if the “sustained adjustment” condition has not been met. The mutually reinforcing nature of our forward guidance on policy rates and the APP became even more evident in March 2016, when the Governing Council clarified the future sequencing of these two instruments. By stating that policy rates were expected to remain at present levels “well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”, the Governing Council made it clear that keeping policy rates well anchored for the entire lifespan of the asset purchases was an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact. Looking ahead, monetary policy will evolve in a data-dependent and time-consistent manner. The transition towards policy normalisation will begin once the Governing Council judges that there is a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. This assessment will be based on three criteria for the inflation outlook: convergence, confidence and resilience. Convergence implies that headline inflation will have to be on course to reach levels below, but close to, 2% by the end point of a meaningful medium-term horizon. This first criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a sustained adjustment. The Governing Council needs to be confident that the expectation of an upward adjustment in inflation has a sufficiently high probability of being realised on a sustainable basis. So, a sufficient degree of confidence in our inflation projections will be a key requirement for declaring that a sustained adjustment has been achieved. Our third criterion, resilience, measures the robustness of inflation convergence to a partial withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. Ultimately, we will need to verify that inflation would remain on a sustained path of adjustment even in a less accommodative monetary policy environment.  The lessons learnt from the financial crisis have shown that it is crucial to test the confidence criterion and assess the resilience of the economy and of transmission to a partial withdrawal of accommodation.  The strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction of economic slack and increasing capacity utilisation strengthen our confidence that inflation will converge towards our aim. However, measuring the degree of remaining unutilised resources in the economy remains challenging. In the labour market, the elasticity of labour supply during the recovery has been greater than assumed in our baseline scenario. This can be partly attributed to pension and labour market reforms as well as to migratory flows. Increased labour supply has resulted in muted wage dynamics, thereby keeping a lid on underlying price pressures. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding the upward path in inflation that we consider in our baseline scenario is still too high. Experience demonstrates the importance of our third criterion, resilience. Monetary policymakers always face a delicate balancing act at turning points in monetary policy. In 2011, when we increased interest rates, economic activity indicators were pointing to buoyancy and, of course, inflation was high on account of oil prices. Hindsight gives us today a clearer view of the underlying conditions of the economy than it was possible to have at the time, and we now know that the apparent robustness of the economy was in fact masking vulnerabilities that made the economy prone to sudden reversals. And in the summer of that year, a sudden reversal was indeed what we saw. In 2013, we experienced a similar, if less dramatic, difficulty in our assessment of the economic situation. Over that year, banks started to repay the funds that they had borrowed under the two three-year LTROs which we had offered between late 2011 and early 2012. Many observers at the time interpreted this massive reimbursement – including from banks that had been hit particularly hard by the sovereign debt crisis – as a sign of normalisation. In reality, it was a symptom of the aggressive deleveraging that banks were pursuing, which made ECB borrowing unnecessary and costly to maintain on-balance sheet for many of them. While reimbursing excess liquidity made a lot of sense from the individual bank’s micro-perspective, it was hurting the economy in the aggregate. Today, we want to make sure that the economy is on a sufficiently robust footing before there is a turn in policy. From that perspective, there is still some way to go before all three criteria for a sustained adjustment are met at the same time. So, we still need patience and persistence in our monetary policy.  We need patience because it takes time for price pressures to build up. And we need persistence because the pick-up in inflation is the result of the prevailing monetary policy stance. If the flow of incoming data were to confirm the expectation of a gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, this would not necessarily be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment as less supportive monetary policy conditions could imperil the inflation trajectory.  Once the Governing Council judges that the three criteria for sustained adjustment have been met, net asset purchases will expire, in line with our guidance. From that point in time, the evolution of inflation will remain conditional on reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time, and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation stabilises durably around levels below, but close to, 2%.

The evolution of money in the digital age', 'Lecture by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, London, 8 February 2018', '  Virtual or virtueless? The evolution of money in the digital age   Lecture by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, London, 8 February 2018 European folklore warns of the will-o’-the-wisp, a malignant creature that dwelt in marshes. It would appear as a light in the distance, which a traveller would mistake for houses. As they reached the place where they thought the light was, it would move further ahead, drawing them deeper into the marsh to their untimely death and a watery grave. In some areas, will-o’-the-wisps were said to mark buried treasure. Investigation of the phenomenon found it was related to dissipating bubbles of marsh gas.[1]  With the draining of marshes to make way for agricultural land, will-o’-the-wisps are rarely sighted nowadays. But there remain plenty of distant flashing lights to distract travellers with promises of riches. As with the previous incarnation, these flashing lights often turn out to be just like bubbles of marsh gas – insubstantial and foul-smelling, but also flammable and sometimes able to burn things around them. The most recent beguiling wisps are named variously “cryptocurrencies” – to denote the use of cryptographic methods and technology – or “virtual currencies” (VCs) – to denote their lack of legal recognition. There are, at present, more than 1,500 VCs in circulation, with dozens of new schemes being launched monthly, including initial coin offerings (ICOs). Most have failed to attract users, in particular in the major currency areas. The total value outstanding has fluctuated sharply, largely from speculative activity.  The global value of all VCs is currently around a fifth of the value of all euro banknotes in circulation and around 3% of the narrow monetary aggregate M1. Of course, these figures are probably already out of date, such is the volatility of the market. Having a million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin today would have required the simple investment of three million dollars in mid-December. Because holders can hide their identity and location, it is impossible to accurately analyse VC circulation in the euro area. But euro-related activity on exchanges represents a small share of global activity, and is concentrated on a small number of users. While VCs remained an esoteric interest, it seemed sufficient for authorities to mostly observe and issue warnings here and there. But it is the dose that makes the poison. Now that VCs may grow to be economically significant, we need to reduce the risk of negative impacts on the economy. In my remarks today, I wish to explain what it takes for something to be considered “money” – and how VCs measure up. I will then set out what I believe are some of the key regulatory questions that need addressing, and actions that need to be taken to mitigate the potential blowback from VCs to the rest of the financial system.  What is money? Money has formed an integral part of human economic interaction for millennia. It has appeared in many forms – metallic currency, paper notes, cowry shells, cigarettes and even the great Rai stones of Yap.[2] Are VCs the latest incarnation of money? The answer for now, and indeed for the foreseeable future, is no. Economists generally define money as being a verifiable asset that fulfils three basic functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.[3] How well do VCs carry out those functions? Medium of exchange Some VCs have attained patchy acceptance as a medium of exchange. The current largest, Bitcoin, is accepted by some retail outlets, but on a global scale these outlets remain small in number, and hardly any actual transactions have taken place. On a daily basis, there are around 284,000 Bitcoin transactions globally, compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area. Indeed, a recent Bitcoin conference stopped receiving payment in Bitcoin because of the cost and time involved in processing the payments.[4]  Bitcoin is far inferior to existing payment options. Bitcoin transactions generally require confirmation from six miners. With each block taking around ten minutes to mine, you would expect transactions to take an hour to process. But with recent network congestion, the average time for one confirmation can easily exceed several hours.  At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with Bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed.[5]  Bitcoin payments are also expensive. The recent cost of a Bitcoin transaction is €25, the same cost as carrying out 12,500 transactions on the incoming TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS). Bitcoin is heavily resource intensive, and certainly not a green technology. Bitcoin mining is estimated to currently consume energy at an annual rate of 46 TWh,[6] approximately 35 times the electricity consumption of all Tesla cars in the world. In comparison, traditional payment services have made large strides in innovation. The instant payments scheme SCT-Inst was launched in November 2017 and the Eurosystem will implement the TIPS service in November 2018. A key characteristic of the instant payments scheme is that funds are made available to the beneficiary in, at most, 10 seconds for 0.2 euro cents. In TIPS, we aim to settle those transactions within a fraction of a second, in central bank money, with Europe-wide reach and interoperability. So it is with conventional technology, not with VCs, that genuine progress is being made in payment processing. Unit of account The second function of money is acting as a unit of account, without which buyers and sellers would have to know how many chickens an iPhone would be worth, how many iPhones would buy a house, and so forth. Such a system quickly becomes complex: just ten products already have 45 bilateral pairs of prices. Money simplifies the comparisons of value between products. VCs fail this test – none of them are generally accepted as a unit of account. A unit of account is like a flag or an anthem, a representation of commonness backed by assets and values which is even accepted beyond the territory of legal tender. In part this is due to the lack of widespread recognition. VCs are not legal tender, and are not backed by a central bank. Retailers accepting such assets as payment undertake notable risks, including potential expropriation by hacking or by an enforced rollback.[7] But the lack of acceptance as a unit of account is also down to the final function of money – being a store of value. Store of value Wild fluctuations in the value of VCs mean that businesses pricing in VCs could find themselves with a large and detrimental gap between their actual price and their optimal price. A stable value is required to underpin effective pricing. Similarly, households benefit from being able to optimise their spending over time by saving. To do so, they need an effective store of value that they can be sure will enable them to buy goods and services in the future. When there is considerable uncertainty around how many goods and services an asset can buy in the future, or indeed whether it can be used to purchase anything at all, it is a poor store of value. Traditional currencies have a trusted issuing authority that acts as a guarantor of the stability of the currency, and a legal framework that punishes counterfeiters. The ECB’s mandate for price stability, bolstered by the treaty provision for independence, provides consumers with the confidence that the purchasing power of their euro will remain stable from year to year. The political capital the leaders of the euro area’s countries invested during the crisis to confirm the integrity of the euro proved all sceptics wrong. There are no equivalent structures in place for VCs. They have neither intrinsic value, such as the commodity content of gold coins, nor extrinsic value, such as the value assigned to traditional fiat currencies by the trusted public issuing authority. VCs do not even provide the dividend or coupon payments that tie down the prices of equities and bonds. They are in fact a classic Keynesian beauty contest,[8] where investors buy what they perceive others view as the most attractive investment. Like in Mr Ponzi’s schemes, those investors hope for future price gains and believe they will find a greater fool to sell to before the inevitable crash. Under these conditions, VCs exhibit wild fluctuations in value, meaning that they cannot be trusted as a store of value.  It is this failure, more than any other, that makes the label “currency” a misnomer.  Public versus private provision of money Having a widely accepted unit of account and medium of exchange helps smooth economic transactions, reduce costs and enable some interactions to take place that would not be possible under a pure barter system.[9] There are clear network and scale effects with money, which provide one justification for public issuance. Even Milton Friedman recognised this, noting that “a moderately stable monetary framework seems an essential prerequisite for the effective operation of a private market economy. It is dubious that the market can by itself provide such a framework. Hence, the function of providing one is an essential governmental function on a par with the provision of a stable legal framework.”[10]  But that does not mean that private sector money is either impossible or undesirable. Forgotten amid the hype surrounding VCs is that a widely accepted form of private sector digital money already exists: bank deposits. This private sector money dwarfs the amount of public sector money – i.e. cash – in circulation. In November 2017, euro notes and coins in circulation amounted to €1.1 trillion, compared with the €17.5 trillion deposited by euro area residents with MFIs. Certainly this private sector money acts as an effective medium of exchange and, a few episodes aside, as an effective store of value. But such private sector money is not truly independent; it shares its unit of account with the official currency. The implicit promise underlying bank deposits is that customers can redeem them whenever they wish and one to one with public sector cash, if they need a safe refuge in a time of crisis. By providing liquidity to the banking sector and acting as lenders of last resort, central banks de facto recognise this private sector money, even if it is not legal tender. But that recognition comes with obligations – including regulations on capital, liquidity, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CTF). For VCs to cross over into the mainstream, regulatory acceptance is necessary, and that acceptance requires equivalent measures for governance and legal certainty. Potential impact of virtual currencies Yet even if VCs are not money, central banks should still be aware of the potential risks they pose for price stability and financial stability. The magnitude of such risks depends on the total value of VCs outstanding, their interconnectedness with the rest of the economy, and the extent to which investors in VCs are leveraged.  In terms of interconnectedness, the main concerns would be if a significant crash caused losses of wealth that were large enough to affect consumer behaviour, or caused contagion through the financial system. The bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 provides a useful comparison for the first scenario. The market valuation of the NASDAQ fell by around $5 trillion between March 2000 and October 2002, roughly 20 times the current total value of VCs outstanding. How holders of VCs consume out of their perceived wealth and how much is built on leverage are crucial to determining the impact of a crash. Until recently, VCs have lacked perceptible connections to the financial system. Regulatory requirements on the use of certain types of money or settlements, the high risk of money laundering associated with the lack of customer identification, the speculative pricing of VCs and the limited liquidity are some of the reasons why regulated institutions have refrained from getting involved in this asset class.  Yet there are signs that greed has weakened their resolve and some have begun to form tentative linkages. A number of derivative products pertaining to VCs have recently been launched. There is rising activity in euro at VC exchanges and some jurisdictions are falling over each other to issue licences to largely unregulated platforms and exchanges in a misplaced competitive race. What happens if this trend continues and VCs become more commonplace as settlement assets in some niches of financial markets? What if credit institutions start developing larger exposures to these assets? What if retail investors take out mortgages to buy VCs? Amid the growing risks of contagion and contamination of the existing financial system, regional regulatory solutions have to be explored while we await an outcome from G20 discussions. Indeed, we ultimately need global answers in the absence of a defined jurisdiction for VC issuance.  This is crucial to safeguard the integrity of financial sector services, avoid the undue mutualisation of risks, protect investors and consumers and prevent negative spillovers to the real economy.  Resolute ring-fencing measures might be needed. Reviewing and updating legislation in a timely fashion is a continuous challenge, yet inaction could be perceived as condoning VCs.  The four broad areas that require particular attention are:   VCs themselves;  the facilitators – VC exchanges, wallet-providers and brokers;  financial market infrastructures (FMIs); and, the banking sector.  Regulating virtual currencies Beginning with the VCs themselves, it is clear that they cannot be directly regulated or overseen in the absence of a centralised governance and legal framework. In fact, most VCs are “mined” peripherally by a computer programme explicitly to prevent any legal entity being in control. Recognising their limits here, most countries tolerate the usage of VCs, without trying to ban them.  Many regulatory bodies and central banks have issued warnings, and this is certainly important from a consumer protection viewpoint. Retail investors need to understand the predominantly speculative nature of VCs and the risks they entail. Statements regarding returns on investment in VC-related advertisements targeting potential investors should be under the same level of scrutiny as advertisements for financial products. In the United States, awareness of the growing inherent risks to investors and consumers is on the rise. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees the US investment industry, warned in a letter sent last month to two trade groups that, “there are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.” The SEC outlined more than 30 questions that had to be answered before it would give the green light to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in Bitcoin and its peers.  The concerns refer in particular to the establishment of Bitcoin ETFs, some of which even use leverage to amplify the price movements. The extreme volatility in recent months highlights the large degree of speculation involved.  Likewise, the lack of liquidity is concerning. If many investors want to withdraw their money from the ETFs on a particular day, the funds might struggle to meet the redemptions because they would struggle to sell off their atypical assets. And how would such funds deal with cases of market manipulation, as have happened in the past?[11] Clarity on such aspects is vital. In the same vein, relevant market authorities should monitor, analyse and regulate the use of ICOs. An ICO is a way of raising money from the public, often to start a project or to finance a company, using coins or tokens. In an ICO, an entity issues newly created coins or tokens and offers them in exchange for fiat currencies, such as the euro, but more often VCs. In 2016, the total amount of funds raised through ICOs was less than €82 million. This number has dramatically increased to over €3 billion raised through ICOs in 2017. Potential explanations for the increasing popularity of ICOs is that they allow companies to raise funds without ceding control to venture capital investors, or enduring the rigour and expense of an IPO process involving a legally binding prospectus, among other things. Depending on their features and characteristics, ICOs can be regarded as either the issuance of VCs, as utility tokens to access or purchase a service or product, or as securities. In the latter case in particular, clarification is needed on the extent to which ICOs should be bound by existing regulations, such as on disclosure and prospectuses. This is particularly relevant when tokens are exchanged for fiat money. Restraining the facilitators Let me turn to the facilitators of the spread of VCs.  Vigilance is warranted in view of the repeated incidents, most recently the hack of the Tokyo-based VC exchange Coincheck, where €430 million of virtual currency was stolen. Although there is no specific evidence to confirm the suspicions, security experts are increasingly warning that VCs could offer rogue states a route to circumvent sanctions and gain access to foreign currency and world markets. The ECB takes an active role within our mandate, for example our opinion on the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which will extend the scope of obliged entities to cover exchanges and wallet-providers handling VCs, in order to avoid anonymous transfers into fiat currencies. The ECB reminded the EU legislative bodies that they should not be perceived, through regulatory forbearance, to be promoting VCs, and should take VCs’ inherent stability risks into consideration. But we need a broader perspective on regulatory intervention for VC facilitators that extends beyond the fields of AML and CTF. Possible regulatory action should be explored, as well as amending or broadening existing frameworks such as the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) so that the licensing and supervision rules also apply to VC facilitators. Protecting financial market infrastructures Third, I would like to cover financial market infrastructure services. One could envisage a major incident involving VCs triggering contagion from the market infrastructure services themselves to their participants, and even beyond. Against this background, we have to review whether the regulatory and oversight tools in the field of trading, clearing and settlement require updating.  One of the key questions is whether VCs could become a settlement asset in payments and settlement services or be used in the clearing domain. Existing standards for FMIs, for example, refer to the usage of “a settlement asset with little or no credit and liquidity risk[12]”. While it could be argued that this by and large excludes settlement involving VCs in payment systems, it should be borne in mind that this definition currently does not systematically apply to all FMIs. The situation is similar in the field of securities settlement. The question is whether VCs could be used as an asset for settling securities transactions or constitute a security per se. The answer hinges on whether they could be legally characterised as “financial instrument/financial asset” under the applicable regulation.  Certain authorities have already qualified VCs as financial instruments or commodities and this may prepare the ground for the issuance of some specific VC-related products, including derivatives. VC derivative activities need to be fully transparent and records must be collected, maintained and made available by trade repositories.  The use of VCs at central counterparties (CCP) should also be monitored. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) states that a CCP shall accept highly liquid collateral with minimal credit and market risk to cover its initial and ongoing exposure to its clearing members. While it is doubtful that a VC would meet such a requirement, clear guidelines ex ante would be helpful, and financial stability considerations will need to be taken into account by the relevant authorities. In my view, it should be examined whether any VC activity carried out by FMIs must be ring-fenced from their other activities. The enforcement of segregated accounts and liabilities could be discussed. FMIs play an important role in financial markets, and any liquidity support offered by central banks should be to mitigate shocks emanating from the real economy, not from gambling in risky assets. Certainly, FMIs should not be obliged by legislation to provide settlement services for VCs and VC-related products. In the same vein, the Eurosystem market infrastructure services – TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities – cannot grant access to VC business according to their existing framework. Regulating credit institutions Finally, we need to look at the banking sector, whose profitability and stability might be impaired by VC activities. EU credit institutions are already required to have adequate frameworks in place to assess the capital they need to cover the nature and level of risks they are, or might be, exposed to. Given the volatile nature of VCs, it could seem appropriate that any trading in VCs would be backed by adequate rates of capital, and segregated from their other trading and investment activity.  Any VC business of credit institutions needs to be rigorously supervised to ensure that risks emerging from such activities are contained. This includes ensuring that proper protocols are in place to meet obligations under AML and CTF regulations. Furthermore, given the risks posed by leverage, credit institutions should not accept VCs as collateral, or only accept them with haircuts that appropriately reflect past volatility, liquidity, and market and operational risks. Likewise, limits on leverage could be examined.  Central bank issuance of digital currency The advent of VCs has triggered suggestions that central banks should provide central bank digital currency, or digital base money (DBM), as I have previously called it.[13] DBM already exists in terms of the reserves of the banking sector held at the central bank, but the more recent question is whether central banks should make DBM more widely available.  As with every central bank policy decision, any such move would need to be both necessary and proportionate. There would need to be a clear motivation within our mandate to issue DBM, and such issuance would need to be done in a way that did not bring about risks and costs that exceeded the benefits. It is important to avoid being beguiled by the flashing lights of novelty and assuming that, just because a technology is new, it is also better. There is no material evidence that abolishing cash will inhibit crime. Electronic storage and transfer may well prove easier for criminals than banknotes. I’m also uncertain why cash is being singled out; mobile phones and cars are also used in crime, but there are no calls for their abolition.   Moreover, there does not appear to be a global trend towards a cashless society. A recent study conducted by the ECB finds that around 79% of all payments at point-of-sale were made with cash. Indeed, the demand for cash in the euro area currently outstrips the rate of nominal GDP growth. And people who currently prefer electronic payments already have a wide range of options available, without needing the central bank to provide the digital money. A further argument for introducing DBM and abolishing cash is framed in terms of monetary policy. Several authors have proposed DBM as a way to eliminate the effective lower bound on interest rates, and impose much more negative interest rates than are currently possible. But such rates are not necessary; the unconventional measures put in place by central banks over the past decade have proven sufficient to meet the challenges of the crisis. And while sharply negative interest rates may work well in some macroeconomic models, unforeseen changes in real-world behaviour by households and businesses could inhibit the effectiveness of this tool and achieve nothing more than the destruction of confidence in central bank money. Whether this would work to the advantage of private moneys with large disorders in exchangeability remains to be seen from a social welfare point of view. The decision on issuing DBM also needs to be assessed in relation to the impact on the financial system. During a systemic banking crisis, holding risk-free central bank issued DBM could become vastly more attractive than bank deposits. There could be a sector-wide run on bank deposits, magnifying the effects of the crisis. Even in the absence of a crisis, readily convertible DBM could completely crowd out bank deposits – putting the existence of the two-tier banking system at risk. In this situation, the efficient flow of credit to the economy would likely be impaired. The central bank – now holders of deposit funding – would have to decide which projects were financed, either directly by replacing commercial banks, or indirectly by deciding which banks received funding. This is an undesirable situation for European central bankers for two reasons:   Legally, the Treaty provides for the ECB to operate in an open market economy. And, by the same logic, we are well aware of Friedrich von Hayek’s warnings about “the pretence of knowledge”.[14] Decentralised market decisions are the “first choice” when it comes to allocating resources in an optimal way. This includes the allocation of credit.  Overall, there is currently no convincing motivation for the Eurosystem to issue DBM to the general public. It is unnecessary at present and, when the likely negative impacts on the financial system are taken into account, such a move appears disproportionate to the aims put forward by its proponents. There is no need to fix something that is not broken.  If anything, one could imagine a digital representation of cash that replicates the features of cash in the reasonably distant future, if citizens demanded it. Such an approach seems more appropriate for jurisdictions whose currencies face domestic regress as they are also not widely accepted beyond their territory – which is certainly not the case for the euro. Conclusion Let me conclude. Virtual currencies are not money, nor will they be for the foreseeable future. Their market share is still small and their ties to the real economy are still limited.  But this can be subject to change. Regulators and legislators on all levels should therefore urgently pay close attention to mitigating the potential risks that could stem from growing VC business.  It is not unknown for new innovations to bring about euphoria and hype, which in turn fuel bubbles that eventually burst. And indeed, the hot air is already escaping from some of these bubbles. But just because the initial euphoria and hype subsequently fade, it does not mean that the innovation is without virtue, even if early market leaders may not last the distance. Despite the many defaulted railroad bonds, railways are a common mode of transport today. From London you can even take a train directly to many parts of Europe through the Channel Tunnel – whose now profitable operator filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006. Netscape and AltaVista were titans in the early days of the internet. Web browsers and search engines are still with us, but those names are no more. So it may well prove with VCs. The technology may in time become widespread and useful, but early versions of it may fade from view.      [1] L.

      "['2018-02-05', 'Mario Draghi', 'European Parliament plenary debate on the ECB Annual Report for 2016', 'Introductory statement and closing remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Strasbourg, 5 February 2018', '  European Parliament plenary debate on the ECB Annual Report for 2016   Introductory statement and closing remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Strasbourg, 5 February 2018 Introductory statement Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to be here to discuss with you the ECB’s activities and your draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report 2016.  Today’s debate represents a good opportunity to take stock of progress made and discuss the way forward. A decade ago, the global financial crisis was starting. Today, while further efforts are needed to overcome its legacy, the euro area economy is expanding and employment is rising.  Your draft resolution points out that monetary policy has played a key role in this recovery process. The ECB has indeed acted decisively, in line with its mandate. We have addressed financial fragmentation and supported the economy, enabling inflation to gradually converge towards our objective. The draft resolution also notes that the independence of the ECB has allowed us to take resolute action within our mandate. But independence is just one of the cornerstones of our institutional framework. Accountability is its necessary counterpart. And you, as the representatives of the people of the EU, are the heart of our accountability. Together, independence and accountability underpin our effectiveness and our legitimacy. In my remarks today, I will focus on two particular issues that have been raised in the draft resolution. First, I will elaborate on economic developments in the euro area and the role of the ECB’s monetary policy. Second, I will discuss the state of the financial sector and the measures needed to further strengthen its resilience. Economic developments and the role of the ECB’s monetary policy  The euro area economy is expanding robustly, with stronger growth rates than previously expected and significantly above potential. According to preliminary data, euro area real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2017, compared to the 1.7% that had been foreseen in our December 2016 staff projections for the same year.  The economic expansion is broad-based. The dispersion of growth rates across countries and across sectors is at its lowest level for 20 years. Accordingly, we see positive growth in over 85% of the sectors in the euro area economy, compared with an historical average of 74%. Employment growth has recently strengthened as well in all the main sectors, namely in industry, construction and market services. These developments bode well for economic growth, as expansions tend to be stronger and more resilient when growth is broad-based.  The number of people employed in the euro area has also increased by around 7.5 million since hitting a low in mid-2013. Employment has now reached its highest level since the introduction of the euro. The unemployment rate continues to decline and now stands at close to a nine-year low of 8.7%, down by 3.3 percentage points from its highest level. As more people find jobs, household incomes rise. This has helped to strengthen private consumption growth, which in turn is boosting business investment. In addition, a number of other factors have supported investment. These factors include higher demand for euro area exports, rising corporate profitability and an increasing use of installed productive capacity. These positive developments have been fostered and reinforced by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, which have eased funding conditions for households and firms. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular have benefited from our policy measures. The growing inclusiveness of this economic expansion is partly due to the renewed vigour of small businesses, which are a key engine of income creation in our economy.  While our confidence that inflation will converge towards our aim of below, but close to, 2% has strengthened, we cannot yet declare victory on this front.   After increasing to 2% in early 2017 due to a rise in energy prices, headline inflation has fluctuated since May 2017 between 1.3% and 1.5%. Measures of underlying inflation, which exclude the most volatile components, remained subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Also, new headwinds have arisen from the recent volatility in the exchange rate, whose implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability require close monitoring.  On the back of improved economic conditions, the financial stability situation in the euro area has also continued to evolve positively. As I will explain in more detail, for the time being we have little indication that generalised imbalances are emerging. Overall, while we can be more confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still warranted for underlying inflation pressures to build up and inflation to converge durably towards our objective. That is why – at our last meeting – we re-affirmed the decisions taken at our October monetary policy meeting last year. Accordingly, our net asset purchase programme, running at a monthly pace of €30 billion, will continue until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. In parallel, we will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the expanded asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of those purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. We expect our key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.  Looking forward, we remain fully committed to our price stability objective and – in line with our monetary policy strategy – we aim to stabilise inflation around levels that are below, but close to, 2% within a meaningful medium-term horizon. As always, our monetary policy will continue to be guided by our assessment of the progress made towards our objective. Our forward guidance continues to provide a stable framework for our monetary policy stance and its outlook. In line with that guidance, monetary policy will evolve in a fully data-dependent and time-consistent manner. Strengthening the resilience of the euro area financial sector  Your draft resolution also considers several aspects related to the euro area financial sector and I would like to follow up on some of them. Let me first of all emphasise that our monetary policy and a healthier financial sector are mutually reinforcing.  By supporting the economic recovery, our monetary policy measures have had a positive impact on the credit quality of banks’ loans to businesses and households, and helped banks to further reduce their provisioning costs. Moreover, a stronger economy generates greater volumes of sustainable bank lending. Both factors have therefore strengthened the solidity of the European banking sector.  A better integrated and sounder financial sector has also been able to transmit our policy impulses more evenly across the euro area. The improved health of the banking sector, coupled with our credit easing measures, has brought about a marked improvement in the transmission process, as shown by the reduced heterogeneity of bank lending rates across countries and improved borrowing conditions for SMEs.[1]   A more robust financial sector has also allowed us to pursue an accommodative policy for as long as necessary, without any build-up of significant financial stability risks.  The draft resolution points in particular to the risks stemming from possible asset bubbles. We are closely monitoring developments in some market segments, such as prime commercial real estate and housing markets in some countries, and corporate bond markets for lower-rated issuers. As we explain in our Financial Stability Review,[2] asset price increases in euro area markets have so far not been accompanied by excessive credit growth. Although credit flows have been recovering, growth rates are still far below anything we saw before the crisis and on the low side of the range of growth rates historically seen during recoveries. So there is no evidence of systemic credit-fuelled bubbles. The efforts we have made in recent years to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision, above all with the establishment of the banking union, have certainly played a role in protecting financial stability.  In particular, the ECB Banking Supervision plays a key role in ensuring the safety and soundness of banks. It enhances the banks’ resilience through strengthened prudential regulation. It also fosters cross-border financial integration and provides a level playing field by harmonising supervision across the euro area.  Also on the macroprudential side, we see national authorities in close cooperation with the ECB being very active in further mitigating the emergence of possible systemic risks, especially with respect to residential real estate developments.  Despite the improved cyclical environment, improved market sentiment and the substantial strengthening of its shock absorption capacity, the European banking sector continues to face structural challenges, as you also state in your resolution.  Indeed, overcapacity and cost inefficiencies continue to weigh on bank profitability in certain banking markets.  Moreover, the high stock of non-performing loans\\xa0(NPLs) needs to be further reduced and any future build-up needs to be avoided. NPL levels have been declining for more than three years and good progress has been made on the EU Council Action Plan, although there is still a considerable way to go. Additional efforts by banks, supervisors, regulators and legislators are needed to create an environment in which NPLs can be effectively managed and efficiently disposed of.  Strengthening the resilience of the euro area financial sector also means adapting to a changing operating environment.  The resolution mentions, for instance, the growing role of fintech companies. This means more competition for banks, including in the field of lending and payment services. At the same time, new technology presents an opportunity for banks to increase the value added and the cost-efficiency of their services.  Another factor shaping the euro area financial sector is the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU. At this stage, we do not have clarity regarding the shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Well-managed preparations are thus essential for dealing with frictions in the transition from the current situation to the eventual new equilibrium especially in the event that no transitional agreement is reached between the EU and the UK. Banks and financial institutions are not the only ones that have to prepare for an operating environment in a state of flux. Policymakers too, at national and European level, have to make sure that the regulatory framework is fit and ready to safeguard the resilience of the financial sector in the face of the new challenges.  Let me mention two examples.  First, finalising the banking reform package is crucial. The package will strengthen the regulatory architecture, reduce risks in the banking sector and increase financial stability. It will introduce into Union law new internationally agreed standards, such as the leverage ratio requirement, which will restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking system, and the standard on total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), which will strengthen the resolution framework. As co-legislators, you play a vital role in this process. I would encourage you to aim for a consistent implementation of the internationally agreed standards, so as to ensure a level playing field worldwide and to reduce options and national discretions as far as possible.  Second, it is important to complete the architecture of the banking union by putting in place the agreed common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and by establishing a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). These are two fundamental pieces of the banking union project and their implementation should not be postponed further. The backstop should ensure that sufficient funding is available at all times to guarantee orderly resolutions. A fully fledged EDIS is an indispensable counterpart to the single currency as everyone in the euro area should be able to have confidence that the money in their bank account enjoys the same level of protection, regardless of where the account is held within the euro area.  Conclusion Let me conclude. We pay close attention to the European Parliament’s resolution on our Annual Report. And we will respond in detail to the issues you raise there when we publish our ECB Annual Report for 2017. The strong relationship between the ECB and the Parliament not only demonstrates the importance of accountability, but it also bears possible lessons for the reflection on the future of EMU whose strengthening should remain a priority.  A well-designed and effective policy framework requires a clear institutional architecture, measurable objectives and the tools to achieve them. And it needs to be accompanied by strong accountability. This is essential not only to ensure that policies are effective. It is also crucial if the public is to understand those policies and play an active role, in particular via their representatives in Parliament.  Thank you for your attention. I am at your disposal for questions. Closing remarks Mr\\xa0Vice-President, let me first thank Mr\\xa0Fernández and his colleagues for the report. It is very encouraging for our work that you stress how our measures have contributed to the recovery and to financial stability. You noted in the report that the institutional framework enshrined in the Treaties allowed us to take decisive action in line with our price stability mandate, and this has been the objective of our monetary policy throughout. It still is the objective of our monetary policy. In the course of exchanges we are often told that our monetary policy affects one category or another, but our objective is price stability, defined as an inflation rate which is close to, but below, 2% for the whole of the euro area, not necessarily for one specific country. That is how our monetary policy should be judged: whether in the medium term we reach this objective. I would like to thank Commission Vice‑President\\xa0Dombrovskis, and all of you, for this very relevant and useful debate. The debate shows that, while we are now seeing the positive results of our policies, we should not be complacent, but should rather strive for continued improvement. I apologise in advance that, given the short time I have, I cannot comment on each and every statement, but let me touch on some of the issues that you raised. One issue raised by several honourable Members concerns the effects that our monetary policy has on the distribution of income and wealth. So let me say a few words about the effects of quantitative easing (QE). It is quite clear that QE raises asset prices. The holders of assets are generally wealthy institutions or wealthy people, so in the short run you have a worsening of distribution. At the same time, to the extent that QE is successful, it increases employment – as I have said, and I am going to say it again – and it is by far the most powerful measure for decreasing inequality in any economic system. From this viewpoint, even though in the short run one has some negative consequences, in the medium and long term the positive consequences outweigh, very consistently and significantly, any short-term negative concerns. This has been shown, by the way, in several studies. The best way to decrease inequality is to increase employment, and that is what we have done, contributing to increasing employment by 7.5\\xa0million jobs over three-and-a-half years. When we look at wage growth – and that is very important for us because it is, in a sense, what tells us whether inflation is moving towards our objective in the medium term – annual growth in terms of compensation per employee increased has gradually from 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016 to 1.7% now. It is still below its historical average, which is 2.1%, so we have to be more patient, but looking at what happens in other jurisdictions – for example the United States which is, by the way, far advanced in the business cycle – we see that wage growth picks up in the end. The recent data in the USA show exactly this. We have to be aware that we have weak productivity growth, ongoing impacts of labour market reforms implemented in some countries during the crisis and certainly a much bigger labour supply coming from stronger migration flows and higher participation rates. Participation rates of women and older people especially have increased considerably. Also, the low-inflation environment that has prevailed for a long time is now influencing current negotiations. And, by the way, one thing that is quite important in explaining this light response by wages is that even though we had a significant increase in employment, when we go and look at the quality of this increase in employment we see a lot of part-time and temporary arrangements. I am listing all these factors, because they are explanations of why the nominal wage-growth response is going to be lower than we had expected. But we know by looking at other jurisdictions which had, by and large, the same problems that, in the end, nominal wages are going to go up, and they are going up, albeit at a subdued rate. As regards the effects of our monetary policy, some speakers questioned the effectiveness of this policy. We have estimated that our measures have made a substantial impact on the economic performance of the euro area. Considering all the measures taken between 2014 (and even before, in 2013) and October 2017, the overall impact on EU area real GDP growth is 1.9%: 1.9 percentage points over three years. One Member pointed out that investment is still low. We are coming from very, very low levels of private investment but, if anything, over the past three or four quarters, private investment has picked up and it is actually increasing at a much more satisfactory rate than in the past. Since the end of May 2014, lending rates for households and non-financial firms have declined significantly. There is one thing I said in the introductory statement which is very important: during the crisis we observed widely differing lending rates by banks in different parts of the euro area, but this difference has now shrunk and rates are very close nowadays, as are growth rates, by the way. One measure we often look at to determine the strength of the growth process and expansion is how different the growth rates are in different parts of the euro area. Well, the degree of difference now is something like we had in 1995‑1996. In other words, it is a historical low. All countries nowadays are growing. By the way, some Members questioned the effectiveness of our monetary policy for SMEs but, in fact, the lending conditions for SMEs have improved significantly across all sectors and countries. The gradual recovery in loan growth is continuing. The recovery started about four years ago and then really picked up, and it is continuing, though we are not seeing anything like we had before the crisis. So growth rates in lending are good, but nothing euphoric like we saw before the crisis. One point that was made was that we are focused on buying southern countries’ bonds. That is not true. We do not favour certain countries over others in the implementation of our programme. Our purchases are guided by the ECB’s capital key, which takes into account GDP and population. But if one focuses on purchases at specific points in time, for example on 2017 only, this is bound to yield wrong interpretations. The overall stock of euro system holdings is the relevant metric for any assessment of the programme, and not the recent purchase flows. So, in fact, if you look at the stock, you will see that, as far as German bonds are concerned, we are above the capital key for that country. By and large, one should consider the design of the programme: it is flexible and the distribution of actual purchases on any given day often deviates from the ECB capital key. But just consider: this was in the original design of the programme when we had countries like Greece, whose bonds we did not purchase. Of course, then, we had to deviate from the capital key. Some other observations concerned the side effects of our monetary policy. I just wish to reiterate that our measures are proving effective but, at the same time, we are aware of potential side effects and we have to differentiate between the various ways in which they affect economic actors. For example, for individual savers, an accommodative monetary policy means that they accrue fewer nominal returns on their savings. However, such a policy also supports economic expansion and this bolsters employment, income, returns on investment and tax revenues. It therefore benefits households in their capacity as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, borrowers and taxpayers. There is no one specific country that has benefited most from our monetary policy. Everybody has benefited. Public sectors in all countries saved billions on interest rate payments; private sectors across countries and sectors saved billions on interest rate payments to banks; and purchasers of houses could have access to mortgages with much lower interest rates than at any time in the past. This has not only boosted the construction industry but has also boosted investment for the purchase of houses. So we see benefits accruing right across society and not specifically located in one country. When the monetary policy is successful, both creditors and borrowers benefit from it. Similarly, let me continue now on savers. There are several channels through which our policies affect pension and insurance schemes. Beyond the effect on the liability side, it is important to see what happens on the asset side. Our monetary policy has had a beneficial impact on this side of the equation, as the value of the investment portfolio has increased. But, having said that, I completely agree there is a need to put pension systems on a stable path because the survival of any single country’s pension system cannot be dependent only on the proper configuration of interest rates. It must be actuarially sensible. I have already addressed, in my introductory remarks, the issue of possible asset bubbles currently being formed in the euro area. For the time being, we have little indication that generalised financial imbalances are emerging. There are no signs of general asset-price misalignments in the euro area but some segments do need close monitoring and one of them is the prime commercial real-estate market, where we actually see stretched valuations. Also, in some large cities and in some countries real-estate prices have increased at a faster pace than household incomes. This certainly requires monitoring.  Finally, yields in the euro area corporate bond markets, especially for some of the lower-rated issues, have started to look exceptionally low by historical standards, but what are we going to do? Are we going to change monetary policy because of these side effects which are not, by the way, systemic? No, the answer is to enact macro-prudential policies which are the best tool for tackling these challenges – also given their country-specific and sector-specific remits. In late 2016, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued a set of country-specific warnings on medium-term vulnerability in the EU residential real-estate sector.  Now a word about Brexit. We are not party to these negotiations but we are certainly monitoring their evolution and, clearly, I agree that much depends on these negotiations and possible arrangements. Of course we always prepare for any eventuality and, at the same time, we are assessing the direction, the probability and the potential impact of risk, but the bottom line is that either this transition is well managed and there will not be substantial risks, or it is not, and the risks will be there. We are certainly looking at that and we have to be prepared for that. Let me also add that, as far as our role as supervisors is concerned, our good cooperation with the Bank of England is important in coping with the potential risks, and especially the risks of any cliff-edge effects. Certainly, transitional arrangements along the lines of the December European Council guidelines could be useful to smooth out the Brexit process but, as we all know, the materialisation of the transition period is still exposed to political uncertainty, and that will remain for some time to come. On financial supervision, I welcome the review of the European system of financial supervision, including changes to the European supervisory authorities. Some of your comments touched upon the issue of transparency. Here, let me reiterate that we are in complete agreement about the importance of ECB transparency vis-à-vis the European public. We have continuously assessed where we need to further strengthen our transparency framework, and we have demonstrated our commitment, improving our framework as necessary. Just briefly, let me list a few of the actions we have taken. The accounts of Governing Council discussions are now published four weeks after each monetary policymaking meeting. There was none of that a few years ago. Since 2015, the Executive Board members, as well as the Chair of the Supervisory Board, publish their diaries covering professional meetings with external parties. None of that was in place until a few years ago. And in 2016 we decided to disclose the agreement on net financial assets (ANFA). Last year we also published the text of the emergency liquidity assistance agreement. We have announced transparency in relation to our purchase programme, especially transparency on the corporate sector purchase programme. Some of you made reference to the European Ombudsman’s recommendations on the interaction of members of the ECB decision-making bodies, including myself, with the Group of 30 (G30). We have certainly taken note of the Ombudsman’s letter and we will respond in time, but let us remember that the European Ombudsman has already concluded that the ECB must conduct dialogue with market participants and that there is no evidence that the G30 meeting could have directly influenced, or have had an adverse impact on, the ECB’s supervisory tasks. The Ombudsman has also confirmed that the ECB has a robust system of safeguards in place to manage its contacts with the financial sector. Again on transparency, we publish on our website extensive documentation on all these interactions with markets. We disclose agendas and summaries of the discussions, so I can assure you that the ECB is, and remains, committed to reviewing, adjusting and updating our transparency framework. One or two speakers touched on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let me first say that we are not observing a systemically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions – by banks, in other words. Actually, the credit institutions established in the European Union are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like Bitcoin, notwithstanding the high level of public interest. However, recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures contracts by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin, and therefore we will certainly look at that. However, we should understand that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are in the unregulated space and should be regarded as very risky assets. Virtual currencies are subject to high volatility and their prices are entirely speculative. Banks should measure the risk of any holdings of digital currencies in their portfolio accordingly. Right now, digital currencies are not subject to a specific supervisory approach. Work is under way in the Single Supervisory Mechanism to identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutions. There were some other specific points. We are going to consider the possibility of having a Charlemagne commemorative coin. On monetary financing in Hungary, we will assess the existence of monetary financing in our report. As you know, the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament, but members of its Executive Board, myself included, have accepted invitations to discuss our monetary policy generally and broadly in national parliaments, so I would be glad to accept an invitation from the Irish Parliament if I were to receive it. I think I have gone through most of your questions. Thank you.      [1] The difference between interest rates for loans to non-financial corporations of above and below €1 million also continued to decline, indicating easier access to finance for SMEs, in particular in the countries that were most affected by the financial crisis.

      "['2018-02-02', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'The euro area’s three lines of defence', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference “Deepening of EMU”, Ljubljana, 2 February 2018', '  The euro area’s three lines of defence   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference “Deepening of EMU”, Ljubljana, 2 February 2018 For a long time, the European Central Bank has been at the forefront of macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area. There’s broad agreement that without our unprecedented actions, the euro area would have fared far worse. Even more people would have lost their jobs, and wages and prices would have stagnated for much longer, or would even have fallen. Although our actions were bold and unparalleled, we acted within our mandate, as confirmed by the European Court of Justice.  The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, and the progress made in setting up a banking union, have fixed some of the shortcomings in euro area governance and instruments. These steps were important in easing the pressure the crisis has put on the ECB. But many of the institutional failings that caused and perpetuated the crisis remain unresolved. Incentives to pursue sound policies remain too weak and stabilisation of shocks too difficult. These are deep-rooted issues that cannot be resolved by a few years of above-trend growth. To assume that the current economic expansion will heal all wounds is naive. The euro area needs reform.  As the central bank of the euro area, the ECB should not interfere in the details of what is mostly a political debate. But we have a stake in the success of the current discussion. Without further reforms, the next crisis may well force the ECB to test the limits of its mandate. Depending on the nature of the next crisis, policy action might require taking short-term rates much deeper into negative territory. Or it might require purchases of assets that are riskier than public or corporate debt. Or it may draw us dangerously close to monetary financing of governments. As things stand today, and given member states’ still limited fiscal policy space, even a small downturn could create large economic and social costs. It could, once again, test the cohesiveness of the currency union. Unless the euro area finds a way to change direction, to reform itself and to regain space for active macroeconomic policy, the same fractures we saw in 2012 could reappear and widen when the next downturn comes. Many ideas for reforms are being floated, of course. Some are bolder than others. The recent proposals by German and French economists are a worthwhile attempt to bridge differences and surmount trade-offs. Today I will not offer another blueprint. What I will offer instead are requirements than any euro area reform will have to pass. I will call them the three “lines of defence” that any well-functioning monetary union depends on. They are needed to deliver a stable currency. They are needed to protect the ECB and its mandate. And they are needed to keep belief in the future of the euro strong.  Flexible markets form the first line of defence.  They are indispensable for a currency union. They reduce the need for macroeconomic stabilisation and curb contentious debates about crisis management. Markets that can absorb shocks efficiently do not waste costly political capital. And they create more policy space in downturns, for both fiscal and monetary policy. To bolster the first line, the way we implement economic policies needs to change. The current system has clearly not delivered its intended benefits. Take the European Commission’s country-specific recommendations as an example. In 2016, less than 5% of the recommendations were implemented by Member States. Limited enforcement of the recommendations, rather than the incorrect identification of the main issues, has made the existing framework fail.  Why? Because recommendations from outside a country, even if correct on substance, are typically dismissed. Sovereign governments don’t accept what they see as diktats from Brussels. Economists should have known better. Incentives are the drivers of our actions. So, if outside recommendations are perceived as being politically too costly, then we need to find solutions that promote national “ownership” of reform efforts. Money is not the answer. It is political incentives that need resolve. The other key domain to spur the catalyst function of our market economies is the Single Market. It is incomplete as we all know. Take services as an example. They account for over 70% of the EU’s GDP and an equal share of its employment. But we still face significant barriers when it comes to cross-border service provision in the EU. The Services Package that was adopted about a year ago was a step in the right direction but more needs to be done. Efficient and integrated financial markets are part of the first line of defence. In the United States, around 60% of a shock to a state’s GDP is cushioned by financial markets. In the euro area, the share is currently closer to 20%. Country-specific shocks remain unsmoothed to a large extent, mainly because cross-border equity risk-sharing is hugely underdeveloped in Europe. A true capital markets union could significantly help to diversify and reduce risk. It would thereby limit the financial burden to be levied by governments in the case of adverse shocks. And it would broaden the scope of monetary policy transmission beyond the banking sector, making policy less vulnerable. Finally, to avert banking collapses, governments in the past were forced to disburse large sums of public money in the pursuit of economic and financial stability. Completing banking union will reduce risks for taxpayers and break the remaining link between banks and national governments. A European deposit insurance scheme is a precondition for a truly integrated banking system and single money. Let us not forget that 86% of our money is created by commercial banks. The transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy will always be incomplete as long as differences in depositor confidence prevail across the euro area. The second line of defence relates to the role of governments.  Even the most flexible and efficient markets cannot fully absorb very large shocks without imposing economic hardship on a considerable number of people. In other words, flexible markets come at a price. They increase uncertainty for employees and often require relinquishment.  Uncertainty, for example, is born of the fear of a loss of employment or of not being able to respond to today’s fast pace of change. But it is also born of the fear that governments themselves have been pushed to the sidelines as globalisation has proceeded. Recent election outcomes around the world bear witness to this fear. The more exposed individuals are, the more likely a political backlash.  Governments can mitigate these effects. Unlike the United States, however, the European Union is not a federation. This means that, as a rule, stabilisation and the provision of security in the form of social services takes place first at national level. Keeping governments solvent is a precondition for achieving that. As we saw during the crisis, if perceptions of sustainability among markets decline, then counter-cyclical spending can quickly become constrained. So we need to regain fiscal space, which means building adequate national fiscal buffers.  The current broad-based economic expansion is contributing a lot to this end. But many countries are emerging from the crisis still bearing legacy burdens that could take decades to resolve. This leaves us vulnerable to divergence and fragmentation when a crisis strikes – and in some ways, even more so than before. Fiscal consolidation therefore needs to go hand in hand with efforts strengthening our area-wide defences. Of course, the ESM is already an important safeguard. But we need to enhance its competences in the field of crisis management and make it more agile. This includes making full use of its existing instruments, such as the direct bank recapitalisation tool and precautionary financial assistance, and moving away from the unanimity requirement. And in the long run, it means bringing the ESM into the community framework. The stability of the euro area cannot be in the hands of one, or a few, Member States and their parliaments. Ultimately, the ESM needs to be accountable to the people of Europe. But union stabilisation cannot stop with the ESM. The euro area needs a fiscal instrument that can help it cope with large shocks without having to rely excessively on the ECB.  Such an instrument would be the third line of defence of our monetary union.  It would support aggregate demand in countries experiencing a crisis, drawing on common funds. It would thereby provide an additional layer of stabilisation that safeguards trust in national policies. EU solidarity would then take on a whole new meaning. Whether such an instrument would directly support national safety nets, or would instead undertake investment projects that create jobs and income, will be subject to much debate. Whether it should be balanced by stronger market discipline will be even more heatedly debated.  These discussions will take time. However important, they should not obscure what should be governments’ urgent priority: strengthening the first two lines of defence of our monetary union. Achieving lasting economic stability must involve finding a balance of discipline and flexibility in our economies. This will both strengthen support for the euro and help alleviate the pressure and burden on the ECB in crisis times. Realpolitik will dictate the speed of reforms. What we do need is broad agreement that they will be built on these three lines of defence, and visible progress on the first two. Thank you.   ']\n",
      "['2018-02-01', 'Peter Praet', 'Economic developments in the euro area', 'Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Cercle de Lorraine, Brussels, 1 February 2018', '  Economic developments in the euro area   Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Cercle de Lorraine, Brussels, 1 February 2018 The robust pace of economic expansion clearly shows that our monetary policy has been effective in preparing for a return of inflation to a rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Inflation developments remain subdued, however, and we are still some distance away from meeting the Governing Council’s criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term[1]. The euro area economic expansion is strong and broad-based. Real GDP in the euro area has expanded for 19 consecutive quarters, growing by 2.7% year on year during the fourth quarter of 2017, according to preliminary data. This compares with the latest potential growth estimates for the euro area of around 1.5%.[2]  The latest economic data and survey results point to continued growth momentum at the end of last year. The composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index – which correlates closely with growth in the euro area – remains above its long-term average and is close to a 12-year high. Moreover, Eurostat’s Economic Sentiment Indicator is around its highest level for 17 years. Forward-looking components of surveys also point to growth in the quarters ahead.  The ongoing recovery has led to solid employment gains. The number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7.5 million since hitting a low in mid-2013. This means that all of the job losses recorded during the crisis have been recovered. Additionally, the unemployment rate is now at its lowest level for around nine years and continues to decline, despite an increase in labour force participation. Employment growth, together with the gradual increase in employee compensation, is supporting households’ disposable income and underpinning solid consumption dynamics. Robust consumer spending is being driven by buoyant sentiment, favourable bank lending conditions and the notable progress achieved with respect to deleveraging. The investment outlook is also positive, supported not only by a need to modernise the capital stock after years of subdued investment and an improving outlook for profitability, but also by easy financing conditions as our policy measures have passed through financial markets, benefiting businesses and their customers.  Since the announcement of our policy measures in June 2014, bank lending rates for euro area non-financial corporations have fallen by around 120 basis points and those for households by around 110 basis points. Rates on very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by around 200 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as these companies provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area. Heterogeneity of lending rates across countries has also fallen sharply. For example, the difference between the average lending rate for firms in countries which were severely affected by the crisis and that in other countries has narrowed by more than 100 basis points over this period. The pass-through of monetary policy has become more even. Banks are also passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers due to the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-II), which further supports these positive developments.[3]  The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, which continues to improve, according to the latest survey results.[4]  Furthermore, bank lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, covering the period from April to September 2017, euro area SMEs have continued to see improvements in the availability of bank loans. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016.  Against the backdrop of this substantial easing of financing conditions, domestic demand has become the mainstay of growth in the euro area, making the recovery more resilient to developments overseas. Meanwhile, real GDP growth is projected to remain above potential growth in the coming years. The acceleration in the cyclical momentum and the ongoing reduction of economic slack strengthen our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%.  But inflation continues to be lacklustre. After lingering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation increased towards the end of 2016 and has fluctuated between 1.3% and 1.5% since May of last year. Annual inflation stood at 1.3% in January, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Muted wage dynamics are one important element keeping a lid on underlying price pressures. These are shaped by many factors. In addition to weak productivity developments, the significant degree of remaining labour market slack is limiting wage growth. When assessing slack, it is important to look also at broader measures than the unemployment rate. The so-called “U6 measure” captures unemployment, underemployment (meaning workers who would like to work more hours) and marginal attachment, which refers to those members of the workforce who are not seeking employment very actively either because, for example, they are not available to start a new job at short notice or have been discouraged by a fruitless search for work. The U6 measure currently covers around 17% of the labour force and is thus considerably higher than the unemployment rate.[5]  Looking forward, although there still appears to be a disconnect between growth and inflation, the ongoing economic expansion is expected to further contribute to a narrowing of the output and unemployment gaps. As slack in the economy continues to be absorbed, price pressures will gradually build up and the traditional Phillips curve relationship between inflation and the business cycle should eventually reassert itself. That being said, current estimates still appear to point to a flatter slope of the Phillips curve than in the past, which could be interpreted as an indication that the relationship between economic slack and inflation has weakened. This weakening might be partly the result of a mismeasurement of slack (because of structural changes in the labour market) or an unstable relationship between slack and inflation over time. At the same time, this effect could also result from discrete parallel shifts in the Phillips curve. Such parallel shifts can arise due to temporary changes in wage and inflation mark-ups or an incipient dis-anchoring of inflation expectations, which is of greater concern to a central bank. Empirically disentangling these factors is extremely difficult, so we need to be mindful of such considerations when discussing the relationship between economic slack and inflation developments. Our primary task as a central bank is to ensure that the traditional relationship between the real and the nominal sides of the economy reasserts itself at a steady-state rate of inflation that is below, but close to, 2%. We have not yet accomplished our mission: with inflation convergence proceeding only gradually, patience and persistence in our monetary policy remain warranted. In the light of this, the Governing Council in January maintained all elements of its accommodative monetary policy stance. Together, our monetary policy measures will preserve the ample degree of accommodation that remains necessary for inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.  Looking ahead, monetary policy will evolve in a data-dependent and time-consistent manner. Once the Governing Council judges that the three criteria for sustained adjustment – convergence, confidence and resilience – have been met, net asset purchases will expire, in line with our guidance. From that point in time, the evolution of inflation will remain conditional on reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net asset purchases. The stock of long-duration assets held in our portfolio will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well beyond the end of our net purchases. Policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net purchases will contribute to holding the short to intermediate portions of the yield curve in check for as long as necessary, thereby ensuring that financial conditions remain consistent with a sustained adjustment of inflation.

      "['2018-01-31', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'What yield curves are telling us', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Financial Times European Financial Forum, “Building a New Future for International Financial Services”, Dublin, 31 January 2018', '  What yield curves are telling us   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Financial Times European Financial Forum, “Building a New Future for International Financial Services”, Dublin, 31 January 2018 Slides from the presentation The US Treasury yield curve flattened considerably last year, reducing the spread between ten-year and two-year US Treasury yields to less than 60 basis points. When Alan Greenspan first referred to a bond market “conundrum” in 2005, the spread was around 80 basis points.[1] In the euro area, by contrast, the term spread remained broadly unchanged last year. At face value, a simple reconciling factor of recent international bond price developments is the tightening cycle that has gained traction in the United States. It is well known that a rise in policy rates typically leads to a flattening of the sovereign yield curve as long-term rates tend to increase by less than short-term rates.  In my remarks this morning I will try to shed some more light on the potential factors currently affecting long-term rates. I will argue that, in and of itself, policy normalisation in the US cannot fully explain the pronounced flattening of the US Treasury curve. I will argue instead that two factors are likely to weigh on long-term yields in the US – and, in part, also on the yields in other advanced economies, including the euro area – which are fairly global in their nature and origin, namely cross-border capital flows and a depressed inflation risk premium.  The implications for policymakers are twofold. First, unlike in 2005, international capital flows mainly reflect portfolio rebalancing efforts by private investors and are less the result of interventions by official institutions.[2] This suggests that, while the present episode shares some similarities with Greenspan’s bond conundrum, changes in bond prices are likely to be driven by more price-sensitive investors this time around.  Second, because the decline in long-term inflation swap yields in recent years is mainly due to a fall in the inflation risk premium, market-based inflation expectations at these tenors remain well anchored at levels consistent with price stability, both in the US and the euro area. We therefore see no evidence that the long period of low inflation has undermined the credibility of central banks’ inflation aims.  Are current yield curves signalling recession risks? Let me set the scene with a snapshot of the recent trend in the slope of the US Treasury and the German Bund curves.  You can see this on my first slide, measured as the simple difference between ten-year and two-year yields. You can see the marked flattening of the Treasury curve last year which has only recently come to a halt. The US yield curve is currently at its flattest level for more than ten years, with ten-year Treasuries yielding just about 60 basis points more than two-year bonds. At the start of 2017, the difference was around 130 basis points.  You can also see that the German Bund curve is currently about twice as steep as the US Treasury curve and has remained relatively stable, with ten-year bonds over most of the time yielding around 100 basis points more than two-year bonds – not very far from the average observed over the past 20 years.  My second slide focuses on the US Treasury curve. What you can see here is the ten-year yield and a model-based breakdown of the yield into its two main components: the average of the current and expected future short-term interest rates over the maturity of the bond and the term premium. All series are shown as cumulative changes since the start of last year. Two facts can be drawn from this chart. The first is that the recent marked flattening of the curve reflects what markets call a “bear flattening” – that is, short-term rates have been rising faster than long-term rates. This is evident from the fact that the ten-year yield – the blue solid line – today is about the same as it was a year ago. Short-term interest rates, meanwhile, have risen by around 90 basis points. At face value, this would suggest that the repricing of interest rate expectations at the short end of the US curve has not been passed through to long-term rates. This interpretation is incorrect, however.  Indeed, and this is my second point, the broad stability of the ten-year yield masks two sharply diverging developments: a marked fall in the term premium – the yellow area – and an appreciable repricing by markets of the expected future path of short-term interest rates – the dark orange area. You can see this clearly on the slide. Put simply, if it weren’t for the parallel fall in the term premium, ten-year Treasuries would trade some 50 basis points above their January 2017 levels and we wouldn’t be having a discussion about flattening. US long-term yields have resisted upward pressure only because of a considerable re-compression of the term premium. Only shortly after the UK’s referendum on EU membership in summer 2016 was the US ten-year term premium more negative than it is today. This allows for one preliminary conclusion but begs one question.  The conclusion is that markets seem sanguine about the prospects for the US, and probably also for the global, economy. Judging from the average expected short-term rate over the next ten years, the markets appear to have shaken off some of the pessimism that caused them to tread very carefully over the past few years.  Past and currently expected policy rate changes are predicted to last. This also means that the flattening of the US yield curve is unlikely to signal a looming recession, as it may have done in previous business cycles.  The question, then, is what has caused the US term premium to fall to such an extent since the start of last year. In answering this question, I will distinguish between two broad factors. The first relates to international portfolio rebalancing considerations and the second to investors’ views of the risks surrounding the medium to long-term inflation outlook. International capital flows and long-term yields  I have already examined the first factor in other speeches.[3] Today I would like to shed some more light on the direction and extent of cross-border spillovers that might currently contribute to keeping long-term yields compressed.  To recall, from mid-2014 onwards we observed a striking turnaround in capital flows in the euro area from net inflows to net outflows, just when the ECB had announced its first credit easing package and when expectations were gradually growing among market participants that we would also soon begin purchasing government bonds. You can see this on my next slide.  Since then, capital outflows have remained substantial, peaking at nearly 5% of euro area GDP. What has happened is that bond investors, both inside and outside the euro area, have rebalanced their portfolios, moving out of euro area debt securities and into the closest substitutes – bonds issued by the safest sovereigns outside the euro area. And within that asset class, most market participants have rebalanced their portfolios towards US Treasuries and government agency bonds. This confirms that the portfolio rebalancing channel has been instrumental in delivering the intended benefits of our quantitative easing. Slide 4 shows the extent of this rebalancing more clearly. Since the start of our asset purchase programme (APP), euro area investors alone accounted for more than half of foreign purchases of US debt securities. History suggests that these shares are highly unusual for the euro area. Only recently has the share started to decline again. Now, according to conventional models of the term structure, such capital flows should play no direct role in determining yields.[4] In these models, the term premium reflects the covariance between expected bond returns and the representative investor’s stochastic discount factor. However, the conditions under which the supply of and demand for bonds are entirely neutral on yields are very restrictive and unlikely to hold in practice. Indeed, it is now widely accepted that arbitrageurs are often risk-averse and that many investors have so-called preferred habitats for certain assets or segments of the yield curve.[5] Pension funds, for example, typically need to invest a significant portion of their assets in safe long-dated bonds to match the liability side of their balance sheet. With arbitrageurs capital-constrained, changes in the demand from preferred habitat investors can then affect the price of duration risk and hence term premia. The effectiveness of central bank asset purchase programmes rests on this critical assumption.[6]  It is now easy to see that these programmes can trigger substantial cross-border capital flows and that these are likely to affect the term premia of assets in the receiving economy. As a result, returns on US Treasuries, German Bunds and Japanese government bonds, given their close similarities in terms of safety and liquidity characteristics, are often driven by a common component as investors attempt to equalise their risk-adjusted returns.  Slide 5 illustrates this mechanism through the lens of a Japanese investor. It shows the evolution of the return on a ten-year Bund and equivalent US Treasury on an exchange rate-hedged basis. You can see that, in recent years, a Japanese investor in US Treasuries would have been able to lock in a significant yield pick-up over a domestic government bond, and at times also over a German Bund without incurring exchange rate risk. Only recently has it become more attractive for a Japanese investor to invest in German Bunds, reflecting the increased cost of hedging resulting from the rise in US short-term yields. Empirical analysis on the direction of international spillovers in bond markets corroborates this view. On slide 6 you can see that ECB researchers, using the Diebold-Yilmaz methodology, find that bond market spillovers from the euro area to the United States spiked sharply by mid-2014, just when capital flows started to turn. According to this methodology, spillovers from the euro area accounted for around half the variance in US Treasuries for most of 2015. And these spillovers have been regaining momentum since mid-2017. Strong correlation between international asset prices therefore doesn’t necessarily result from a common shock. Indeed, in the light of the strong idiosyncratic forces that have increasingly driven a wedge between the monetary policy cycles of advanced economies in recent years, portfolio rebalancing by private investors due to domestic shocks is likely to have increased over time.  A dominant chase for yield by private investors, in turn, also distinguishes the current situation from that in 2005 and 2006, which was the last time global yield curves were unusually flat. Back then, purchases by foreign official institutions – themselves often reflecting large current account surpluses in certain parts of the world – coincided to drive down long-term yields in the United States, whereas official investors have been net sellers of US long-term Treasuries over the past couple of years. You can see this clearly on my next slide. To the extent that private capital flows are more volatile, the ECB’s November 2017 Financial Stability Review noted the risk of a sudden repricing in fixed income markets should investors decide to rebalance their portfolios. Low inflation risk and bond term premia This brings me to my second factor.  One feature that may cause global investors to rebalance their portfolios in the future is a reappraisal of the prevailing outlook for inflation and, hence, for monetary policy across advanced economies. Such a reappraisal may occur as we are currently observing that the long period of very low global inflation may have affected investors’ deep-seated beliefs about the future. This is most visible when looking at current levels of long-term inflation risk premia in both the United States and the euro area.  You can see this on my next slide. Here we have a decomposition of long-term inflation-linked bonds and swaps into the same two components that I showed for nominal bonds on my second slide, namely expected future inflation and an inflation risk premium. The interpretation is identical: just as investors demand a premium for interest rate uncertainty, they also demand a premium for the uncertainty around the expected future inflation rate. And while in the past this premium tended to be positive on average – even during the most turbulent times of the great financial crisis – it fell sharply in 2014 and is still in negative territory in the United States today. In other words, investors are willing to pay a higher price for nominal bonds because they value them as a hedge against low inflation. So, this slide conveys two messages. The first is that markets do not question the credibility or ability of central banks to steer the economy towards their inflation aims. Medium-term inflation expectations per se have remained firmly anchored around levels consistent with price stability. This is in line with our reading of survey-based inflation expectations. The second message is that markets are, however, deeply sceptical that inflation can surprise much on the upside in the future. This is corroborated by survey-based measures, which show that, since the financial crisis, survey participants have been more concerned about deviations in the direction of lower inflation and less concerned about deviations in the direction of higher inflation.[7]  Another way of looking at this is to consider the option-implied distribution of average inflation over the next five years. You can see this on my next slide in the case of the euro area. Although this distribution reflects expectations over a nearer horizon, it re-emphasises the point that investors assign only a small probability for inflation to surprise much to the upside. But it also demonstrates convincingly that markets have by and large priced out deflationary risks in the euro area. As you can see, when we announced the APP in January 2015 these risks were considered to be very different.  I see two main factors that may help explain why investors and professional forecasters are currently casting doubt on positive inflation risks.  The first is related to how we form our beliefs, opinions and attitudes.[8] Specifically, the peculiar economic cycle that followed the global financial crisis – where very low interest rates around the world succeeded in reducing economic slack and in inflating the value of some assets, but not the prices of goods and services – may have made investors doubt the recurrence of upside inflation risk. And this may have led to a downward migration of the future inflation risk distribution.  This means that large shocks can push the economy into a previously unknown state – in our case a low inflation state – where the absence of, or break with, past regularities, such as the relationship between slack and inflation, may imply a long transition phase to a new steady state.[9] Worse, if the beliefs I just mentioned guide our actions, then low growth or low inflation can be the result of self-fulfilling pessimistic expectations and can lead to so-called “stagnation traps”.[10]  The second, related, factor is that the nature of the uncertainties we face today may have changed compared with the pre-crisis period. For example, Barbara Rossi and co-authors find that while risk fell sharply after the great financial crisis, Knightian uncertainty – situations in which people might be unable to assign correct probabilities to future outcomes – remained persistently high even after the end of the crisis.[11] In these cases, investors still have to make a decision, and judgement – often based on current observables – is usually the only basis they have. Whatever the ultimate reasons, does it matter if the inflation risk premium is low? There are two sides to the discussion. From a monetary policy perspective, what matters most is that inflation expectations remain at levels consistent with price stability. At the margin, a low inflation risk premium is positive as it signals increased confidence in the central bank’s ability to achieve its inflation aim. But from a financial stability perspective, and here I again refer to previous work presented in the ECB’s Financial Stability Review, a low inflation risk premium may be a matter of concern if it indicates complacency about future adjustments.[12] In this case, a reappraisal of investors’ view about future risks to global inflation may cause a correction of global risk premia, in particular in an environment of historically low volatility, as you can see on my next slide.  Oil prices may be a potential catalyst. ECB internal research finds that energy price shocks have become considerably more persistent lately, which could fool investors into believing that they are bound to stay at current moderate levels in the foreseeable future. Incidentally, as oil prices moved higher in recent weeks, the inflation risk premia also rose amid an increasing willingness on the part of investors to hedge against inflation in an environment of strongly declining deflation probabilities.  This is also consistent with survey-based evidence. For example, a recent survey of 62 fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch revealed that a rise in inflation is thought to be the most underestimated tail risk for global financial markets in 2018. One fund manager in two considers a rise in inflation as a risk to current market prices. Now, whether or not this risk is real, or how much we should worry about it, is an entirely different question. I will pass no judgment on the US. In the euro area, however, we see no such inflation tail risks at the current juncture. Inflation is expected to converge only very gradually to levels closer to 2%. For this reason, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up, and we expect the ECB’s key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.  At the same time, we currently see no reason to believe that the distribution of future inflation risks has moved permanently lower.[13] It is true that it is taking longer than usual for inflationary pressure to emerge. But this is likely to reflect the delayed effects of the double-dip recession rather than structural changes to the economy. Conclusion Let me conclude. Current financial market conditions have given rise to much comment. Concerns have been voiced that low long-term yields are a precursor to economic slowdown or recession. These concerns, however, are inconsistent with the marked rise in expected future short-term rates in some jurisdictions and the parallel increase in stock prices in many others. We currently see no concrete evidence of market uncertainty about the sustainability of the current economic expansion.  We do see evidence, however, suggesting that market participants globally consider upside risks to future inflation to be limited at present. While this might be a natural corollary of the protracted period of low inflation, it may also be a matter of concern if it indicates complacency over future adjustments.  However, we see no such risks in the euro area today. Accordingly, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up, and we expect the ECB’s key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.

Introduction My talk today will focus on the provision of central bank liquidity to entities that are close to or in resolution – a topic that has attracted much public interest. This discussion is taking place in the broader context of the completion of Europe’s banking union. But a single European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), alongside an effective, common backstop for bank resolution, remains one of the missing pieces. While we are not there yet with respect to EDIS and indeed common backstops, the need remains for banks to be able to plan ahead and obtain liquidity, even if determined as failing or likely to fail or once the resolution process is activated.  The question is whether and to what extent this liquidity should be provided by central banks. The ECB’s position on the matter has been constant: the provision of central bank liquidity – be it through monetary policy credit operations or emergency liquidity assistance, should not be automatically assumed in resolution planning. Resolution measures should be financed by contributions from shareholders and creditors of the bank, or by the State or at Union level, but not by central banks. This obviously does not mean that an entity otherwise in compliance with central bank requirements for the provision of liquidity cannot access such liquidity.  2. Guiding principles and different objectives behind the provision of liquidity  Before going into the specifics, it is important to distinguish between the actors providing the liquidity; the objectives for which the liquidity is provided; and the beneficiaries of the liquidity. Starting with the actors, they can be grouped into two categories: on the one hand, the central banks, in the performance of both Eurosystem and national tasks; and, on the other hand, governmental entities and supranational authorities.  If we now look at the first group of actors, the central banks, they have been granted independence from the political instruction of the government. This means that they cannot be instructed to provide liquidity – the provision of liquidity must be their free and independent decision. This applies regardless of whether the central bank provides liquidity in order to pursue the objectives assigned to it by primary law or under domestic legislation to fulfil its lender of last resort function. Moving on to the objectives, liquidity can be provided to serve the primary objective of maintaining price stability. This is without prejudice to supporting national central bank objectives or to ensuring financial stability to which the European System of Central Banks (or the ESCB) only contributes. But it can also be provided as part of other economic or fiscal policies. While the first set of objectives are the responsibilities of Eurosystem central banks, economic and fiscal policy objectives are firmly within the remit of governmental entities. Central banks can exercise powers only within their mandate and therefore provide liquidity for an objective that has been assigned to them by law.  Concerning the beneficiaries, liquidity can be provided to a solvent institution (this is a typical central banking function and therefore of a temporary nature) or to an insolvent institution, also for a longer period (this, by contrast, is a government task) under the scrutiny of competition authorities.  Having said this, I will focus first on liquidity provided by central banks. There are two main sources of overnight central bank liquidity generally available to credit institutions. One is in the form of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. The other is in the form of emergency liquidity assistance or “ELA”. These two sources of liquidity meet different objectives and are provided under different legal frameworks.  Our constitutional mandate requests that we at all times to pursue the Eurosystem’s price stability objective in line with a functioning open market economy. The corollary is the provision of liquidity must ultimately serve the functioning of the real economy. Eurosystem monetary policy has to be provided to an entity that participates in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Participating in monetary policy transmission means in principle channelling liquidity to the real economy. Extending life-lines to institutions outside the monetary policy transmission mechanism is structural or economic policy or financial stability. But if there are financial stability considerations the central bank can only support or participate within its mandate. In addition, the provision of Eurosystem monetary policy liquidity must also comply with other requirements set down by primary law, notably with the requirement that lending is based on adequate collateral and the prohibition of monetary financing. The Eurosystem should be adequately protected against any risks associated with its lending activity. I will come back to this point later. And as I have said, central bank independence also plays an important role in the sense that a central bank cannot be instructed to provide liquidity, even in a crisis. It has to assess the situation of each entity and decide independently. I will make a few remarks on the monetary financing prohibition – an important requirement flowing from the Treaty with which the provision of central bank liquidity (including in resolution) has to comply. Any assessment of liquidity provision against the prohibition of monetary financing requires a careful case-by-case analysis. The ECB has repeatedly stated in its – publicly available – Convergence Reports and in its opinions that financing by central banks, even when granted independently and at their full discretion, of credit institutions other than in connection with their central banking tasks, in particular the support of insolvent credit and/or other financial institutions, is incompatible with the monetary financing prohibition. Financing insolvent institutions is a government task – indeed the ECB has identified criteria to distinguish between government tasks and central banking tasks. The ECB has also repeatedly clarified that while central banks may be involved in administering resolution measures, they should not finance them. National central banks could also administer resolution measures on a genuine agency basis on behalf and for the account of a third party, that is, the government or one of its entities. In this case, however, the central bank would not itself provide liquidity, but simply carry out these tasks like an agent.  It is a primary law requirement that lending can only take place against “adequate collateral”. On the basis of this fundamental requirement, the Eurosystem defines the rules and conditions for collateral to be acceptable, or “adequate”, for monetary policy purposes. This framework is set down by means of various ECB legal acts and instruments (in particular in the General Documentation guideline). Adequate collateral for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy framework means, first, that collateral must fully protect the central bank against losses in credit operations as these losses are in principle, shared. Consequently the Eurosystem is required, under primary law, to act as a secured creditor. In concrete terms this is ensured through pledge or repurchase agreements adequately secured by an asset capable of being appropriated, transferred and/or sold at first notice. A key point here is that a standalone guarantee has never been recognised as adequate collateral under our framework. Guarantees can only play a limited role, namely to make up for the lesser credit quality of a given collateral provided by a financially sound counterparty. In no circumstances would a guarantee “cure” the lack of financial soundness of a given counterparty, or the lack of collateral or a combination of the two, which is often the case in a resolution scenario.  If a public guarantee can prevent insolvency, it is only after having tested its value in the markets. If a public guarantee serves to cut out the markets and replace them with central bank liquidity it would contravene the principle of an open market economy with free competition and could be seen as a circumvention of the monetary financing prohibition.  Indeed it is already questionable to what extent the counterparty is able to fulfil the criterion of financial soundness. Finally, as I just mentioned, it is an important requirement in our framework that collateral can be freely realised and sold at a market price. In the case of a mere guarantee this is not obvious and thereby offers a standard of protection which is legally not comparable to appropriable collateral. If all prudential and regulatory shortcomings could be replaced by a guarantee, it would undermine the whole framework of prudential and monetary intervention and, in the case of public guarantees, the competition principles underlying an open market economy. This is particularly true if a guarantee in rem would be replaced by a blanket guarantee ad personam to a bank. Why then not allow a guarantee for all the banks to maintain financial stability. A cure all guarantee that a central bank must accept is a handover of money creation to the Government at EU or national level. The acceptance of own used government-guaranteed bank bonds in the past was therefore rapidly be curtailed by the Governing Council of the ECB.  Alongside “adequate collateral”, the second important layer of protection against the Eurosystem suffering potential loss is the requirement to interact only with financially sound counterparties.  Without devoting too much time to the technical details, counterparties to Eurosystem credit operations must fulfil certain eligibility criteria. In essence, an entity must not only be a licensed credit institution or a branch but also needs to be financially sound. Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB also allows the provision of liquidity to “ credit institutions and market participants”, for example financial market infrastructures such as central counterparty clearing houses. But I will not reflect on this particular case if not to question that a credit institution in or close to resolution is still participating in the market if it would have the central bank as sole or predominant counterparty. The financial soundness of a given counterparty is assessed by the Eurosystem on an ongoing basis, notably taking into account each entity’s reported capital, liquidity and leverage ratios. The specific eligibility criteria are to be found in our framework and in particular the General Documentation guideline. I should add at this point that, where necessary, the ECB’s Governing Council may also take discretionary measures in individual cases. So, in some justified instances where there are prudential concerns, it may reject certain assets as collateral or the counterparties despite their being eligible.  Let me turn now to the second source of central bank liquidity: emergency liquidity assistance, or ELA.    Emergency liquidity assistance can be provided by national central banks on the basis of their national competences and to pursue national objectives, namely to preserve financial stability when a solvent entity is facing temporary liquidity issues.  The provision of ELA must likewise be backed by sufficient collateral. It must also comply with primary law requirements, such as the prohibition of monetary financing and it should not interfere with the tasks and objectives of the ESCB (in which case the Governing Council can object to it).  I will make only a few more comments on the provision of central bank liquidity. Central banks can only provide liquidity in the context of pursuing their objectives and to carry out the tasks within their mandate. In addition, with regard to the monetary financing prohibition, the ECB has repeatedly stated that the financing of resolution measures is a government task. Does this mean that the Eurosystem would be prevented from providing liquidity in the context of resolution? The answer is, not necessarily, as long as the provision of liquidity complies with the requirements of any of the two sources of central bank liquidity I just described. These requirements are even more strict in the case of monetary policy liquidity than for emergency liquidity assistance. For example, in the case of the asset separation tool, liquidity can be provided to the solvent part of the bank that is participating in monetary policy transmission and not in order to finance the separation itself. Liquidity can be provided under the generally applicable monetary policy rules and respecting the limits set out in the Treaty and any Governing Council decisions. Yet, whilst the provision of central bank liquidity should not be ruled out in resolution, it should not be assumed either.   This is precisely the reason why the Single Resolution Fund was established: financing of resolution (setting aside the case of recent national insolvency proceedings) should no longer come from the taxpayers, but from the banks themselves. The provision of liquidity by the Single Resolution Fund is of key importance in the euro area. But since, for the time being, this source of liquidity is yet to be fully operationalised, the question is where should the backstop come from? I argue that this source cannot come from the central banks, as resolution financing is a government task.  This is nothing new, as the idea that central bank liquidity should not be assumed nor ruled out is laid down in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and has also been underlined by the ECB on a number of occasions.[1]   Let us now turn to the second group of actors providing liquidity in resolution – governmental entities and supranational authorities – and the liquidity provided by the Single Resolution Fund on which I will be relatively brief.  The SRF ensures uniform practice in the financing of resolutions within the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). It also ensures that the financial industry, as a whole, finances the stabilisation of the financial system, as it pools contributions raised at national level from entities within the Single Resolution Board’s remit in each of the 19 Member States in the banking union. SRF support may take the form of guarantees or loans if certain conditions are met and to the extent necessary to ensure the effective application of the resolution tools, within the resolution scheme.  But, as you may know, the SRF is not yet fully funded. It will be gradually built up during its first eight years of existence and should reach the target level of at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions within the banking union by the end of 2023. So it does not have sufficient funding at this stage to provide liquidity on a large scale.  On the other hand, there is the question whether the fund will be sufficient, even in the final stage, in the event of a very big and widespread financial crisis. And if not, where would the backstop come from? Currently the Fund also lacks a common fiscal backstop as there are still dissenting views concerning an eventual mutualisation of recapitalisation needs resulting from so-called “legacy assets”. In this context, one of my key messages is that the monetary financing prohibition would prevent such fiscal mutualisation through the backdoor of the Eurosystem. Of course, there might be situations where a “funding gap” could arise. How to fill that funding gap will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, also looking at the responsibilities of governments which are the other source of financial support in resolution through State aid.  But it is not my intention to reflect on how such future situations could be dealt with; I have come here to discuss the limits of central bank funding in resolution. In this respect, it is important to repeat that, ultimately, resolution planning should not assume that central bank liquidity will fill the gaps. 3. Concrete examples Let me now give you some concrete examples. We should clearly distinguish between two types of cases depending on where we are in the resolution process: at the time the bank is determined as failing or likely to fail, or when it is put into resolution. At the time the entity is determined as failing or likely to fail As a precondition for a resolution action to be taken the entity needs to be determined as failing or likely to fail. This is one of the three cumulative conditions for triggering resolution. The other two are: No private funding in the market and public interest, in the sense that resolution is necessary to achieve its objectives (art 31 BRRD and 14 SRMR). At that stage though, it will be too early to know whether there is a reasonable prospect of an alternative private sector solution or supervisory intervention and indeed whether resolution is in the public interest. Nonetheless, it is inescapable that the entity’s risk profile will be worsened by the very fact of the “failing or likely to fail” determination.  Since with “failing or likely to fail” the supervisor hands over to resolution, how can it be financially sound since the respect of prudential criteria is by definition controlled by a microprudential authority? In principle, such an entity could still have recourse to Eurosystem monetary policy liquidity provided that it complies with the counterparty eligibility criteria, in particular that it is financially sound and has sufficient eligible collateral. However, to address the uncertainty and the associated risk in the Eurosystem’s counterparty framework, our rules provide that the entity’s access to Eurosystem monetary policy credit instruments is frozen at the level prevailing at the time it is determined as failing or likely to fail. And this decision can obviously only be revisited through a new decision once it is assessed that all conditions for an unlimited access have been restored. Moreover, if necessary, the Governing Council can also impose further restrictions on the grounds of prudence, including suspending access to monetary policy credit operations for an entity with very low capital ratios. Such decisions would be taken on a case-by-case basis to address the specific risk presented by the counterparty. Now let me elaborate further. Let us assume that following the “failing or likely to fail” determination, the entity is facing cash outflows. Since the terms of its access to Eurosystem monetary policy credit operations will have been frozen and perhaps even further restricted, it will not be able to meet its increased liquidity needs through this means.  What will the bank do? It is likely to seek recourse to ELA from its national central bank in order to meet these additional liquidity needs. So if the entity is assessed as “solvent” by the competent supervisory authority and it has sufficient clearly identified eligible collateral it will most probably receive ELA from its national central bank.  Let me pause a moment on these two concepts. The microprudential authorities’ assessment of “solvency” under the current ELA agreement is based on a number of backward-looking indicators, such as the reported Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios with a possible grace period in the case of a credible prospect of recapitalisation within a limited timeframe. We will probably change these indicators in the future in order to take account of forward-looking elements, in line with the evolution of supervisory practices, so as to have a more accurate picture about the solvency of the bank and the appropriateness of continuing to provide ELA, and in view of the fact that FOLTF means a handover to resolution authorities.  What constitutes sufficient collateral for the purposes of ELA is currently for the different national central banks (NCBs) to define. It is, however, essential that sufficient information on such collateral is made available to the relevant NCB and, in turn, to the Eurosystem. If there isn’t enough information, higher haircuts will need to be applied to make up for the increased risk until the necessary details are provided. But ultimately, the provision of emergency liquidity assistance depends on each central bank’s national framework, since ELA is carried out as a national function which national central banks may perform unless the Governing Council finds with a 2/3 majority that it interferes with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB. Since the provision of ELA can interfere with implementation of the single monetary policy (as it is a parallel source of liquidity to the single monetary policy), the Governing Council needs to be informed of the ELA operation in a timely manner. It will assess the situation and, if an interference with Eurosystem tasks is indeed established, object to the granting of ELA. The specific form of an eventual objection is at the discretion of the Governing Council. The Governing Council could, for instance, set certain limits or conditions on the provision of ELA, like the preservation of the financial independence of the NCB. So central bank liquidity could be rolled over within the limits of the entity’s frozen access and through ELA, but this is clearly not warranted in all scenarios for an entity determined as failing or likely to fail. At the time the entity is put into resolution I’ve talked about central banking funding at the time the bank is determined as failing or likely to fail. Let us now examine what can happen later on in the process.  First of all, there are some clear-cut situations where no liquidity can be provided by a central bank, be it under the monetary policy framework or ELA. This is the case for entities put into insolvency or liquidation proceedings.   Second, let us take the example of an entity that is put in resolution following a “failing or likely to fail” determination. Let us assume that it is no longer contributing to monetary policy transmission, because it no longer channels liquidity to the real economy and is in the process of being wound down.  Wind-down entities, whose main purpose is the gradual divestment of their assets and the cessation of their business, have been excluded from access to monetary policy credit operations. This applies for asset management vehicles, too. As regards their access to emergency liquidity assistance, the relevant central bank assesses the situation of each entity according to that central bank’s national framework. However, in most cases, such entities are unlikely to obtain access to ELA if there are doubts as to their solvency, or if this would raise monetary financing concerns.  Third, let us take the situation where the application of one of the resolution tools will lead to the credit institution becoming financially sound again. This would happen through the sale of business tool, the bridge institution tool, the asset separation tool, or the bail-in tool.  The use of these resolution tools will give rise to a number of individual situations which I will not detail here. I can say, though, that in situations in which the failing counterparty continues to exist, its restored solvency will first have to be confirmed by the competent supervisory authority before the Governing Council will decide to “unfreeze” its access to Eurosystem monetary policy liquidity. Such confirmation of the entity’s solvency will also be needed for the provision of ELA. The entity would need to be handed back to the relevant competent supervisory authority to provide information on the required observation of ratios. If the entity is a newly created counterparty, such as a bridge bank, it will first have to be licensed, or obtain a licence, to operate as a credit institution. It will then have to be accepted as a Eurosystem counterparty. This means it will have to fulfil all the eligibility criteria set down in our framework, including the requirement to comply with the relevant capital, liquidity and leverage ratios.  Therefore, if applying one of the resolution tools results in the entity’s financial soundness being restored, or if combining its business with that of an absorbing entity results in the emergence of a financially sound entity or group, access to central bank liquidity could resume after the Eurosystem has made its assessment. But this will depend on the elements I have just described. Time and planning will be of the essence. Indeed, in this stage, the flow of information will be crucial and the competent supervisory authority will have to provide all relevant information on whether the counterparty is fulfilling its capital requirements, so that the necessary decisions on access can be taken. 4. Conclusion Let me draw to a close.  As I have already indicated, liquidity provision by central banks in the event of resolution must not be assumed ex ante, even though the possibility is not excluded provided the specific rules and objectives of the Eurosystem are followed. The provision of central bank liquidity will be the independent and ad hoc decision of the Eurosystem under the respective frameworks for monetary policy and potential emergency lending not interfering with monetary policy. Resolution financing is a government task, now complemented by the rules and procedures applied by the Single Resolution Board and the national resolution authorities within the framework of the SRM. Central banks provide liquidity, not solvency support. And funding gaps that cannot be addressed by the industry or through the Single Resolution Fund should be filled, ultimately, by Member States. Thank you for your attention.      [1] Opinion CON/2012/99 on the proposal for the BRRD: “The ECB wishes to underline that this provision should not in any way affect the competence of central banks to decide independently and at their full discretion on the provision of central bank liquidity to solvent credit institutions, both in standard monetary policy operations as well as emergency liquidity assistance, within the limits imposed by the monetary financing prohibition under the Treaty”.

I admit that it was a long journey, but in my view, it was worth the wait: Basel\\xa0III will help to make banking safer. It is crucial, though, that Basel\\xa0III is properly implemented – in Europe and around the world. It must not be watered down. Basel\\xa0III marks the end of the post-crisis reforms; regulatory certainty has been restored. The banks know what awaits them; they can be confident about the regulatory framework, and can plan ahead and support the real economy. But does Basel\\xa0III deliver what was promised? Does it, on the one hand, create rules which are sufficiently risk-sensitive to set the right incentives for banks? And does it, on the other hand, create rules which are simple enough to decrease model risk? Banks are not enchanted by Basel\\xa0III. Many of them claim that it throws risk sensitivity overboard and penalises low risk exposures. Are these claims justified? Well, we have not thrown risk sensitivity overboard. And why would we? Risk sensitivity helps align capital requirements with actual levels of risk and supports an efficient capital allocation. It prevents arbitrage and risk shifting. And risk-sensitive rules promote sound risk management. But we all know how challenging it is to measure and model risks. Much depends on the quality of the models; much depends on the data and the assumptions that feed into those models; and much depends on supervisors’ capacity to act. If there are errors along the way, banks might end up undercapitalised and vulnerable. This, in turn, might lead markets to question the reliability of risk-based capital requirements in general, which would undermine trust in banks more generally. Therefore we need to balance risk sensitivity with some safeguards. And this is exactly what we aim to do with Basel\\xa0III. It preserves risk sensitivity. It retains internal models for most asset classes. And it enhances the risk sensitivity of the standardised approaches. But at the same time, Basel\\xa0III adds a few safeguards. First, I think we can all agree that it makes no sense to allow for more complex risk-sensitive capital requirements if risks cannot be measured and modelled. Basel\\xa0III therefore aligns the degree of risk sensitivity with the extent to which it is possible to measure and model risks. Second, there are some more conservative haircuts on collateral and some input floors. These input floors lie beneath the parameters for “probability of default” and “loss given default”. And there will be floors beneath the “exposure at default” calculation as well. These floors work bottom-up; they will keep banks from feeding their internal models with excessively low inputs. This serves as a safeguard as it prevents capital requirements from being set too low. And, yes, these input floors make the rules a bit less risk-sensitive. But we need to look at this in absolute terms – for residential mortgages, the input floor increases from three basis points to five basis points. Five basis points correspond to a once-in-2,000 years default rate! Is such a floor really too conservative? At global level, the bottom-up reforms see small increases in capital for exposures to other banks, large corporates and equity investments. This is somewhat offset by a reduction in risk weights for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. Third, there is the hotly debated output floor. It ensures that risk-weighted assets calculated with internal models do not fall too far below those calculated with standardised approaches. “Too far below” means they must reach at least 72.5%. Does that kill risk sensitivity? No, it does not. Obviously, there is still room for banks to apply individual risk weights and to benefit from lower capital requirements for classic, low-risk banking business. And more than that: the effective floor might even be lower than 72.5%. This is due to the fact that many banks apply the standardised approaches to at least some exposures. This implies that, depending on the share of assets still under the standardised approach, the effective floor for them could be lower than 72.5%. At the same time, Basel\\xa0III makes the standardised approaches themselves more risk-sensitive. Let me give you just one example: residential mortgages. Under Basel\\xa0II, the standardised approach assigned the same risk weight to almost all such mortgages. But in Basel\\xa0III, the risk weights of residential mortgages depend on the loan-to-value ratios. The output floor is thus set in relation to a benchmark, which itself has become more risk-sensitive. And let us not forget that, in some cases, the standardised approaches have become less costly in terms of capital. At global level, the capital requirements from standardised approaches have been reduced by about 2% on average. Mortgages and corporate lending make up the majority of these reductions. So, Basel\\xa0III does keep risk sensitivity on board. It acknowledges, though, that there are limits to internal models. It provides safeguards to restore trust in risk-based capital requirements. Does this mean that Basel\\xa0III is the perfect standard – the philosopher’s stone of banking regulation? Well, Basel\\xa0III is a global standard, and across the world, financial sectors differ greatly. Just think of real estate financing and how differently it is treated in Europe compared with the United States. Thus, a global standard cannot suit everyone perfectly. The key is to find an acceptable compromise; the alternative would be to have no global standard, and that would definitely be worse. The output floor in particular is one such compromise. What impact will the final Basel\\xa0III package have on banks – and on their business models and their capital? The rules are not neutral. The bottom-up safeguards in Basel\\xa0III, including the input floors, will impact on risk weights in some business areas. Certain retail credit card exposures are one example. The top-down output floor affects overall capital requirements, depending on the overall portfolio composition of a bank. For example, our analysis suggests that the difference between internal ratings-based and standardised risk weights tends to be relatively large in certain segments of real-estate markets where historical loss rates are exceptionally low. The output floor tends to be more binding for banks which are heavily engaged in these markets. Overall, it is hard to predict how business models will evolve. This depends not only on regulation, but also on many other factors, including the future path of profitability in different business areas, the pricing power of banks and, eventually, how banks will adapt their business models. Now what about additional capital requirements? What about the banks’ claim that the burden might be too heavy for them? Well, there are two things to bear in mind. First, there will be a long transition period. This is at the heart of the overall compromise which paved the way for finalising Basel\\xa0III. This transition period runs right through to 2027. It gives banks and legislators time to implement all the changes introduced by Basel\\xa0III. Second, the European Banking Authority estimates that, for EU banks, the final Basel\\xa0III package will lead to an aggregate Tier 1 capital shortfall of €34.4 billion. Is that a lot? In 2016, the largest banks in the euro area earned €50 billion – net, after taxes, and in a difficult environment. Also, the capital shortfall refers to the end of the transition period, which is nine years away. Most banks should be able to earn their way out of potential shortfalls. To sum up, Basel\\xa0III preserves risk sensitivity in a sensible way. At the same time, banks will be able to handle its impact and, in the long run, they too will benefit from a more stable banking system. Thank you for your attention.   ']\n",
      "['2018-01-29', 'Peter Praet', 'Maintaining price stability with unconventional monetary policy', 'Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Council of the European Union, Brussels, 29 January 2018', '  Maintaining price stability with unconventional monetary policy   Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Council of the European Union, Brussels, 29 January 2018 Slides from the presentation Responding to the crisis in the euro area The crisis that erupted in 2008 sparked a sharp downturn in the global financial cycle[1]. In the preceding years, over-optimistic growth expectations had taken hold in a number of advanced economies. Despite slowing productivity growth, agents overestimated future income growth and borrowed against it, accumulating excessive levels of debt. At the same time, financial liberalisation and deregulation encouraged financial leverage and rapid credit growth. The ten years since that eruption has been a changeable period of deleveraging and de-risking, with a number of different phases.  The first phase was the immediate liquidity crisis triggered by the turning of the global financial cycle and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. Market funding came to a sudden stop for many financial institutions. The ECB’s response was to lower its main refinancing rate to the then record low of 1% in May 2009, to expand the range of eligible collateral for our refinancing operations and to provide liquidity elastically to the banking sector, at both increasingly long durations and against a wider range of collateral.  The second phase was the sovereign debt crisis of 2011-12, which was intensified by the bank-sovereign nexus. Bank funding markets fragmented along national lines and banks in vulnerable countries lost access to wholesale funding. It led to a serious disruption of the monetary transmission mechanism and prevented our accommodative policy stance from reaching the economy.  Our policy response was twofold. First, we carried out two three-year refinancing operations at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012. Second, we announced our conditional Outright Monetary Transactions in summer 2012, which acted as a powerful circuit breaker against self-reinforcing fears in sovereign bond markets. But the sovereign debt crisis nonetheless left the economy with a damaging legacy and paved the way for the third phase of the crisis.  As the euro area entered into a prolonged slump, banks in many parts of the euro area embarked on a slow process of deleveraging, mainly by reducing lending. A credit crunch was looming: by end-2013 loans to the private sector were falling by more than 2% per year. By mid-2014, the economic recovery was losing momentum and the weakness in aggregate demand was starting to depress inflation expectations. The sharp fall-off in oil prices that began in late summer exerted further disinflationary pressures.  Given the weak underlying trend in inflation, we saw a growing risk that low inflation could de-anchor inflation expectations and unleash a deflationary spiral. Short-term interest rates that were already close to zero hampered our ability to use conventional monetary policy instruments. The ECB had to resort to a new approach to ease its monetary stance, based more on directly influencing the whole constellation of interest rates that are relevant for the financing conditions of the economy. This strategy was articulated in three measures.  The first was the launch of a negative interest rate policy, as we lowered the interest rate paid on our deposit facility to -0.1% in June 2014. The second instrument was our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which are specifically designed to support bank lending to the private sector. The third instrument was our asset purchase programme (APP) involving private and public sector securities, which helped further depress the term structure of interest rates by compressing risk premia out along the yield curve.  These instruments were complemented by the use of forward guidance, where we started to communicate about our expectations of future policy, along with the conditions that would warrant a change in the policy stance.  A solid and broad-based economic expansion with subdued price pressures Our monetary policy strategy has borne fruit. We have now seen 18 quarters of positive growth and the short-term economic indicators all point to a continued economic upswing with above-trend growth. The breadth of the expansion is notable: the dispersion of growth rates across both countries and sectors is at its lowest level for two decades.  The euro area recovery has so far been mostly home-grown, with monetary policy creating the conditions for a virtuous circle between rising income and spending in both the corporate and the household sector. Annual growth in employment has reached its highest level since before the crisis and the unemployment rate fell to 8.7% in November, the lowest rate for nearly nine years. An important factor underlying the good performance of domestic demand is the very favourable financing conditions for firms and households, which are heavily influenced by our policy measures. Bank lending rates to non-financial corporations (NFCs) have fallen by around 120 basis points since June 2014, a large proportion of which can be attributed to the impact of our measures.  Moreover, the decline has been more marked in those countries that suffered more acutely from financial fragmentation during the crisis, showing that our measures have not only provided the necessary monetary accommodation, but also rehabilitated the transmission mechanism to ensure an even transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area. Loans to NFCs – sharply down when we introduced our unconventional measures – are growing again, and reached an annual growth rate of 2.9% in December 2017. Taking these factors together, the overall impact of the ECB’s policy measures since mid-2014 are estimated to have contributed significantly to output growth – and by around half a percentage point in 2017. While our measures have clearly played a decisive role in keeping inflation expectations anchored and have contributed to an improved inflation outlook, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below but close to 2%, as reaffirmed by the Governing Council at last week’s meeting. Despite the strong cyclical momentum, domestic price pressures remain subdued, as do measures of underlying inflation. The evolution of the ECB’s forward guidance Our monetary policy stance is determined by the combination and mutual interaction of our asset purchase programme, our policy rates and our forward guidance on each of these tools. The stimulus provided by these policy tools is complemented by the TLTROs, which will remain outstanding for the next three years. When our key policy rates reached exceptionally low levels, asset purchases became the main monetary policy instrument for calibrating our stance. This is why, since January 2015, when the APP started, we have been signalling the traditionally tight connection between the ECB’s monetary policy and our price stability objective by linking an assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation to the size and duration of our net asset purchases. Accordingly, when communicating about net purchases, we have expressed our intention to continue with our chosen pace of monthly purchases until we see “a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim”. This phrase describes the key contingency that has guided the course of our policy in the past few years and will continue to do so in the future. In addition, the pledge to re-invest the proceeds from the principal payments that accrue from the maturing securities in our portfolio should be seen as a necessary complement to the net asset purchases.  Central bank asset purchases ease monetary conditions primarily by taking long-duration bonds out of private hands. It is by withdrawing such assets from the market and holding them for a possibly lengthy period of time that the central bank spurs a rebalancing of private portfolios, and thus lowers term premia and eases financing conditions.  Forward guidance on both policy rates and the APP plays a key role in determining our monetary policy stance. Its function has evolved significantly over time. Before the APP was launched, our forward guidance related only to the expected path of our policy rates. When the Governing Council decided to start issuing statements on its expectations concerning the future evolution of the ECB’s key interest rates, in July 2013, forward guidance was mainly intended to insulate the euro area from external tightening pressures, notably those originating from the global financial turmoil that had followed the “taper tantrum” a few weeks before.  As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in the course of the following year, though, the statement that the Governing Council expected “the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time” turned into a vehicle for easing the monetary policy stance. With the adoption of our APP, forward guidance has been extended to key parameters of our purchases, and has helped investors form expectations about the size of APP and its duration. We have indicated a minimum horizon – an intentional end-date – until which time we plan to carry out net monthly purchases, while always retaining the option of extending the programme beyond that intentional end-date if the “sustained adjustment” condition has not been met. In October 2017, for example, as we extended our net purchases past the end of the year, we signalled that, starting in January 2018, we would “continue at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim”. Moreover, in view of the key role played by the accumulated stock of assets in our portfolio as an ongoing source of stimulus, we committed to “reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary.”  Our instruments are configured in such a way that our forward guidance on policy rates has been reinforced by our forward guidance on net asset purchases. We have linked the expected path of our key interest rates to the intended horizon of the net asset purchases by saying that we “expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”. This sequenced guidance has served to exploit important complementarities between policy rates and asset purchases. On the one hand, having the horizon over which policy rates are expected to remain constant tied to – and longer than – the APP horizon has largely prevented the easing impact of our purchases on the yield curve from being countered by a destabilisation of short-term interest rate expectations. On the other hand, announcing that the APP would have a certain lifespan signalled that policy rates would remain at their present levels for longer. And this has reinforced the power of the statements concerning the evolution of the policy rate path. The forward guidance on policy rates acts as an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact on term premia, and the language on the intended horizon of our net asset purchases has reinforced the signalling power of our forward guidance on rates. Looking ahead, the question is: how will our monetary policy toolbox evolve in the foreseeable future? Monetary policy will evolve in a data-dependent and time-consistent manner. The transition towards a normalisation will begin once we have established that there is a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Our assessment will be based on three criteria for the inflation outlook: convergence, confidence and resilience.  First, convergence: headline inflation will have to be on course to reach levels below, but close to, 2% by the end point of a meaningful medium-term horizon. Two things are noteworthy here: the salience of our inflation aim and the forward-looking perspective. There should be no doubt about our steadfast commitment to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to,, 2%. And the perspective should be forward-looking because our monetary policy framework directs us to shape monetary policy with a firm medium-term orientation. Since the start of Monetary Union, the ECB’s monetary policy has always been formed with a view to stabilising medium-term headline inflation around levels that are most consistent with our price stability definition. Since 2003, we have said that those levels should be below, but sufficiently close to, 2%.  The second criterion on which our assessment is based is confidence, since meeting the first criterion – convergence – is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a sustained adjustment. The Governing Council wants to be sure that the expectation of an upward adjustment in inflation has a sufficiently high probability of being realised and is being met on a sustainable basis, i.e. not as the result of a transitory shock or measurement error. In other words, we need to build strong confidence in the accuracy of our baseline outlook for inflation: the range of possible outcomes around that baseline path should be reasonably contained. This is our second criterion for a sustained adjustment. At our last Governing Council meeting, we have communicated our increasing confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close, to 2%.  How can we substantiate today that inflation convergence has sufficiently strong legs to support its upward trajectory towards our aim? By looking at a broad range of indicators of price pressures, for example measures of inflation trends, notably including core inflation indices. As these underlying inflation statistics – available today – contain information that is valuable for predicting the level of headline inflation in the future, when short-term shocks that may influence its level today have faded away, we want to cross-check our medium-term projections for headline inflation with these measures. In parallel, an eye on capacity utilisation and the extent of unutilised resources can help reinforce our confidence in inflation convergence as a more robust real economy is likely to support a build-up of broad-based price pressures looking forward. Our third criterion, resilience, measures the robustness of inflation convergence to a partial withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. If the inflation outlook is overly dependent on monetary support, the upward adjustment cannot be considered sustained. So, we want to verify that the path would be maintained even in less supportive monetary policy conditions.  Today, we are still some distance away from meeting all three criteria at the same time. So, we still need patience and persistence in steering our policy conduct.  Patience is necessary because it takes time for price pressures to build up, and to be reflected in the information that forms the basis for our assessment of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.  Persistence is necessary because the recovery in inflation is, in itself, a consequence of the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance. Even if incoming data were to validate the expectation of a gradual build-up of inflationary pressures, this would not be sufficient to affirm a sustained adjustment, if even less supportive monetary policy conditions were to imperil the inflation trajectory.  Monetary policy will evolve in a data-dependent and time-consistent manner. Once the Governing Council judges that the three criteria for sustained adjustment have been met, net asset purchases will expire, in line with our guidance. From that point in time, the evolution of inflation will remain conditional on reinvestments continuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net asset purchases. The stock of long-duration assets held in our portfolio will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well beyond the end of our net purchases. Policy rates remaining at their present levels well past the end of our net purchases will contribute to holding the short to intermediate portions of the yield curve in check for as long as necessary, thereby ensuring that financial conditions remain consistent with a sustained adjustment of inflation.

Before I comment on this panel’s topic, let me express my gratitude and satisfaction with the strategic partnership between the ECB and SEACEN, which got off to a successful start this year. Many cooperation activities, ranging from seminars on macroprudential analysis to central bank governance, have already been launched and more is being planned for 2018. I look forward to strengthening our cooperation over the coming years. The topic of this panel deals with the implications of political risks for central banks. Given the independence of central banks and their legal separation from the political dimension, this is obviously a complex issue – and one where monetary policymakers need to tread very carefully.  For this reason, I would first like to spell out how the ECB generally incorporates different kinds of risk into its monetary policy strategy, and how this has influenced our actions over the last few years. I will argue that every central bank is to a considerable extent a risk manager, reflecting the forward-looking nature of monetary policy.  I will then explain why political risks cannot be addressed in the same way as economic risks. Central banks should not prejudge political outcomes through their actions. Rather, they should address their effects if and when they become visible in the economic and financial data that are relevant for their price stability mandates. Monetary policy and risk management My starting point is that monetary policy works with long and variable lags.  In the euro area, for example, the full transmission of interest rate decisions to output has been estimated to be between one and two years, and even longer for inflation.[1] So, if we were to decide policy on the basis of past outcomes, we would always be behind the curve. Monetary policymakers therefore have to look at the economy in a forward-looking way. To do this, we produce forecasts, on a regular basis, that indicate our central expectations for the economy – the baseline. In principle, this should be enough to form a view on how policy should be designed today. But we all know that this would be a bad idea. Policymakers are typically poor forecasters, and central bankers are no exception.[2] This is nothing to be ashamed of. It merely testifies to the fact that the past is often a poor predictor of the future. You can see this quite clearly for the euro area on my first slide. We call it the “spaghetti chart”. It shows the repeated inflation forecast misses over the past few years. On each and every occasion there were good reasons to assume the economy would go the predicted way. But on each and every occasion unpredictable shocks hit our economy that made our central forecast redundant.[3]  The implication is that we would likely have made severe policy mistakes if we had based our policy decisions entirely on our baseline. And bear in mind that the economy can be more or less elastic to different types of shock. A tail risk, if it materialises, may cause the economy to react in a non-linear and potentially disruptive way – hyperinflation and deflation being typical examples of risks central banks want to avoid. For all these reasons, central banks usually augment their forecasts with an assessment of the risks surrounding them. This comprises a distribution of risks – the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of their happening – which, in turn, allows us to form a view on the balance of risks, i.e. whether they are overall tilted to the upside or downside, and on the probability of tail events.  Such risk assessments are not an exact science and there is no automatic link between them and policy decisions. But we do at times apply what Alan Greenspan famously called a “risk management” approach to monetary policy.[4] If the balance of risks is tilted very strongly in one direction, or if the distribution of risks is especially wide, there might be a case for us to act. For example, we might need to provide forward guidance, i.e. specifying how we would react to particular risks. Alternatively, we might need to change our policy stance pre-emptively, especially in situations where tail risks are material and it becomes cost-efficient to truncate that part of the distribution.  The ECB’s monetary policy since mid-2014 illustrates these two aspects well. Around that time, we saw the balance of risks to the inflation outlook shift decisively downwards, while the distribution of risks widened to encompass outright deflation, as you can see by comparing the blue and red lines on my second slide. If they had materialised, those risks would have fundamentally compromised medium-term price stability, and so our strategy required us to respond – even though our central forecast at that time was for a low but positive rate of inflation in the years ahead.  We responded in two main ways. First, we clarified our reaction function to the main risks we saw and the instruments we would use if each of those risks materialised.[5] This sent a clear signal to observers that we were ready to respond in the case of adverse contingencies.  Then, when those contingencies arose, we followed through with our forward guidance and introduced a set of policy measures that was designed to cover the full downside distribution of risks – that is, a very accommodative policy stance to combat disinflationary forces, and an option to be even more accommodative if the situation deteriorated into outright deflation. Thanks to these policy interventions, the distribution of risks has narrowed considerably over time – as you can see from the yellow line – and we no longer see a meaningful probability of deflation. The balance of risks has also shifted upwards as the economic recovery has gathered steam. The current economic expansion in the euro area is stronger than it has been for a decade and broader than for two decades.  This improving picture is the main reason for our recent decision to recalibrate our policy by reducing the pace of our monthly asset purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion, starting in January. Of course, risks emanate not only from our own jurisdiction, the euro area, where we can respond with our monetary policy, but also from the rest of the world. Indeed, while the ECB’s Governing Council currently sees the risks surrounding the euro area’s growth outlook as broadly balanced, it sees downside risks relating primarily to global factors. But here too we can manage risks effectively by cooperating closely with other central banks.[6] This does not mean that we decide jointly on policy actions. It rather means that through our regular bilateral contacts, and dialogues in multilateral fora such as the IMF, the BIS and the G20, we can achieve a better understanding of global risks and their channels of propagation. And when risks do turn into shocks, this cooperation allows us to build up readiness and have the tools in place to react.  Perhaps most importantly, since 2011, the ECB has operated a permanent network of swap lines with the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and others, allowing all participating central banks to obtain foreign currency in the event of a liquidity squeeze. In 2013, the ECB also established a swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China in recognition of its growing systemic importance as well as the rapidly growing bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China.[7]  Factoring in political risks So how do we factor political risks into our decision-making? I would argue that central banks cannot process political risks in the same way as economic risks, for two reasons.  The first relates to the degree of uncertainty that surrounds political risks.  Here it is useful to recall Frank Knight’s classic distinction between risk and uncertainty.[8] Risk is present when future events occur with measurable probability. Uncertainty\\xa0arises when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable. In conditions of uncertainty, it is not possible to manage risk in the sense of quantifying a range of outcomes. Decision-making then depends on qualitative judgement.  To be sure, this is sometimes the situation central banks find themselves in when surveying the economic outlook. The economy is always characterised by both risk and uncertainty, and there are certain situations – for instance, financial crises – in which models fail and uncertainty prevails. In these cases, central banks still have to take decisions and judgement is the only basis we have.  Yet, I would venture that economic risks are, on the whole, more quantifiable than political ones, and hence more conducive to active risk management. This is because we have workable models of the economy with broadly established parameters and regularities. And even when the parameters of those models appear to change – like the Phillips curve today – they still provide us with a framework to think about those deviations and attempt to explain what we are seeing.  For politics, however, we rarely have such tools.  We may be able to gauge from opinion polls the likelihood of a political change of course happening. We may even be able to weigh up political parties’ manifestos and estimate some of the economic consequences of their coming to power.  But fundamentally, we know little about how consumers and firms will react to political developments, and especially to the types of seismic political change that are macroeconomically relevant. Indeed, for such events to be considered a risk they are usually unprecedented. This means that if we were to engage in managing political risks ex ante, most of the time we would be operating in uncertain circumstances and making judgement calls. I would question whether this could really be called risk management at all. Worse still, it would project us into the political domain on very shaky analytical foundations.  This brings me to the second reason why economic and political risks have to be treated separately, and it relates to the endogeneity between monetary policy and risks. In the economic realm, such endogeneity has been recognised as desirable and is a key reason why central banks have become much more transparent over the past two decades or so.  A clear understanding by the public of how the central bank will react to economic risks automatically reduces the likelihood of such risks materialising. For instance, if markets expect central banks to react to adverse shocks by providing monetary accommodation, easier financial conditions will immediately follow. Such anticipation effects can increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. For political risks, however, establishing such expectations would not be desirable. If we were to communicate that we will take decision “X” in response to political outcome “Y”, financial conditions would move as the probability of that outcome rose, and this would potentially prejudice the result. That would be controversial in the case of global political risks. For domestic ones, it would be unacceptable.  Even if the central bank had perfect foresight of the economic consequences, such a reaction function would be seen as undue interference in the political process and it could undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, instead of increasing it.  And since our assessment would be largely based on judgement not analysis – for the reasons I mentioned – we would find ourselves being accused of political meddling. This is a position that no independent central bank would want to be in. So when it comes to political risks, we have to be data-driven. We do not prejudge political outcomes. And we do not try to risk-manage their effects on the economy, since we can rarely predict those effects accurately – and worse, we may end up influencing political developments and thereby compromising our independence.  The only way in which we can include political risks in our policy framework is by responding to their visible impact on economic and financial conditions. This does not mean being complacent: we can and must plan for all eventualities. But we react to data, not to political events themselves. In some ways, this is analogous to the debate about “leaning versus cleaning” of financial bubbles: faced with so much uncertainty about what constitutes a bubble, most of the time it is more efficient for central banks to use macroprudential tools to prick bubbles, or to ease policy after they burst, rather than to try and identify bubbles in advance and deflate them by hiking rates. The risk of false positives is just too high. Two episodes in the recent history of Europe illustrate our data-dependent reaction function: the threat of a break-up of the euro area in 2012; and the threat of a country leaving the European Union in 2016, namely the United Kingdom.  In the first case, we had plenty of data showing that political risks were spilling over dangerously into the economy and financial system. Markets began pricing in redenomination risk. Financial conditions tightened significantly in some Member States. Bank lending contracted and the euro area entered a second recession. Uncertainty in the euro area, as measured by the VStoxx[9], was on the rise – as the grey shaded area on my third slide shows.  Although at this point inflation was still being buoyed up by energy prices and indirect taxes, it was plain to see that political risks had become economic ones, and were in turn endangering the medium-term outlook for price stability. We therefore responded by launching a new monetary policy programme – Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) – which brought this episode of market turmoil to an end.  We did this, however, in a way that did not pre-empt political decisions. We took stock of the clear commitment of European leaders to hold our monetary union together and make it more solid by establishing a banking union. And we made the OMT programme conditional on countries participating in an assistance programme with the European Stability Mechanism. In the case of the UK’s vote to leave the EU, the situation was different, however. Various forecasts predicted severe market turbulence and macroeconomic fallout, so we had contingency plans in place for a range of outcomes. But as the slide illustrates, there were few signs of uncertainty in euro area financial markets in the run-up to the vote or after it. And, so far, there turned out to be no economic consequences with medium-term impact. So our policy stance remained consistent with the data: unchanged. And the same logic, incidentally, can be applied to the recent political crisis in Catalonia. Though we monitored the situation very closely, we saw no changes in financial conditions or the economy that would have warranted a monetary policy shift.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  Monetary policy is a forward-looking enterprise and policymakers always have to think in terms of risks. On several occasions in recent years the ECB has changed its monetary policy in response to emerging tail risks, even when our central forecasts for inflation painted a less alarming picture.  This can be seen as applying a risk management approach to monetary policy, in which we prioritised truncating the most dangerous tails of the distribution rather than targeting our policy at the modal point. The frequent central forecast misses we experienced suggest we were right to do so and we avoided much worse outcomes as a result.  When it comes to political risks, however, central banks cannot be risk managers, since this would bring us too close to being political actors. We can monitor political risks, and we can put in place plans for responding to them – but we can only act when the data justify such a step, and in a way that does not pre-empt political decisions. Our actions during the crisis clearly demonstrated this reaction function.  Thank you.

      "['2017-12-06', 'Yves Mersch', ' Challenges for euro area monetary policy in early 2018', 'Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 32nd International ZinsFORUM, Frankfurt am Main, 6 December 2017', '   Challenges for euro area monetary policy in early 2018   Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 32nd International ZinsFORUM, Frankfurt am Main, 6 December 2017 The Governing Council of the ECB at its October meeting decided to reduce the rate of monthly asset purchases. In my remarks today, I would like to explain the rationale behind that decision, and how it remains consistent with our mandate for price stability. In short, as our asset holdings rise and the growth outlook improves, unchanged policy parameters actually imply greater monetary stimulus. Furthermore, I am confident that the apparent disconnect between growth and inflation is a temporary phenomenon and that inflation dynamics will increase.  It is therefore possible for us to scale back our net asset purchases, while keeping our policy sufficiently accommodative to support those inflation dynamics. If one extrapolates from the current brighter economic outlook, one cannot imagine that we would need to extend further our present purchases. A symmetric approach to our inflation mission would therefore be more appropriate than a one-dimensional promise to do more in case of deflation. Managing QExit will be challenging, however. While ending the purchase programme quickly could provoke undue market reactions, we should not overlook the fact that the longer our asset purchase programme continues, the less effective the programme and the greater the risks attached to it become. Having a credible view of the exit is important to keep any such risks contained.  The recent policy decision Let me begin with the adjustments to our monetary policy parameters made in the October Governing Council meeting. The asset purchase programme will be extended to September 2018, at the lower amount of €30 billion per month, or beyond if necessary, until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its definition of price stability.  This decision was made in an environment of robust demand growth, but with still modest increases in the underlying inflation rate. We have now benefited from 18 uninterrupted quarters of economic growth, with indicators pointing to continued robust growth. The unemployment gap – an established measure of labour market slack – is now closed, and employment has reached its highest ever level in the euro area.  In short, our monetary policy has successfully stimulated demand and returned slack resources into productive use. One would expect this strong demand to generate a marked increase in inflationary pressures. Yet this has not yet fully materialised in the euro area, although signs of inflationary pressures and limits to the lags have been constant for the last six month. Why then have we reduced our purchases before without there being a substantial adjustment in inflation? The decision to reduce the monthly rate of purchases rests on two factors. The first involves understanding how the stimulus provided by our asset purchases evolves over time, and the second relates to the relationship between output and inflation.  The recessions caused by the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis required significant monetary stimulus to counter the large degree of slack in the economy and ensure that inflation remained consistent with our price stability definition. Monetary policy also had to react to a number of headwinds, which reduced the impact of a given level of interest rates on economic demand.  Some, such as an ageing population and the slowdown in measured productivity growth,[1] are longer term in nature. Others were more temporary. The process of deleveraging pushed up desired saving, uncertainty weighed on investment and a prolonged period of low inflation threatened to de-anchor inflation expectations, with a risk of outright deflation.  But as the ongoing recovery gains momentum, the influence of these temporary headwinds is fading. Fears of deflation have dissipated. In these circumstances, unchanged monetary policy parameters would in fact imply an unwarranted increase in monetary stimulus, and when one looks at the 10-year German government bond yield since the summer one might conclude that, despite fewer purchases, we had eased our monetary policy, a step which does not correspond to our plan.  A further reason why the Governing Council elected to scale back our monthly purchases is that, as the size of our portfolio increases, the marginal impact of a given level of purchases increases. Owing to our already large bond holdings, the free float of securities is now substantially lower than when we began our programme in 2015. This increases the relative share of our purchases in the market, and therefore the impact of those purchases per billion euro spent. In other words, a slower pace of purchases today can have an equivalent effect on yields as a higher pace yesterday.  Moreover, as the stock of bonds rises, our reinvestment needs rise in tandem and we have to increase our gross purchases – that is, our net purchases plus our reinvestments; and do that in an environment of lower new borrowing in most euro area countries. This means that, even with a slower pace of net purchases, the Eurosystem will still have a substantial presence in the market. Indeed, cumulative redemptions of around €150 billion are expected in 2018.  For all these reasons, an adjustment to our policy stance was necessary at our last meeting. By the same logic, we should be able to further adjust our policy in the future as confidence increases about the robustness of the recovery without choking off growth or inflation. And the more the recovery advances, the less the economy depends on unconventional monetary policy stimulus and benefits from balance sheets repair, structural reforms and fiscal tailwinds. As for the current rate of inflation, it is worth noting that the euro area is by no means the only developed economy exhibiting robust output growth with inflation rates below historical experience. I do not have time today to do justice to all the various explanations put forward by economists. In truth, I’m not particularly persuaded by any of them. I do not believe that such factors will prevent us from achieving our mandate over the medium term. We may take a little longer to achieve our objective, but achieve it we will. Let me focus on just one explanation – that the relationship between domestic slack and inflation, termed the Phillips curve, has become so flat that changes in output have little effect on inflation. Prolonged periods of low inflation can reduce wage growth, since wage-setters pay some attention to past outturns. Moreover, job insecurity, digitalisation and high unemployment have encouraged unions to prioritise employment over wages. And the deep downturn has led to broader slack in the labour market – i.e. involuntary part-time and temporary work – that needs to be reabsorbed before wage pressures rise.  Yet we are going through a transition phase out of a very deep crisis, and these downward forces should wane. Indeed, the difference between the headline unemployment rate and broader measures of labour market slack has already edged down in the past two years. The share of firms that say that labour shortages are limiting their production is at its highest level ever in manufacturing and services. This is translating into higher wage growth now, and in turn contributing to a pick-up in inflation. Various measures of underlying inflation, which is key for assessing durability, appear to have turned a corner.  I say “appear”, because policymakers should be humble in their pronouncements.[2] Estimates of the degree of slack in the economy vary widely and are often revised. Model outputs, however complex they may be, should be treated with due caution, and judgement based on experience remains an essential part of the policymaking process. We should avoid making unwarranted statements about points in time too far into the future over which we have little true visibility.  It also means that policy decisions not only should be based on the most likely outcome predicted by models, but should also take into account the balance of risks. There are times when the risk of inaction far outstrips the risk of action, and the prudent course is to act with vigour. Introducing asset purchases to stave off the risk of deflation is one recent example. But there are also times when the balance of risks lies in the opposite direction, and prudence dictates that policymakers should be more circumspect. Future challenges for monetary policy On that note, while I believe that the forces already at work should in due course bring an end to the need for asset purchases, it is a matter for the ECB’s Governing Council to decide on the exact timing of such a move. Our approach should evolve in tandem with our improved expectations for developments in the real economy and ensure that our mandate for price stability is fulfilled over the medium term. Let me instead spend a few moments considering some of the risks we face in implementing our policy over the coming years. I should also add at this point that these risks are likely to grow the longer our asset purchase programme continues. The first risk relates to the subsiding deflationary headwinds I have already mentioned. Could it be that our current monetary setting is suddenly too accommodative? In short, because of the uncertainties and imprecisions involved in measuring slack and inflationary pressures in the economy, we might find ourselves behind the curve without realising it. Hence, through the long and variable lags of monetary policy, we will end up with inflation above the rate consistent with our price stability mandate.  This would require a sharp correction of the monetary policy settings in years to come. Yet such a correction of interest rates would pose risks to the financial sector. Banks could be hit hard as funding costs rise faster than interest income on outstanding loans. The second risk is a related one, in that these factors could have already unwound, and inflation could turn out much higher than we expect over the course of 2018. We would find ourselves behind the curve – and realise it – but the optimal monetary policy response would involve us having to adjust our forward guidance.  This forward guidance was put in place to stabilise market expectations and to enhance the effectiveness of our asset purchases. This is because we indicate that interest rates will rise only when we are “well past” the horizon for asset purchases. So prolonging asset purchases pushes out market expectations of the first rate rise, depressing interest rate expectations across the curve. Of course, the effectiveness of that guidance also relies on market beliefs of our future actions.  In effect, forward guidance is a promise not to react to data outturns in the future so as to persuade markets to maintain low expectations for interest rates. But if we offer guidance that extends too far into the distance, beyond the point where we can form reasonable expectations about the economy, it risks unduly tying our hands unless this is backed by unanimity in the Governing Council. This is a particular risk at present when, as I described earlier, any future increase in interest rates needs to be gradual, and hence moving late could result in policy remaining too loose for too long. Certainly as the time comes to reconsider our monetary policy stance during the course of 2018, we should reflect at length on the degree to which we wish to pre-commit ourselves. Risks to monetary policy extend beyond the immediate outlook for inflation. Our policies have reduced the spread over risk-free interest rates paid by households and firms for their borrowing, and unblocked the flow of credit to the real economy. Such spreads are at their lowest ever level. Yet reduced spreads may encourage investment in businesses that are only profitable at low interest rates, and such loans risk turning sour as interest rates rise. Indeed, banks and investors may be tempted to “search for yield”, without being adequately recompensed for the risk they are taking on. The normal place for monetary policy is not at the long end of the yield curve, but at the short end.  The focus of monetary policy is of course on our price stability mandate, and ensuring financial stability risks are adequately mitigated is the role of microprudential supervision and macroprudential policy. While there is little evidence at present of area-wide credit-fuelled bubbles, there are some notable localised pockets, such as in commercial real estate, and evidence of “search for yield” behaviour. The financial crisis showed how such risks can interfere with the smooth operation of monetary policy through their effects on banks, which remain a key part of the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro area. We should therefore bear in mind that these risks could potentially complicate our ability to meet our price stability mandate in the future. There are other longer-term risks to monetary policy, namely through the allocation of credit to both productive and unproductive firms. By reducing interest rates for all firms, monetary policy may indirectly permit inefficient firms to remain in business – becoming so-called zombie firms. This blunts the productivity-enhancing function of downturns to bring about “creative destruction”, whereby inefficient firms are forced out of business, freeing up resources to move to more efficient firms and boosting aggregate productivity. Indeed, there is evidence that creative destruction was weaker during the Great Recession than in previous downturns[3] and that zombie firms have weighed on productivity growth in some euro area countries.[4]  Productivity growth plays an important role in raising aggregate living standards, but it also affects the conduct of monetary policy. Higher productivity growth spurs investment, and expectations of higher future income encourage households to spend more today. Thus slower productivity growth requires monetary policy to lower interest rates by more than would otherwise be the case to stimulate the economy. Given that interest rates are currently low, and our stock of purchases is quite large, this would restrict our ability to respond to future downward shocks. What I have just explained are the economic risks arising from a potential misallocation between productive and unproductive businesses brought about by our asset purchases. But there are also legal risks for the ECB regarding our Treaty obligations. Article 127 requires that we “act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy … favouring an efficient allocation of resources”. Thus, in respecting our price stability mandate, we should only do as much as is necessary, and be aware of potential side effects from running expansive policy for too long. An important principle of an open market economy is price formation in markets through the interaction of private sector agents. It should be those interactions that ensure correct pricing, notably of credit risk, and not the interactions created by our asset purchases.  It is clear that, with the Eurosystem now owning public and private sector assets amounting to over €2 trillion, we have become a bigger player in the market than ever before. This means that we are now buying bonds from more price-insensitive investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, bidding up the price at which we need to pay. Liquidity conditions are expected to become more challenging in certain market segments the longer the purchasing programme remains active.  As such, we have to be mindful not to exert an undue influence on price formation. Another potential complication relates to our public sector purchases. A key safeguard that we have set up for these purchases is to operate so-called “blackout periods”, where we do not buy around the date of a new issuance. This facilitates price formation and ensures that Article 123 of the Treaty is fully respected – the monetary financing prohibition. Mindful of self-imposed constraints in this respect the remaining space for both net and gross purchases will largely be in newly issued bonds. This poses some potential complications that we have to monitor very closely.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The recovery in the euro area continues at a robust pace, employment has risen strongly. Both wages and underlying inflation appear to have turned the corner. At its October meeting, the Governing Council chose to reduce the rate of net asset purchases, which, as I have explained today, prevented an unwarranted increase in monetary stimulus. We will continue to monitor developments in the economy and set policy in a way that is consistent with our price stability mandate. In doing so, we must also take into account the balance of risks when setting policy.  If we withdraw our monetary policy stimulus too early and too fast, asset prices could drop and yields rise sharply, with negative spill-over effects to the economy. At the same time, we have to be mindful, as our asset purchase programme continues, that the risks attached to it may increase the longer it lasts. Nourishing a market belief that the exit might be permanently postponed could exacerbate the potential cliff effects. A credible perspective on exit is needed to keep these risks contained. A sense of proportion will therefore be crucial in managing the QExit.      [1] See, e.g., Gordon, R.

We have now seen 18 quarters of positive growth and the short-term economic indicators all point to a continued economic upswing with above-trend growth.  The breadth of the expansion is notable. The dispersion of growth rates across both countries and sectors is at its lowest level for two decades, reflecting a convergence of growth rates around higher levels. This is reassuring for the growth outlook because recoveries tend to be firmer and more robust when they are broad-based. Progress in the euro area recovery has been mostly home-grown, with a virtuous cycle increasingly taking hold between rising income and spending in both the corporate and the household sector. An important driver behind the good performance of domestic demand is the very favourable financing conditions for firms and households, which are heavily contingent on our policy measures. However, the positive developments also reflect the pay-off from years of balance sheet repair, institution-building – at both national and Union level – and structural reforms. In the banking sector, enhanced regulation and supervision have steered the sector towards safer business models and stronger capital profiles. Euro area banks have shored up their capital positions with average Common Equity Tier\\xa01 capital (CET1) having increased from 7% in 2007 to 14.1% at present. Banks have also disposed of non-core assets, reduced their exposure to market risk and generally refocused their activities on more traditional business models. These measures imply that banks are today in a much better position to intermediate between those who save and those who want to invest, thereby supporting the recovery.  Banking sector repair has also been helped by structural reforms. A number of euro area countries have, for instance, enhanced the effectiveness of their insolvency regimes. In corporate debt restructuring, experience to date shows that an effective insolvency regime is critical to facilitate the early rescue of viable firms and the speedy exit of non-viable ones. Internal ECB analysis has confirmed that EU countries with better insolvency frameworks deleverage faster and are able to adjust their non-performing loans more rapidly than countries with weaker regimes. In turn, this has been shown to lead to easier financing conditions for companies, to stronger entrepreneurship and to higher productivity.[2]  Reforms have generally been stepped up in the euro area. The OECD’s Going for Growth – which identifies and reviews progress on five key priorities in areas including labour, product markets, and tax and transfer systems as well as on financial sector reform for all OECD countries – shows an increase in the reform momentum in most euro area countries since the start of the crisis. Results from the European Commission’s labour market reforms database (LABREF) show a similar trend. In addition, the Commission has assessed that at least “some progress” has been made on around two-thirds of the country-specific recommendations issued between 2011 and 2016.[3]  Even more important, an increasing number of empirical studies confirm the positive economic impact of these reforms. For instance, in Italy the introduction of a new permanent contract in 2015 led to a 5% increase in new gross hires.[4] Along similar lines, the Spanish labour market reform is found to have increased the likelihood of exiting from unemployment to employment, while the direct transition from temporary to permanent positions is also eased by the reform.[5] Meanwhile, evidence based on micro-data for Portuguese firms shows that the liberalisation of product markets has lifted the productivity of downstream industries, even in the short run. And research has shown that even smaller-scale reforms and in particular those that can reduce the fixed costs of firms, such as measures to reduce red tape, can have significant positive effects.[6]  These positive developments should not mask the long-term challenges that the euro area is still facing. Our estimate of potential growth has declined substantially over the past two decades – in part due to the decline in multifactor productivity growth. The public sector debt ratio remains elevated, while our population is ageing. Overall, structural indicators still reveal substantial gaps, both between euro area countries and relative to best performers. This matters not just for welfare and social cohesion within individual countries. It also matters for the functioning of Monetary Union. If countries have very different economic structures, their business cycles will diverge when faced with common shocks: some will return quickly to trend growth and full employment, while others will require a longer period of recession for prices and quantities to fully adjust. By contrast, better, mutually compatible economic structures among countries support growth on a sustainable basis and produce less dispersion when recessions hit. Reforms which improve economic structures make countries more resilient and the single monetary policy more effective.  The current economic expansion offers a unique window of opportunity to make further progress in Europe’s reform agenda. During good times, countries can better afford the adjustment costs of reforms and may have more fiscal space available to compensate losers (see OECD, 2012). As Christine Lagarde recently reminded us: “the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining”.[7]  History, alas, suggests that this rarely happens. In good times, reforms tend to face strong opposition, which only breaks down during times of economic demise, either following a long period of economic decline or in the wake of a severe crisis.[8] Evidence of crisis-led reforms is plentiful: for instance, not just the Latin American trade reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, but also the most recent experience in the euro area goes in this direction.  So how can we do things better in future? Structural reforms are nothing new in Europe’s policy debate. They have been discussed since the 1970s, when European growth and employment started to fall behind that of the United States. The substantial step-up in reform momentum during the crisis has revived this debate along three dimensions: the trade-off between short-term costs and long-run benefits, the distributional incidence of structural reforms, and finally the scope of the reform agenda. First, the trade-off between short-term costs and long-run benefits. The long-run benefits of reforms are largely undisputed[9], but the potential short-term costs have increasingly been highlighted. Such undesirable effects can materialise through a number of channels. Reforms that enhance competition can displace workers and capital in the short run. In bad economic times, there is a risk that these factors of production will not be absorbed by new entrants, thereby aggravating the recession. Reforms that lower wages can depress consumer demand in the short term if not rapidly offset by employment gains and the prospect of future productivity-related income gains that would materialise in normal times.  To ensure that the expansionary effect of reforms dominates in the short run, both the sequencing of reforms and the policy mix matter. As regards sequencing, research has shown that outcomes may be better if product market reforms precede labour market reforms[10] and if product market reforms focus on reducing entry barriers in service sectors with large pent-up demand.[11] As regards the policy mix, if there is fiscal space, IMF research[12] has underscored the beneficial effects of carefully designed fiscal packages which can overcompensate for the short-run cost of reforms.  Second, the distributional effects of reforms. That growth is not necessarily distribution-neutral already drew some attention towards the end of the 1960s. The macroeconomic disruption that followed the oil crisis of the mid-1970s, however, completely overshadowed distributional issues, as research priorities shifted towards macroeconomic stabilisation and structural adjustment of inefficient economies.[13]  Recent experience and research have however shown that growth is actually more difficult to achieve without equity.[14] Moreover, highlighting the benefits of reforms in terms of macroeconomic growth is not enough to make them socially acceptable.[15] The distributional costs of reforms have triggered heated debates and in some quarters the term “structural reforms” is even perceived as “toxic”.[16]  The feeling that growth in recent years has become less inclusive is borne out by the data. Income inequality in OECD countries stands at a historical high and household disposable incomes across most euro area countries remain below pre-crisis levels, especially for the poorest members of society. Social transfers continue to play an important role in dampening the effects of inequality, although they have become less effective since the mid-1990s.[17]  In such an environment, we must ensure that the distributional impacts of reforms are not ignored. One way to do this in practice is to focus on reforms that entail a double dividend: increasing equity while lifting growth. Examples include measures that facilitate the accumulation of human capital, reduce labour market dualism or abolish product market regulations that stifle competition.[18] Back in 2006, the Lisbon Council think tank[19] already flagged the importance of raising and enhancing human capital in its policy brief “Innovation at Work: The European Human Capital Index”. In particular with “routine-biased technological change” increasingly permeating and transforming the world of work, high-quality education and training systems are vital to ensure that workers can withstand the disruption caused by this change and benefit from it. Another way to account for the distributional impacts of reforms is – for those reforms that have unavoidable negative distributional costs – to work out “smart redistribution” packages. Smart redistribution does not necessarily take the form of a fiscal transfer. What laid-off workers most want is to have a new job. Hence public policies could focus on helping people back into work, and into jobs where they can develop and refine their skills.  Finally, the third dimension relates to the scope of the reform agenda. Structural reforms should not be limited to product and labour market reforms. Strong institutions and a well-functioning financial sector at national and euro area level are necessary conditions to ensure that the impact of other reforms actually materialises. Our reform agenda should be sufficiently broad and tackle the binding constraints in the economy. This requires country-specific and country-tailored solutions which allow each Member State to find and exploit their comparative advantages in the Single Market.[20] But it does not mean that countries can reform independently of each other.  Indeed, to ensure convergence, countries do not necessarily need to have the same economic structures, but they do need to ensure that their economic structures foster resilience and contribute to a more homogeneous transmission of common shocks. For example, if one set of countries focuses mainly on reforms to make wages adjust more quickly in response to shocks, and another on reforms to produce adjustment through employment, the first group will recover more quickly than the second. Research[21] has shown that countries will only converge in their response to shocks if they have a broadly similar mix of labour market institutions – or to put it another way, broadly similar Phillips curves. Encouragingly, this research finds that changes in labour market institutions since the creation of the single currency have actually contributed to a more homogeneous transmission of common shocks. However, the dispersion could still be considerably reduced.[22]  From a euro area perspective, it is thus vital to ensure sufficient resilience and convergence among countries so that all can benefit from Monetary Union, but not so much as to interfere with national social choices. So this brings me to the question: what role can European institutions play in ensuring resilience and convergence among euro area countries? While the responsibility for structural reform has so far primarily been at national level, European institutions have a strong coordinating role to play. However, relying merely on rules and coordination to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes may not always be sufficient. In some areas, such as banking sector policy, moving from a system of rules and guidelines for national economic policymaking to a system of further sovereignty-sharing within common institutions has been highly beneficial for the Union and its Member States. Over recent years a quantum leap forward has been taken by moving from decentralised banking supervision and resolution to the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, based on the single rulebook. These steps have created the conditions for deep and durable financial integration. It remains essential to complete the banking union in all its dimensions. To underpin confidence in a durable way in the area-wide financial system, both supervisory responsibility and the fiscal backstop need to be at European level. Just as necessary is the establishment of a European Deposit Insurance System. Strengthening Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will, over time, require us to make progress in all policy areas. In a monetary union, no policy area can be seen in isolation. Each interacts with and affects the others. After years of reform efforts, there is an increasing risk that fatigue is setting in: both “reform fatigue” and “integration fatigue” may increasingly reduce the willingness to fix the flaws in the design of EMU. This reluctance may be further intensified by the current good economic times, which reduce the sense of urgency. This is why it is so important to resolutely pursue the debate on completing our Economic and Monetary Union. To conclude, the euro area is currently in a broad-based and solid expansion. While monetary policy still plays an important role in sustaining the recovery, it is not “the only game in town”. Years of balance sheet repair, institution-building – at both national and supranational level – and structural reforms are all supporting the recovery. However, let us not yet declare victory and “bask in the warmth of the recovery”[23]: more needs to be done to lift growth on a sustained basis and to reduce the euro area’s vulnerability to shocks. Looking ahead, well-crafted reforms that combine growth with equity and take account of the macroeconomic backdrop will be pivotal, both at national and European level.

      "['2017-11-30', 'Yves Mersch', 'Digital transformation of the retail payments ecosystem', 'Introductory speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Joint ECB and Banca d’Italia conference, Rome, 30 November 2017', '  Digital transformation of the retail payments ecosystem   Introductory speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Joint ECB and Banca d’Italia conference, Rome, 30 November 2017 Efficient and safe retail payments systems are a precondition for the functioning of any modern economy. They allow for everyday transactions to take place, thus providing the foundation for commerce and trade. Central banks through cash and banks have traditionally offered these services. And they were successful in creating a secure and trusted payment ecosystem for consumers. However over time the banking\\xa0ecosystem has developed inefficiencies.\\xa0It has lost some ability to innovate and adapt to the changing needs of the end user. In Europe technological disruptions, competition from non-banks and regulatory pressure have forced banks to re-examine how they provide retail payment services. The ability to provide real-time services will be essential if banks want to retain and gain customers. The\\xa0strategic importance of instant payments\\xa0cannot be overstated. The move towards a real-time world with the provision of real-time services cannot happen without pan-European instant payments. They will provide a\\xa0new framework for innovative and efficient retail payments\\xa0in Europe. My talk today will focus on instant payments but I will also briefly discuss the alleged innovation brought by private virtual currency schemes without an identifiable issuer. The foundations of instant payments and ensuring stakeholder involvement The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was the origin of today’s digital landscape for retail payments in Europe. It is a key ingredient of Europe’s single currency and was necessary to bring the full benefits of the euro closer to all citizens. This integration of electronic retail payments in Europe was full of challenges and was only completed 12 years after the introduction of euro notes and coins. One of the most prominent issues that faced SEPA was the lack of full stakeholder involvement. Initially, SEPA was considered an “IT” project to be implemented by banks. It was not seen in the overall context of a project that could transform payments in Europe. The project did not engage enough with Europe’s consumers and businesses. Support from all stakeholders is thus crucial to the success of any such undertaking. To facilitate such support, the ECB established the\\xa0Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB). The ERPB brings together both sides of the market, the supply and the demand side, the banks and the end users in order to further the development of an integrated, innovative and competitive market for euro retail payments in the EU. This cooperation has led to new synergies. It gave a voice to those who felt excluded from the process of innovation in retail payments. Recently we have gone further to enhance European cooperation and have established, in conjunction with the European Commission, the\\xa0European Forum for Innovation in Payments\\xa0(EFIP). This body brings together the national payments committees with the ERPB to foster integration and innovation for retail payments in Europe. The ERPB was instrumental in bringing the vision of real-time payments to Europe with the inception of instant payments. The European Payments Council, acting on guidance from the ERPB, created the SEPA instant credit transfer scheme. I am pleased that this scheme was successfully launched last week and let me congratulate the following eight countries which signed up to the service as of today. The tech-savvy nations are: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Now, European end users whose banks have already joined and implemented the scheme can send and receive instant payments across Europe in less than 10 seconds. A positive end-user experience will ultimately determine the success of instant payments. The ERPB is supporting the work of the industry and other stakeholders to facilitate the initiation of an instant payment using the recipient’s mobile telephone number as a proxy for their IBAN, no matter where they are located in the EU. The ERPB expects that a pan-European mobile proxy lookup service will be ready by the end of 2018 at the latest and I urge all stakeholders to ensure that this deadline is met. However, to facilitate the full roll-out of instant payments, we have to enable reachability of all banks in Europe. To enable full reachability, the Eurosystem has decided to launch an\\xa0instant payment settlement system\\xa0in central bank money, the Target instant payment settlement (TIPS) service. TIPS is scheduled to go live in November 2018. Appropriate regulatory framework SEPA and instant payments did not happen in isolation. An appropriate legislative framework that supports digitalisation, innovation and competition is also needed. In Europe we realise this importance. The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) will provide the necessary legislative framework to allow for innovation. It will enhance payment account access for regulated and authorised third-party providers. It will facilitate the participation of new actors in the payments market. These actors will provide new innovative services, reduce costs and give consumers more choice. However, this can only happen if standardised access to the payment account is provided. I would therefore call upon stakeholders such as banks, standard-setting organisations and third-party providers to work together to ensure a\\xa0single standard is developed for payment account access.  The competition introduced by the revised Payment Services Directive can also provide an opportunity for incumbent banks but only if they\\xa0act urgently to implement instant payments. It is crucial that banks invest to upgrade their legacy batch systems to enable real-time processing and offer end-user solutions for instant payments. These solutions can provide them with a strong tool to face the upcoming competition. The recent experience with contactless payments shows that banks, in cooperation with other stakeholders, are well capable of rolling out payment innovations that can quickly take off and improve end-users’ payment experience. Virtual currencies It is my view that future innovations in retail payments will be based on instant payments in combination with account access provided by the PSD2. I would like to stress this point, especially in view of the ongoing public debate around the\\xa0alleged innovation brought by private virtual currency schemes or tokens.  While we have seen a substantial increase, albeit from low levels, in the value of some of the virtual currencies lately, we should not forget that their usage as a settlement asset is marginal and the\\xa0overall user acceptance as a means of payment is negligible. In fact, retail payment traffic in Europe alone is orders of magnitude higher than the global transaction volume of virtual currencies. In view of the speculative market environment for virtual currencies and for other types of virtual financial asset, one should bear in mind that these are by definition virtual: they do not constitute a claim on an issuer and\\xa0do not formally qualify as currency. Their purchasing power fluctuates wildly and depends solely on the market activity of speculators. It remains to be seen whether these virtual currencies can be considered as a payment alternative for consumers – except in extreme cases like in failed states – and to what extent they can compete with the solutions market players will be able to develop in the\\xa0safer and more efficient European retail payments market. The ECB continues to monitor these developments, not only from a market infrastructure perspective, but also as regards monetary policy, financial stability and prudential supervision. And while we continue to fully meet the increasing\\xa0demand for safe and efficient banknotes we shall also experiment with cash on different digital technologies. Other adventurous applications of a more disruptive nature are simply not robust enough from a legal, operational and governance point of view, to name but a few shortcomings which make these assets unfit for recognition from the point of view of our mandate of efficient payments systems. Conclusion To conclude, the benefits of digital transformation and innovation for citizens can only be achieved by means of full stakeholder cooperation and an appropriate regulatory framework that fosters innovation. Banks need to implement instant payments as soon as possible and provide an alternative narrative to the ongoing public debate on the alleged innovation brought by virtual currency schemes. Instant payments in conjunction with the building blocks provided by the PSD2 can offer new business opportunities for banks and third-party providers and provide citizens with a real-time safe payment experience.

As you know, the Prize is awarded to an outstanding, young European economist who works in the fields of macroeconomics and finance. Without a doubt, Ricardo is one of the leading macroeconomists of his generation. Today, we recognise in particular Ricardo’s influential research on expectation formation and sticky information as well as on the role of fiscal policy in business cycles. Ricardo’s most cited paper – and he has written many frequently cited papers – is “Disagreement about inflation expectations”, co-authored with Gregory Mankiw and Justin Wolfers.[1] This early paper showcases what have been the consistent characteristics of Ricardo’s work: his research is data-driven, innovative and deals with topics important for economic policy – in this case monetary policy, given the interest of central banks in inflation expectations. While there had been work on inflation expectations prior to Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers, their paper – together with other work done around the same time by Ricardo, some of it with Gregory Mankiw, and independently by Woodford and Sims – opened a new chapter in research on expectation formation.[2] Since then, numerous economists have been motivated to develop models of data on expectations, and to study the implications of such models for the transmission of shocks and for policy. Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers documented substantial disagreement among both consumers and professional economists about expected future inflation. The extent of disagreement in the data evolves over time, together with the state of the economy. A high dispersion of inflation expectations is positively correlated with a high level of inflation, and with a high variance in recent inflation. Ricardo and his co-authors also studied the average forecast across agents, finding weak sensitivity of the average forecast to news and serially correlated forecast errors. Subsequent research, which builds on the work of Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers, has confirmed and refined these findings. It has established that expectations deviate systematically from full-information rational expectations. The average forecast across agents of a macroeconomic variable responds slowly to news. If a shock raises inflation for some time, the average forecast of inflation increases by less than inflation itself. Moreover, the average forecast error in a cross-section of agents is likely to be of the same sign as the ex ante revision in the average forecast. If inflation is rising and forecasts tend to be revised up, the average forecast error is likely to be positive – people are likely to under-predict inflation. This is, of course, in contrast to the theory of full-information rational expectations, where forecast errors are unpredictable. The same pattern is present in the data for survey-based and market-based measures of inflation expectations, for expectations of macroeconomic variables other than inflation, among consumers and professional economists, and in different countries.[3]  Ricardo, together with Gregory Mankiw, developed a theory that accounts for the salient features of the data on expectations.[4] In the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis, economic agents update their information only sporadically. When agents fail to update, they make decisions based on information that is to some extent out of date. The updating is staggered across the population, so that at any one time some people are paying attention to news, while others remain inattentive. As a result, information diffuses gradually in the economy. The average forecast responds slowly to news, as in the data. Each individual makes the best forecast given their information. At the same time, however, the average forecast error across agents can be predicted by the ex ante revision in the average forecast, as in the data. Finally, again in line with the data, agents in the model disagree, because their information sets differ. In sum, the sticky information model suggests how expectations are actually formed in the real world. A number of interesting policy implications arise from this more real-world account of expectation formation. As Ricardo showed in a paper with Lawrence Ball and Gregory Mankiw, optimal monetary policy – given productivity and demand shocks – is price level targeting, as opposed to inflation targeting.[5] This is a controversial proposition with practical inconveniences that render it unpopular among central bankers. There have thus been no attempts to implement it. A broader lesson for monetary policy resulting from the analysis is that long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more stable in a sticky-information world. Central bankers will probably find this message reassuring. On the other hand, the sticky information model suggests that, once long-term inflation expectations become de-anchored, their return to a level consistent with price stability may take time and effort on the part of the central bank. Ricardo and Gregory Mankiw constructed and estimated a complete dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky information.[6] Their DSGE model features what the authors refer to as “pervasive stickiness”: the idea that information sets are updated sporadically, which originally applied to price-setting firms, is extended here to include consumers and workers. The resulting theory predicts gradual responses of consumption, output and wages to macroeconomic shocks, in addition to the sluggish response of prices. Remarkably, sticky information is the only source of slow adjustment in the model. By contrast, the New Keynesian DSGE model requires multiple frictions, such as habit formation in consumption and investment adjustment costs, on top of price and wage stickiness, in order to capture the persistence in the macro data. The sticky information approach suggests that the origin of the pervasive slow adjustment in the data may be different from the sources highlighted in the New Keynesian literature. In an influential pair of papers, “Inattentive Producers” and “Inattentive Consumers”, Ricardo studied the decisions of agents who face the costs of acquiring, absorbing and processing information.[7] Such agents rationally choose to be inattentive to news, only sporadically updating their information. The optimal frequency of updates, or the length of inattentiveness, depends on features of the economy such as the variance of shocks. Upon aggregation, the economy behaves like the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis. Let me turn to Ricardo’s work on the role of fiscal policy in business cycles. While a large body of literature in this area exists, much of it assumes a representative agent and focuses on government purchases or taxes. Ricardo, in a joint paper with Hyunseung Oh, documented that during the Great Recession much of the increase in government expenditures across the OECD countries was in government transfers.[8] To study the effects of transfers, Ricardo and his co-author proposed a model without a representative agent or Ricardian equivalence, in which transfers affect the economy because of imperfect credit markets, uncertainty and sticky information. Building on this work, Ricardo and Alisdair McKay constructed a model to assess the role of automatic stabilisers in business cycles.[9] Their Econometrica paper will be a benchmark in the literature on fiscal policy, and they now have a follow-up paper that adds the normative perspective.[10] Their analysis – novel and more generally applicable – combines the New Keynesian DSGE framework with the incomplete-markets, heterogeneous-agent model of consumption and inequality. The resulting theory includes a realistic array of automatic stabilisers, such as unemployment benefits and progressive income taxes. The authors are able to quantify a number of mechanisms by which automatic stabilisers may work. One lesson is that unemployment benefits are especially effective in supporting aggregate demand in a recession. People who become unemployed reduce their consumption sharply, in particular if their period of unemployment is likely to be prolonged. Moreover, those who remain employed increase their precautionary savings in a downturn as the probability of losing their job rises. In this environment, more generous unemployment benefits have strong effects on aggregate spending. Another takeaway is that – in the US data from the so-called Great Moderation period – automatic stabilisers appear to have played little role in smoothing out the business cycles, with monetary policy being much more important. That said, Ricardo and Alisdair show that automatic stabilisers can have more sizeable effects when the central bank is constrained by the effective lower bound on its policy rates. . In any case, the conclusion about automatic stabilizers having subdued effects opens up the debate about how to make them more effective and about the need in some situations to use discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy. Recently, Ricardo has worked on models in which the central bank’s balance sheet is explicitly present. Such models are in demand in the wake of the global financial crisis, given the need to understand the effects of the expansion of the balance sheets of many central banks. Ricardo has developed, together with Robert Hall, a framework to analyse central banks’ solvency under “new-style central banking” and studied a model in which the interest rate on bank reserves is the main policy tool of the central bank.[11] As you know, besides his research activities, Ricardo has also been an active participant in policy debates, notably concerning safe bonds for the euro area and economic developments in his native Portugal.[12]  Ricardo’s work is macroeconomics at its best: in contact with data, innovative and with lessons for policymakers. Please join me in congratulating Ricardo on being awarded this year’s Bernácer Prize. Ricardo, I wish you continued success in the future.      [1] Mankiw, N. G., Reis, R. and J.

      "['2017-11-24', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'Policy analysis with big data', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference on “Economic and Financial Regulation in the Era of Big Data”, organised by the Banque de France, Paris, 24 November 2017', '  Policy analysis with big data   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference on “Economic and Financial Regulation in the Era of Big Data”, organised by the Banque de France, Paris, 24 November 2017 The recent financial crisis, and the euro area sovereign debt crisis that followed, were characterised by periods of increased heterogeneity, market fragmentation and sudden turns in economic activity. This often made it difficult for economic policymakers to understand and assess in real time the underlying forces driving economic behaviour. Both traditional statistical datasets and our models proved at times inadequate to support the decision-making process, reflecting long time lags, linear assumptions and the absence of more granular information.  These events increasingly boosted the efforts in policy circles to obtain timelier and richer data for policy analysis, in short big data.[1] This push towards more granular information was not a revolution, however. It can be argued that big data, under different guises, have been used as an input into policymaking since Adolphe Quételet’s Mémoire in 1848. Since then, big data has been central to business cycle analysis, from the early work of Clément Juglar to the contributions of both Wesley Mitchell and the Cowles Commission, right up until today. According to central bank mythology, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan would sit in his bathtub perusing sheets of statistics. And indeed, economic historians have analysed how the power of governments has been shaped by statistics – and vice versa.[2]  The most recent push towards more granular data was thus an evolution rather than a revolution, triggered in part by the emergence of new opportunities – themselves a reflection of rapid technological progress – and the experience gained over several years of crisis management. This evolution is already bearing fruit. Policymakers today have access to a large number of micro datasets, often very different in nature and scope. Some are the result of new financial regulations. Others are by-products of increased use of technology. What they have in common, however, is that, if used appropriately and responsibly, they can help policymakers to extract more timely and diverse economic signals, and thus are a meaningful complement to existing official data. In my remarks this morning, I will take stock of the progress made at the ECB, and in the central banking community more generally, on the use of more granular data in the conduct of monetary policy.[3] I will show that micro data collected by central banks themselves, in particular data on transactions between banks, have already proven to be an additional valuable guide for policymakers in devising policy responses. And I will show that data generated through the greater use of technology in our daily lives have an enormous potential to help policymakers overcome prevailing constraints on timely data availability, understand better the consequences of their policies and calibrate them accordingly, while also creating challenges.  Central banks as big data collectors Let me start with the role of central banks as producers of big data.  Central banks do not have to be at the forefront of data collection, and we should not seek to displace private sector efforts. That said, there are areas in which central banks have started, or are about to start, collecting large amounts of data to help them monitor developments in financial markets and allow them to extract richer information about the transmission of monetary policy, which in turn helps us calibrate our policies. As a showcase for these efforts, I would like to discuss two such initiatives, namely the money market statistical reporting (MMSR) data, which the ECB, in collaboration with the wider Eurosystem, has been collecting since July 2016, and the so-called AnaCredit project, short for “analytical credit datasets”, which will produce its first results over the course of next year.[4]  MMSR data contain confidential daily information on the individual euro-denominated loans in the euro money market from the 52 largest euro area banks, which collectively account for approximately 80-85% of the total balance sheet of euro area banks. At present, this means collecting information on 10,000 daily transactions in the unsecured money market, with a daily volume of around €100 billion. We also collect data on around 30,000 daily transactions on secured loans, worth around €500 billion. Earlier this week, the project took an important step forward with the publication of the first set of euro area money market statistics, covering each of the Eurosystem’s reserve maintenance periods in 2017.[5] The published data cover the unsecured market. The aim is to publish data on the secured market in 2018 once we are satisfied that the data are of sufficiently high quality. The sheer volume of data, combined with the high frequency with which it is collected, means that the standard verification process involving human beings is not feasible. Carrying out checks by algorithm, using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence is one way of ensuring that data remain of high quality. The Eurosystem has a steep learning curve in front of itself.  These efforts will no doubt pay off. Indeed, MMSR data have proven highly useful to policymakers in their short period of existence. Let me give you an example. The data help us assess the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) on market functioning, as I explained in more detail in a speech I gave last week in Brussels.[6]  MMSR data show that since the ECB launched the APP there has been a marked shift away from trades backed by general collateral, which are traditionally used to manage cash. Instead, there has been a growing share of repos off the general collateral curve, termed specials. Take for example the German Bund market. Traditionally, only around 5% of bonds in the German repo market traded as special, but in the second half of last year, that share rose to 50%.  Being aware of the distribution of trades and the premium placed on special bonds enables us to assess the impact of the APP on market functioning. To ease potential frictions, we decided last December to allow cash to be used as collateral in our securities lending programme, and to permit APP purchases below the deposit facility rate. As a result of these decisions, the “specialness” premium on long-term German bonds has declined, and the share of bonds that trade special is now around 30%. A further notable area of use for MMSR data has emerged from growing concerns about the reliability and robustness of current risk-free benchmark rates for the euro area.[7] Banks have become increasingly reluctant to participate in benchmark panels, owing to concerns about potential litigation, compliance risks and costs. The resulting uncertainty in the integrity of reference rates represents a potentially serious source of vulnerability and systemic risk. Against this backdrop, the ECB recently announced that it intends to provide a new overnight unsecured interest rate, using MMSR transaction data. The new rate is intended to complement existing benchmark rates produced by the private sector and serve as a backstop reference rate, with the aim to start publishing by 2020.[8] This move is motivated by our desire to mitigate the potential adverse impact on the monetary transmission mechanism and on financial stability from the lack of reliable benchmarks. The market facilitating role played by the ECB in this field is consistent with the tasks conferred upon it by its Statute. The process will involve broad consultation with market participants, end-users and other public authorities. A first public consultation will be launched before the end of 2017.  The use of MMSR data implies that the new overnight interest rate will differ from the current EONIA benchmark in a number of ways.[9] Accordingly, any decision pertaining to this new benchmark rate does not bear direct consequences for the choice of our operational target. Let me now say a brief word about the second initiative I mentioned earlier, namely the AnaCredit project, which will push the frontier of big data use at the ECB further out.[10]  AnaCredit will deliver loan-by-loan information, mostly on a monthly basis, on credit to companies and other legal entities extended by euro area banks. Early estimates point to around 70 million exposures reported every month, representing loans granted by about 4,500 credit institutions to more than 15 million counterparties.[11] In view of these large expected data volumes, a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure is currently under development, which will also take into account the need to ensure the adequate protection of confidentiality. AnaCredit data collection has been designed to produce a complete picture of the credit exposure of the reporting population. The information collected comprises almost 100 different “attributes” covering various aspects of the credit exposure, such as the outstanding amount, maturity, interest rate, collateral or guarantee, information on the counterparty, and many other things. Access to highly granular loan-level information will be a major step forward in helping policymakers to analyse and monitor credit developments and to assess the impact of their decisions on bank lending. As you know, bank lending plays a key role in the euro area, where the share of loans in the total external financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is considerably higher than in the Anglo-Saxon world, where market financing plays a more important role. Granular AnaCredit data will help us look beyond aggregates and extract the underlying developments. Granular loan-by-loan data will allow us to know the characteristics of specific groups of counterparties involved in each transaction, without of course revealing their identities. This means that we will be able to assess the driving forces behind aggregate developments and distinguish genuine and healthy growth from potential exuberance. This is crucial for policymakers. And, finally, although no data will be collected specifically for supervisory purposes in the initial stages of the project, the information will also be very useful in many areas of banking supervision. I am thinking in particular of the information on the link between lenders and the unique identification of counterparties across the entire lender population. The use of big data in policy analysis Let me now turn to the broader issue of the use by central banks of technology-driven data. An early and prominent example of online data being used for policy analysis is the “Billion Prices Project”, which was launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2008.[12] Today, the project publishes daily online price indices for more than 20 countries, based on a technology called “web scraping”, where price information is collected automatically by machine from hundreds of retailers that also have physical outlets. By 2015, about 15 million prices were being collected every day from 900 retailers. The advantages for policymakers are plain to see. Online inflation data, if of high quality, are much timelier than current price statistics and may cover a much larger number of products. Eurostat currently collects, via the national statistical institutes, roughly three million prices for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices every month in the 28 EU Member States and it publishes the index 17 days after the end of each month.  Online price data can therefore be used to improve short-term forecasts and to check the robustness and reliability of current price indices. Mixed-frequency models, for example, could be used to enhance existing forecast models that are based on monthly data. Sveriges Riksbank has already tested the use of online price data. The results indicate that the data add value when it comes to forecasting short-term developments in consumer prices for fruit and vegetables.[13] Preliminary explorative analysis at the ECB confirms the predictive power of online price data, provided they are sufficiently granular.  This suggests that online prices may complement existing price data. Daily online data can also add significant value to policymaking in periods of high uncertainty. As research has shown, would the full Billion Prices Project data have been available in 2008, the turning point in US inflation following the demise of Lehman Brothers could have been identified months before it showed up in the official US consumer price Index.[14]  Online prices are, however, only one source of potential interest for policymakers. Large-scale barcode scanner data, for example, are an alternative avenue that researchers at the ECB have explored in the past to investigate factors that determine prices and the degree of price dispersion, much in the tradition of our long-standing efforts under the umbrella of the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network.[15] The data, which consist of 3.5 million observations on the price and quantity of individual products sold, have confirmed that competition at producer and retail level is a key factor affecting micro price-setting.  Insights gained from the use of online and scanner data have also encouraged the ECB to make micro-price research a strategic research priority between 2018 and 2020. The first step is to pick up where the Inflation Persistence Network left off, by resuming the collection of micro data underlying the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index and complementing them, where possible, with scanner and online price data.[16] Collaboration within the Eurosystem will once again be vital for the success of this ambitious project. The ECB, with the help of the national central banks, also draws on big data to help improve business cycle analysis. Google search data, for example, have been suggested as a potentially valuable source of data for policymakers. Back in 2012, Hal Varian and co-author showed that Google searches can help predict economic activity.[17]  Building on this idea, ESCB staff have explored the possibility of nowcasting unemployment using volumes reported by Google Trends for a large number of search queries broadly related to unemployment. They find that many of the search terms indeed correlate with unemployment and may reduce forecasting errors by up to 80% by comparison with naive benchmark models.[18] Job search and related Google search quotes have also been found to be strong predictors of variations in subjective wellbeing.[19] Similar initiatives are underway for more leading indicators. Related to this, electronic payment data from credit cards and cash withdrawals from ATMs have been shown to help forecast private consumption as well as GDP growth, provided that they are made available in a timely manner.[20] These data are also less prone to revision than traditional national accounts data. Our internal findings so far suggest that, in some euro area countries, the correlation between payment data and private consumption is encouragingly strong, making their systematic use in forecasting an option for policymakers. Technological progress in exploiting textual information can provide similar benefits. Research shows that information extracted from business newspapers can be used to nowcast quarterly GDP growth and outperforms traditional forecasting methods at turning points.[21]  Similar methodologies can also be used to extract information on how central bank communication is perceived by the public. Specifically, text mining techniques are employed by the ECB to determine whether its communication has been interpreted as dovish or hawkish by the media and to assess its impact in unconventional times.[22] Given the increasing role of communication in determining the monetary policy stance, such analysis may usefully complement the feedback extracted from financial markets.  Challenges in using big data for policy analysis Overall, these examples highlight the fact that big data can help policymakers overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional macroeconomic time series. In short, these are: improved timeliness, richer detail on interactions and the ability to test and develop old and new theories using data not previously available. For sure, big data have also provided plenty of opportunities to deepen our understanding of behavioural economics, and how psychology can drive macroeconomic developments. At the same time, some of the data raise new challenges, many – but not all – of them are related to the statistical production process itself. For example, the sheer scale and variety of big data result in the difficulty of processing unstructured data. The database interfaces used by central banks were designed in the past mainly to handle time series data. Strides have certainly been made to cope with cross-sectional data, such as those used in supervision. But putting in place effective data processing methods and interfaces that permit the retrieval and visualisation of big data represents a considerable IT challenge.  It is also a challenge in term of human resources. When recruiting staff, central banks have not traditionally sought experience with techniques developed to cope with big data. Building up expertise in this new field takes time, and it also involves strategic planning on the recruitment side. But central banks are not the only employers wanting these skills, and competing against the private sector for the limited pool of highly sought-after experts is likely to prove challenging. Apart from these operational considerations, there are also analytical, legal and ethical concerns related to the use of such data.  For example, perennial pitfalls involved in analysing traditional data also apply to big data. One misconception about big data is the common view that we no longer need to concern ourselves with sample bias, as large volumes of data take precedence over standard sampling theory, and that such data provide a census.[23]  Any statistician will know that this is of course not true. Take a dataset that includes all tweets ever made. Despite being a census of tweets, people who tweet are likely to differ in age, preferences and behaviour from those that do not, so several segments of the population are underrepresented, or do not appear in the sample.  Making assumptions about household behaviour without adequately re-weighting the sample is likely to result in biased and inaccurate estimates. Traditional datasets, designed to be representative of the entire population, might therefore sometimes be less subject to sample biases, although they are significantly smaller in size. Similarly, big data also involve analytical challenges related to, for example, econometric identification. This is also referred to as the “curse of dimensionality”, (sometimes called the “large p, small n paradigm”) where there are many parameters but few observations.[24] Dynamic factor models, or Bayesian shrinkage, are methods which can help address the difficulties arising from the high dimensionality of data and, in fact, the term “big data” first appeared in econometrics in 2000 in relation to these models.[25] But some of these methods are still being developed, in particular for cases involving many observations – a situation which we will increasingly face over time as our datasets grow even larger. Furthermore, the ability of big data to link individuals across various datasets raises important questions about privacy and confidentiality. A special Eurobarometer survey in 2015 showed that two-thirds of respondents were concerned about not having complete control over the information they provided online. A quarter of respondents considered it a risk that personal information could be shared with third parties, such as government agencies. With this in mind, the European Parliament in April last year approved the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will come into force in May 2018. This Regulation will provide strong personal data protection, while giving individuals greater control over their own data.[26] But statistical agencies and central banks are already taking serious steps to ensure that privacy standards are fully upheld when they make use of new big data, such as credit card transactions or Google search data. Anonymity in transaction data helps build trust and allows policymakers to leverage new technology to help take better policy decisions for the common good.  Differences in national data protection regulations, in turn, together with differences in data standards, also pose a challenge, in the form of our global ability to collect, aggregate, disseminate and share data. In today’s interconnected world, a global approach to data collection is a prerequisite for developing a coherent view of the global economy and financial system, and for identifying vulnerabilities. But many legal hurdles to cross-border data sharing remain to be overcome, and implementation gaps to be filled, if the intended benefits of the data harmonisation reforms in the financial field are to be fully achieved.[27]  Regulation also plays a big role in decisions about accessibility. Consider the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which will enter into force in a few weeks. One outcome of the new Directive is that banks will soon lose the monopoly they have on their customers’ transaction data.  The implication is that new fintech firms will be able to use these data to design new tailor-made products and to allow real-time access to financial services anywhere and at any time. This can be expected to foster productivity. At the same time, regulators need to be mindful of the potential financial stability implications, in particular if incumbents fail to rise to the challenge, and fintech firms thus start to crowd banks out of a large range of financial services. Granting access to big data therefore also has the potential to shift economic structures.[28]  It even has the potential to change the course of policy. So far, policy has largely relied on data produced by governments, often in the form of abstract concepts, such as GDP.[29] But the more widespread ability to create individual statistics threatens the hegemony of policymakers in defining the parameters of policy. One risk is that individuals will use other, readily available sources of data that could undermine confidence in official statistics and, hence, in the central bank’s commitment to price stability.  Just as there are concerns about “fake news” dominating social media, there is a risk of “fake”, or at least poor quality, statistics driving out better quality ones in public discourse. And just as false reports may quickly go viral, reliance on internet search data in the assessment of the economic situation may become self-fulfilling. Actions by economic agents could become less anchored to actual activity and more prone to manias and panics, with obvious implications for economic and financial stability. The challenges here are twofold for policymakers. The first is to meet the demand for more individually tailored information. Some statistical offices, for example, already offer the possibility to calculate a personalised inflation index using official price quotes, but with expenditure weights provided by the user. The second challenge is to recognise that public perceptions of what we should target may differ from the abstract definitions we employ. Over time, engagement with the public may result in changes to definitions, and even in the conduct of policy. This brings me to my last challenge, which has a philosophical dimension to it. Over time major central banks have tended to become more transparent, in the belief that communication would aid the effectiveness of monetary policy.[30] This has led to growing interaction between central banks and financial markets, simply because communication is not a one-way street. You can see what I’m getting at. New technological advances may create a new “monkey in the mirror” mimetic loop[31], this time not through financial markets, but through big data. That is, we may one day be tempted to draft our monetary policy statements and speeches in the light of how they will be comprehended and interpreted by artificial intelligence algorithms. So in the future big data may work two ways, with central banks acting on, and reacting to, it, with consequences which remain to be understood.  Conclusion Let me conclude. Central banks have made considerable progress in recent years in integrating big new datasets into their policy analysis and decision-making. Granular data collected by central banks themselves have, in particular, become an indispensable source of information for policymakers. Yet, it is probably fair to say that we are still exploring how to use much of the big data that new technology opens up to us. Although evidence is growing that online data may provide tangible benefits for short-term forecasting, more research is needed to ensure that the data are of sufficient quality and reliability to systematically inform policymaking.  The potential of such data to enrich central bank analysis in the future is considerable, however, as are the challenges that come along with it. For this reason, I encourage all of you to continue your efforts and to work in the same collaborative spirit as you have done so far.  Thank you.      [1] See also Tissot, B.

Big data usually refers to unstructured data resulting from non-statistical activity and/or structured data that create operational challenges owing to their size or complexity; see e.g. Nymand-Andersen, P.

(2002), The Politics of Large Numbers. A History of Statistical Reasoning, Harvard University Press.     [3] The ECB started thinking quite early about what policymakers can learn from big data. The first conference it organised on this topic was held in April 2013, marking the start of a series of central banking conferences on big data. In parallel, joint efforts were undertaken by the Bank for International Settlements’ Irving Fisher Committee, which has launched pilot projects covering the internet, commercial and public sources and financial market information.     [4] The two initiatives are based respectively on regulations (EU) No 1333/2014 and No 2016/867 of the European Central Bank.     [5] It is important that individual institutions are not identified either directly or indirectly by the published figures. Following our usual practice, for any aggregate in which one or two banks account for more than 85% of the value, the data are flagged as confidential. Following the collection of data over a number of maintenance periods, it has become clear that there are a number of market segments where such confidentiality considerations apply on a frequent basis. Those considerations have influenced our decision on which aggregates to publish, since for continuity purposes we would like to continue publishing data each quarter for those series we choose to release, without regular gaps caused by confidentiality concerns.

(2017), “Asset purchases, financial regulation and repo market activity”, speech at the ERCC General Meeting on “The repo market: market conditions and operational challenges”, Brussels, 14 November.     [7] There are currently two major benchmark rates in the euro area, both based on the unsecured market. The euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR) is based on quotes given by a panel of 20 banks, at a number of different tenors. The euro overnight index average (EONIA) is calculated on the rates provided by 28 contributing banks on one overnight transaction carried out that day. Interest rate benchmarks play a key role in the financial system. They are frequently used in contracts that are indexed to floating interest rates, which reduces the complexity of those contracts and aids standardisation. This includes the widespread use in derivative markets for products such as swaps, options and forward contracts.     [8] ECB Press release of 21 September 2017: ECB to publish new unsecured overnight interest rate     [9] First, the EONIA relies on the voluntary submission by 28 banks of one transaction each, whereas the ECB’s new overnight rate should go well beyond the current quotient of one rate per bank. The current country representation under the MMSR may justify increasing the number of reporting agents to achieve better euro area coverage. Second, the ECB’s rate may become a borrowing rate, whereas the EONIA is a lending rate. MMSR data show that the number of active reporting agents each day is on average higher for borrowing than for lending via deposits. Finally, while the EONIA is based on interbank transactions only, the use of MMSR data permits the incorporation of transactions beyond the interbank market, including those with government sector institutions, insurance companies and pension funds, and wholesale transactions with non-financial corporations. The requirements of benchmark users will determine which transactions will be ultimately included.     [10] See also Schubert, A.

Since we last met, the ECB Governing Council has taken important decisions on the recalibration of its monetary policy instruments beyond the end of the year.  Therefore, in my remarks today, I will first discuss the outlook for the euro area economy and the recalibration of our monetary policy measures. Then, at the request of this committee, I will discuss the role of TARGET2 in supporting financial integration and the implementation of our monetary policy, which in turn have implications for interpreting TARGET balances. The economic outlook  The economic expansion remains solid and broad-based across countries and sectors in the euro area, mainly supported by domestic demand. According to the recent Eurostat flash estimate, real GDP growth has continued in the third quarter at a rate of 2.5% year on year. This amounts to four-and-a-half years of continuous quarterly expansion, and the latest survey data point to unabated growth momentum in the near term. GDP growth is also increasingly broad-based across countries and sectors. The dispersion of GDP growth rates across euro area countries has fallen to its lowest level since 1997, caused by a general upward convergence.[1]  The labour market continues to benefit from the recovery and the deep and painful employment losses recorded during the crisis have now been offset, at least in the aggregate. The number of people unemployed in the euro area declined from 18.6 million in the second quarter of 2014 to 14.6 million in the last quarter. Relative to past patterns, employment growth has been broad-based across countries and sectors. 16 of the 19 euro area countries have experienced positive annual employment growth since mid-2014 and employment has been increasing in about 60% of sectors, compared with zero in mid-2014. These employment gains, together with increasing household wealth, are supporting the private consumption outlook. Business investment also remains on an upswing, aided by improvements in corporate profitability.  Our monetary policy measures have played a key role in supporting both consumption and investment demand by ensuring favourable financing conditions for euro area firms and households. Since end-May 2014, bank lending rates for non-financial corporations, for instance, have fallen by around 120 basis points and those for households by around 100 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by almost 190 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area.  This improvement in financing conditions has been accompanied by reduced heterogeneity across countries in bank lending rates. For example, the difference between rates for firms in euro area countries most severely affected by the crisis versus the other countries has narrowed by around 100 basis points since mid-2014.[2]  Despite the firm economic recovery, inflation dynamics have yet to show convincing signs of a self-sustained upward trend. Headline inflation was 1.4% in October and is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, mainly owing to a weaker energy component as a result of base effects.  Underlying inflation pressures are still subdued as labour market slack remains significant. The improvements in labour markets that we have observed still need time to translate into more dynamic wage growth.  The ECB’s recent monetary policy decisions  In the light of this economic outlook, at our monetary policy meeting in October, we decided to recalibrate our monetary policy instruments. The re-calibration of our policies for the period beyond the end of this year is meant to preserve the degree of monetary stimulus that is still necessary to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Let me briefly explain the four main decisions the Governing Council took. First, the improved outlook and our growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim allowed us to adjust the pace of our asset purchase programme (APP). Accordingly, we announced that, starting in January 2018, net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Second, as regards our re-investment policy, we stated that the Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. In this context, let me also mention that we provided additional information on the redemption amounts for each component of the APP, as our policy to maintain the stock of our securities holdings and continue to re-invest the proceeds of those securities that come to redemption for an extended period of time has become more important as the size of that portfolio has grown. Our website now reports all the details of the expected monthly redemption amounts for the next 12 months. Third, on policy rates, we kept them unchanged and reconfirmed that we expect our key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. This sequenced ordering of the outlook for our net asset purchases and the policy rate path is a central element of our monetary policy at present. The “well past” condition that governs the policy rate horizon lays out a critical enabling factor for asset purchases to have their full impact. Finally, we decided that our regular refinancing operations would continue to be conducted as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of 2019. This will ensure the continued smooth implementation of monetary policy while also safeguarding favourable conditions in euro area money markets.  As the Governing Council concluded at the end of its last monetary policy meeting, the monetary policy support that we provide today comes from the combined effect of the additional net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets that have been accrued under our asset purchase programme in the past and the forthcoming reinvestments of the maturing securities, and our forward guidance on interest rates. Taken together, these measures will preserve the current financing conditions and ensure the ample degree of monetary stimulus that is still necessary for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%.  Payment systems and monetary policy implementation  Let me now turn to the topic of TARGET balances.  TARGET2[3] is the Eurosystem’s real-time gross settlement system, through which payments in euro can be safely and efficiently processed between banks, both within and across borders. It provides a state-of-the-art payment infrastructure that is used to settle, in central bank money, payments related to a wide variety of transactions, including monetary policy operations, financial market instruments, and interbank and customer payments. Last year, TARGET2 processed a daily average of about 342,000 payments, representing a daily average value of €1.7 trillion. It therefore plays a key role in ensuring the smooth conduct of monetary policy, the correct functioning of financial markets and banking, and financial stability.  By supporting financial integration and the implementation of our monetary policy, TARGET2 represents a cornerstone of our monetary union. In the TARGET2 system each Eurosystem national central bank (NCB) has a debtor or creditor position (a balance) vis-à-vis the ECB, which keeps track of the money entering and leaving each participant country for accounting purposes. The TARGET balances of individual NCBs therefore merely reflect the settlement of cross-border payments executed via TARGET2. Payments undertaken as part of the asset purchase programme are also settled via TARGET2. APP implementation is distinct from that of refinancing operations because it can entail immediate cross-border payments. Indeed, around 80% of total NCBs’ purchases have been by financial market parties that are not resident in the same country as the purchasing central banks, thereby impacting TARGET balances. Moreover, the sellers of the assets purchased under the APP can reinvest the proceeds, inducing a cross-border rebalancing of their portfolio. This phenomenon, referred to as international portfolio rebalancing, can prompt further changes in TARGET balances, following the same logic I have just outlined.  All this notwithstanding, we have seen TARGET2 has been instrumental in the smooth pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the financing conditions of households and businesses.  Conclusions Let me conclude. The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is the best contribution we can make to the welfare of our fellow citizens.  Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the euro area economy to achieve a balanced growth path that can be sustained in the long run. But this is not the only condition.  Achieving a balanced growth path also requires to strengthen the euro area ability to deal with risks, whenever they will materialise. The current economic outlook provides a unique opportunity to reduce the likelihood of severe shocks by strengthening the economic structures of Member States, with policy actions both on the fiscal and structural side.  At the same time, boosting the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) implies also reinforcing our common institutional set-up so as to prevent and manage shocks.  I thus welcome the European Parliament’s role in such discussions and the renewed efforts by euro area leaders and ministers to tackle the issue, as reflected in, for instance, the recent Eurogroup meeting. It is in this spirit that I look forward to the upcoming Euro Summit meeting on EMU governance.  Thank you for your attention. I am at your disposal for questions.

Metéora is a group of rock pillars in Greece at the very top of which several monasteries were built centuries ago. As you can imagine, it is quite hard to reach these monasteries. In fact, until the 1920s or so, the only way to get there was by sitting in a basket which the monks then pulled up. Now the story goes that, one day, a tourist got very nervous half-way up the cliff. He noticed that the rope attached to the basket he was in looked quite old and rather frayed. So he asked the monk who was accompanying him if they ever replaced the rope. “Of course we do,…” the monk replied, “…whenever it breaks.” I don’t have to tell you that this is not how risks should be managed. It is our job, the job of risk managers and supervisors, to be a tad more forward-looking. We have to ensure that the rope is replaced before it breaks. And we have to ensure that proper safety measures are in place should the rope break unexpectedly. But in reality, it’s a bit more complex, of course. With regard to banks it’s not just a rope that might break. There are many different risks that have to be well managed to ensure the well-being of banks. Some risks are quite likely to materialise, others less so. We all have a list of risks in our minds. And I am sure that these lists look quite similar. They might include interest rates that could be too low for too long, a sudden reversal of risk premia, geopolitical uncertainties, non-performing loans and cyber risks. Banks must monitor and manage all these risks. However, we don’t need to discuss all of them today. So, in my speech I will focus on two of them: non-performing loans and Brexit. In addition to that, I will discuss a third topic which is closely connected to risk: capital buffers, and how to calculate them using internal models. Non-performing loans – the need to act In a sense, non-performing loans, or NPLs for short, are risks that have already materialised. Things have already gone wrong. Some creditors cannot service and pay back their loans. The resulting NPLs pose a risk – for the affected banks and for the economy. Only sound and healthy banks with clean balance sheets can reliably finance economic growth. But balance sheets that are weighed down by NPLs are a huge burden for banks. NPLs are a drag on profits; they might also weaken trust in the banks; and they keep banks from lending to the economy. That’s why it is so important to resolve the problem. And we are on the way to doing so. Since 2015, the ratio of NPLs in the euro area has gone down from around 7.5% to around 5.5%. In absolute terms, we are talking about a decrease of about €200 billion. So, things are moving forward. However, in some parts of the banking sector, the ratio is still too high. I realise, of course, that eliminating NPLs is easier said than done. First, it is difficult to sell them – there is hardly any market for them. Second, it is sometimes difficult to resolve them in court. While foreclosure procedures in some countries last less than a year, in other countries they can take six years or even longer. These are hurdles but they must not serve as excuses. On the contrary, if a bank is not able to recover value from the collateral for a non-performing loan within an adequate time frame, it is questionable whether this collateral should be acknowledged as risk coverage. So, the banks need to do more. They must devise ambitious, realistic and credible plans to get rid of their non-performing loans. And now is the time to do it. The economy in the euro area has been growing for more than four years now; we are experiencing a broad-based, solid recovery. This is an ideal backdrop for banks to tackle their NPLs. We published qualitative guidance to banks on that very subject earlier this year. It sets out the ways in which banks are encouraged to deal with non-performing loans. On that basis, we have scrutinised the reduction plans devised by the banks. And we have already started to provide feedback. We have been assessing the banks’ strategies with three questions in mind: how ambitious are they? How realistic are they? And is the governance in order? Regarding their ambition, unsurprisingly the reduction targets set by banks vary greatly, from 3% to 83% over three years. As you can no doubt imagine, we think that some banks’ targets are not ambitious enough. To assess how realistic the banks’ strategies are, we look at the timelines, for instance. In general, we don’t like strategies that simply defer reductions to later years. We also look at potential tools to be used, such as cures, sales or write-offs. Here, we expect the strategies to be well diversified, not just focusing on a single tool. And there is another thing we need to take into account. How realistic a strategy is also depends on provisioning. Does the foreseen level of provisioning support the strategy? Could there be a disconnect between portfolios which are meant to be sold and the associated projected provisioning? Given current market prices, these two elements might not always match. That said, we have observed a trend of increasing coverage. But dealing with NPLs also requires us to look to the future. Once the balance sheets have been cleaned up, they should stay like that.  That is why we have published a draft addendum to our guidance, which is currently the subject of a public consultation. This draft provides transparency for the banks as we lay out what we expect from them in general in terms of prudential provisioning for future NPLs. We are aiming for a structured dialogue. The starting point for this dialogue is defined by our general expectations and whether the bank concerned deviates from them. When the bank provides reasoning and evidence to back up this deviation, there is no need to consider supervisory action. But there might be cases where the reasoning and evidence is not convincing at all, and where we might still regard the provisions as insufficiently prudent. In such cases, we will consider taking supervisory action under Pillar\\xa02. And in that case, we would have a broad range of measures at our disposal. We might, for instance, require the banks to report, in detail, on the evolution of their NPLs; to collect different information; to re-evaluate the collateral taken in to cover the loans; or to apply specific adjustments, such as deductions and filters, to the calculation of own funds. Such actions are nothing new: they are part and parcel of a supervisor’s daily work. We have done a lot in respect of non-performing loans. But that’s our job. It is our job to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector. And who would deny that non-performing loans are among the biggest vulnerabilities? We have to deal with them. And more than that, our actions complement the NPL action plan agreed on by European finance ministers in the summer. After all, it’s not just up to banks and supervisors to deal with NPLs. Governments can and should help too, with a view to repossessing the collateral. In some countries there are no specialised courts or judges to deal with insolvencies, for instance. Also, there are often no time limits for insolvency procedures. All these factors and others slow down the resolution of NPLs, and they could all be addressed by national governments. With a level playing field in mind, we should aim for a situation where court resolution of NPLs works equally smoothly in all countries, and where out-of-court settlements are common tools. Ladies and gentlemen, non-performing loans have slowly built up over the years. So there was hardly an element of surprise. Other risks are different. They linger out of sight for a while, and then they emerge suddenly and unexpectedly. Brexit is the most recent example. Brexit – the clock is ticking As regards Brexit, the main issue for banks has been clear from day one: market access. Once the United Kingdom has left the EU, banks operating from the UK might lose the EU passport. And with it, they might lose access to the European market. And by the way, that is also an issue for European banks that do business in the UK. They keep the EU passport, of course, but might lose access to the UK market. So, once the UK has left, banks that operate from there might have to seek another route into the European market. And the most obvious one is to become part of the European market, that is, to relocate. Likewise, European banks that operate in the UK might have to find a way to maintain market access. And that is a pressing issue, as the deadline is just over 16 months away. So banks should be taking expeditious steps now. But are they? Well, the picture is a bit mixed. First, there are those banks which access the European market from the UK – the “incoming” banks, from our point of view. They are making progress in preparing for the post-Brexit world, although details and decisions are often still missing. That said, there are still some banks, mostly smaller ones, which seem to be delaying their final decision on relocating.  Second, there are those banks which access the UK market from the EU – the “outgoing” banks, from our perspective. Most of these banks have also made plans, which is good. Still, some of these plans remain a bit too high-level, in our view. So, more work needs to be done, even if the circumstances might be challenging. My message to all affected banks is this: don’t procrastinate. No one will wait for you. When Brexit happens you will either be prepared, or not. I advise you to be prepared. And there are a lot of things that need to be considered. Settlement finality, for instance, might be affected by Brexit, because the protection of the EU Settlement Finality Directive regarding the unwinding of transfer orders will no longer apply across the Channel. Another issue is the continuity of contracts, that is, the ability of market participants to continue servicing existing contracts, in particular derivatives contracts, without appropriate permissions in place. Banks should therefore include this topic in their contingency plans. And finally, banks should assess what Brexit means for their recovery plans. After all, it could raise barriers and make certain recovery options less feasible. But Brexit is not just something the banks have to think about. It also raises a lot of questions for us supervisors. And right from the start, we have worked hard to answer all these questions and map out our approach to Brexit. We have to think about cross-border banking groups, for instance. In the wake of Brexit, new banks will be set up in the euro area. And they will most certainly be part of banking groups which are headquartered outside the EU, in a third country. This raises the question of how autonomous the new euro area entities will be. Will they become well-established banks? Or will they end up as shell companies, which are overly reliant on other group entities from outside the EU? And to be very clear: that’s not what we want to see. We expect banks to manage some of their risks locally. They need local staff, and they need local infrastructure. In respect of market risk, banks must be able, in the medium to long term, to trade locally on a permanent basis, and they must have local risk committees. Likewise, they will need to trade and hedge risks not just with other group entities but with diversified counterparties. Against that backdrop, we are currently working on a booking model assessment framework, which will set out what we expect from banks. Naturally, our expectations will follow the principle of proportionality. In other words, large banks that are highly interconnected and conduct complex capital market operations will have to meet higher expectations. But it’s not just booking models that play a role here. I already mentioned the need for local staff. It seems, however, that some incoming banks have something in mind which is referred to as “dual-hatting”. It means that staff members carry out functions in more than one entity of the group. Here, we have some concerns, in particular if dual-hatting includes important functions, extending to that of the CEO. Wearing two hats might cause conflicts of interest and limit the time that can be spent on each. This is even more of an issue when the relevant staff members are physically located outside the euro area. In our view, certain key roles should not be part of such dual-hatting arrangements. In other words, euro area entities must be sufficiently independent from group entities that are located outside the EU. We will not accept shell companies; that’s for sure. We do not see them as banks. And we won’t accept more inventive set-ups either. In order to avoid having to move staff and assets to the Continent, some banks seem to be considering the idea of establishing a subsidiary in the euro area, which would then set up a branch in the United Kingdom. This branch would use the subsidiary’s EU passport to enter the European market from the UK. We have serious misgivings about this. First, the primary reason for establishing a branch should be to serve the market of the country where the branch is based. Then, there are legal issues. Can a third-country branch use its parent company’s EU passport to access the European market from that third country? That cannot be in the spirit of European law. And the subsidiary might just serve as a shell company. As I said, we do view these kinds of design critically. Internal models – setting capital buffers Ladies and gentlemen, I have described a small part of our risk landscape. As you know, the current overall risk landscape is much wider than that. To deal with risks, banks need to hold adequate capital buffers. These buffers serve as a universal protection against potential losses. A bank’s risk-weighted assets should be the basis on which the capital requirements are calculated.  It is the banks who set the risk weights, using their own internal models. So the models have to work properly. And there has to be a level playing field regarding the supervisory approval of these models. You know just how much the processes for approving internal models differed across euro area countries in the past. That’s why we are now assessing all major internal models used by those banks directly supervised by the ECB. This targeted review of internal models, TRIM for short, is a huge project; we are planning to do about 200 on-site investigations. It is probably the biggest project since the health check for banks which we conducted in 2014. What do we want to achieve with TRIM? Well, there are four goals. First, we want to ensure that the models used by banks comply with regulatory standards.  Second, we want to harmonise the way in which we treat internal models from the supervisory perspective. There should be no unwarranted or undue heterogeneity in capital requirements for banks with similar risk profiles, just because they are headquartered in different jurisdictions within the euro area. Third, we want to ensure that the results of internal models are driven by risk and by risk only. They should not be materially driven by modelling choices. And fourth, as a result of all this, we want to confirm that capital requirements are indeed adequate. So, once we have finalised TRIM, and once the banks have addressed all potential findings, capital requirements will be calculated in a more consistent way across institutions. That said, it will take us a while to finalise TRIM. As I mentioned, it is a huge project. Still, we are on track – thanks to the good cooperation with banks and the dedication of our teams. We started our actual reviews of internal models in April of this year. By mid-2018, we will have conducted 120 on-site inspections. We have already launched more than two-thirds of these. As for credit risk, our focus lies on models that cover exposures to retail customers or small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, we also focus on market risk and counterparty credit risk models. But we will also look beyond that. From mid-2018 into 2019, we will assess models that cover low-default portfolios. These portfolios include specialised lending, as well as lending to institutions and to medium-sized as well as large corporates. We will provide more detailed information on this part of TRIM in due course. We have already started to follow up on the cases of non-compliance that we have identified so far in the general set-up of internal models. In particular, we have found issues in model governance that need to be remedied immediately. These are now being addressed in a thorough and consistent manner. And we are working on an update of our guide for TRIM. This update is based on the comments we received on the first version of the guide, which was sent to the banks and posted on our website in February. It is also based on insights from our on-site missions and a horizontal analysis of their outcomes. We will, of course, seek feedback from banks on our updated guide. The part of the guide that is dedicated to general aspects of model governance, for instance, will soon be published for consultation. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Let us return to Metéora. In the 1980s, one of the monasteries served as a location for a James Bond movie, which inevitably involved some stunts. Roger Moore later confessed that he resorted to moderate drinking in order to overcome his fear of heights. Probably not the best approach from the viewpoint of a risk manager. But the really dangerous scenes were done by a professional stuntman, Rick Sylvester, who, at one point, had to jump off a high cliff. But did he resort to moderate drinking to calm his nerves? No. Did he just jump off the cliff like that? No. Instead, the stunt team very carefully prepared the jump, putting in place all sorts of safety measures, mitigating all the risks. Mr Sylvester jumped, the stunt went well and the movie became a box-office success, with prudent risk management playing a hidden but vital part.  Thank you for your attention.

The economic recovery is continuing but inflation developments remain subdued. So, while we are confident in the recovery, we still need a patient and persistent approach to our monetary policy to ensure that medium-term price stability is achieved.  The euro area economic recovery  The euro area is in the midst of a solid economic expansion. GDP has risen for 18 straight quarters, with the latest data and surveys pointing to unabated growth momentum in the period ahead. From the ECB’s perspective, we have increasing confidence that the recovery is robust and that this momentum will continue going forward. There are three factors in particular that suggest this.  First, the major headwinds that were weighing on the recovery in recent years have now largely dissipated, although downside risks still remain related to external factors. For some years global growth and world trade have been a drag on the recovery. Now, we are seeing signs of a sustained expansion. Global PMIs remain strong. The share of countries in which growth has been improving relative to the previous three years has risen from 20% in mid-2016 to 60% today. And this has fed through into a rebound in world trade, which is growing at its strongest annual rate in six years, and may well become a tailwind going forward.  Domestically, a key headwind in the past has been the necessary deleveraging by firms and households. But this is also now diminishing as debt returns to more sustainable levels. For the euro area, gross corporate debt[1] to value added is now roughly back to its pre-crisis level. In vulnerable countries the decline has been steeper. In Spain, corporate debt has fallen from 215% of gross value added in early 2012 to close to 150% today – the same level it had at the end of 2004. Italian firms have seen their debt ratio fall by around 30 percentage points since end 2012, returning to the same level as in mid-2007.[2]  For households, gross indebtedness is also edging down and now stands just below its mid-2008 level. And importantly for the recovery, household deleveraging is now happening largely “passively” – i.e. through nominal growth – rather than “actively”, that is, through paying down debt or write offs. We estimate that the monetary policy measures we have implemented in recent years will reduce the household debt ratio by 1.5% of GDP from 2015 to 2019, and by 2% for firms over this period.  The recovery therefore has not come against the backdrop of re-leveraging in any economic sector. In fact, monetary policy is helping to reduce leverage and produce a more sustainable upswing, which should in turn facilitate further balance sheet adjustment. The second factor that gives us confidence in the recovery is that the drivers of growth are increasingly endogenous rather than exogenous. In the early phase of the recovery, its main motors were falling oil prices and monetary policy.[3] Now, we see more signs that growth is “feeding on itself”, i.e. spending multipliers and endogenous propagation are again supporting activity.  This cycle is most evident for private consumption, which has remained robust even as oil prices have risen by about 30 dollars since the start of 2016. Consumption is being supported by a virtuous circle between rising labour income and rising employment. Employment in the euro area has reached its highest level ever, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate since January 2009.  Importantly, this has taken place against the backdrop of a rising participation rate, which is now 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level.[4] This has been driven in particular by the increased entry of women into the workforce, whose participation rate has risen by 4 percentage points since 2008 and reached an all-time high.  It has also been strongly driven by older people. Since the start of the crisis[5], the participation rate has increased by 3.6 percentage points for people aged 50-54, 13.6 percentage points for 55-59 year olds and 17.1 percentage points for 60-64 year olds. The fact that unemployment has fallen so much while labour participation has been rising is a remarkable success story.  As consumption has strengthened and spending multipliers have taken hold, investment has also followed with a lag. Since 2016, investment has contributed almost 45% to annual GDP growth, compared with under 30% in the two years previously.  The third factor that signals a robust recovery is that the economy may be becoming more resilient to new shocks. This is the result of two ongoing trends.  One is the increasing convergence among euro area countries across a range of indicators. The dispersion of both employment and GDP growth between euro area countries is now at record low levels. The previous divergence in credit conditions has also largely disappeared.  For very small loans – which are a proxy for the financing conditions facing SMEs – the spread between vulnerable and less vulnerable countries has fallen from 170 basis points in mid-2014 to 2 basis points today. For the first time since 2009, loans to firms are moving into positive territory in all major euro area economies. And demand for loans by firms, which at this time last year was still negative in several vulnerable countries, is now positive across the whole euro area.[6]  The other trend is the growing resilience of the financial sector. The total capital ratio of significant banks has increased by more than 170 basis points since early 2015. Their return on equity has risen from 4.4% at the end of 2015 to 7.1% at the start of this year, even as their leverage ratios have declined. All banks have benefited from the upward trend in returns on assets since the start of our monetary policy easing in 2014, although in some cases starting from low levels. Clearly this trend hides some variation among banks, which is largely driven by differences in their business models.  As regards bank profitability, ECB research finds little evidence that our monetary policy is currently doing harm. Net interest income has remained quite stable over the past two years. If there are any negative effects of low rates on net interest income in the future, they should be largely offset by the positive effects of monetary stimulus on the other main components of profitability, such as the quality of loans and therefore on loan-loss provisions.[7]  Low-for-long interest rates might contribute to a build-up of financial risks, and this has to be carefully monitored. At present we do not see systemic risks emerging at the euro area level. If there are some local pockets of risk, the defence lies in micro-prudential and macro-prudential policies, not changing area-wide monetary policy. Furthermore, in such an environment any backtracking on financial regulation would be a mistake, as the pre-crisis experience has shown.  The outlook for inflation and the ECB’s recent policy decisions Despite this progress on the real side of the economy, from a monetary policy perspective our task is not complete, as we have not yet seen a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.  A sustained adjustment is one where the return of headline inflation towards our objective is durable and not just a temporary blip, and it can be self-sustained without monetary policy support. We do now see inflation moving steadily away from the very low levels of recent years, although progress remains incomplete and partial.  Two indicators are important for gauging the durability of inflation. The first is the outlook for growth, since this helps us assess whether inflation will continue to rise as we expect. The second is underlying inflation. This allows us to assess whether inflation will stabilise around our aim once the effects of volatile factors, such as oil and food price swings, have faded away.  The growth outlook is now clearly improving, for all the reasons I have mentioned. But the underlying inflation trend remains subdued. According to a broad range of measures, underlying inflation has ticked up moderately since the start of this year, but it still lacks clear upward momentum. A key issue here is wage growth. Since the trough in mid-2016, growth in compensation per employee has risen, recovering around half of the gap towards its historical average. But overall trends remain subdued and are not broad-based. A number of explanations have been put forward for this.  One is that the effects of past low inflation are continuing to weigh on wage growth. A second explanation is that the relationship between wage growth and traditional measures of slack has weakened in the post-crisis period.  There are many reasons why this weakening may have happened.[8] Slack might be larger than we thought due to rising labour supply or mismeasurement of so-called “underemployment” in traditional measures of slack. Or the relationship between slack and wage growth might itself have changed, due – for example – to a shift in focus by trade unions towards job security rather than wages in view of higher economic uncertainty.  With the continued support of monetary policy that will avoid any unwanted tightening of financial conditions, these factors should slowly fade away. With well-anchored inflation expectations, the effects of past low inflation in wage formation should not be persistent. And as the labour market tightens and uncertainty falls, the relationship between slack and wage growth should begin reasserting itself. But we have to remain patient. A third explanation is that structural changes due to globalisation and digitalisation have made it more difficult for central banks to stoke domestic inflation. But we do not see much evidence to suggest that e-commerce is depressing inflation in the euro area today – at least to extent that we can measure it.[9] The same is true for “global slack”.[10] In fact, as the global economy recovers, the foreign output gap is moving in the same direction as the euro area output gap.[11]  In sum, we are not yet at a point where the recovery of inflation can be self-sustained without our accommodative policy. A key motor of the recovery remains the very favourable financing conditions facing firms and households, which are in turn heavily contingent on our policy measures. An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term.\\xa0  This is reflected in the monetary policy decisions that we took last month. These aim to signal our growing confidence in the euro area economy, while also acknowledging that we must be patient and persistent for inflation to return sustainably to our objective. We decided to reduce the pace of our monthly asset purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion, while extending the horizon of those purchases until end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. This recalibration of our asset purchases, supported by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates, helps to maintain the necessary degree of accommodation and thereby to accompany the economic recovery in an appropriate way. In this sense, the recent decisions follow the same logic as those in December last year when we reduced the pace of purchases from €80 billion to €60 billion.  Our monetary policy influences long-term yields through both its main components: by compressing the term premium, and by anchoring the expected path of policy rates in the future. By accumulating a portfolio of long-duration assets, the central bank can compress term premia by extracting duration risk from private investors. Via this “duration extraction” effect, the central bank frees up risk bearing capacity in markets, spurs a rebalancing of private portfolios toward the remaining securities, and thus lowers term premia and yields across a range of financial assets.  In the past, since the crisis had heightened risk perceptions, the Eurosystem had to purchase very sizeable amounts per month to foster a certain impact on the term premium and on long-term yields. But, as market conditions have normalised and the economic outlook has improved, risk perceptions have declined and the capacity to absorb risk in private portfolios has risen. This explains why we reduced the pace of monthly purchases.  But asset purchases matter also for the signals they entail about the path of future policy rates: the so-called “signalling effect”. In the euro area this effect is reinforced by the sequence in which our instruments are ordered. Specifically, the length of the horizon of our net asset purchases, and the statement that our policy interest rates are expected to remain at their present levels “well past” the end of those net purchases, mechanically affect the time of the first expected rate hike, anchoring the path of expected policy rates over the lifespan of the net asset purchase programme and beyond.  The signalling effect of asset purchases has therefore naturally increased in prominence relative to the duration effect. This explains why our decisions three weeks ago to reduce the pace of purchases while extending the horizon left, on impact, financial conditions largely unchanged. Conclusion Let me conclude. The ECB’s mandate is framed in terms of price stability, as this is the best contribution that we can make to the welfare of citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the economy to be able to grow along a balanced path that can be sustained in the long run. This is the guiding principle of all our monetary policy decisions. With the recovery ongoing, now is the right moment for the euro area to address further challenges to stability. This means actively putting our fiscal houses in order and building up buffers for the future – not just waiting for growth to gradually reduce debt. It means implementing structural reforms that will allow our economies to converge and grow at higher speeds over the long term. And it means addressing the remaining gaps in the institutional architecture of our monetary union.      [1] On a consolidated basis.

      "['2017-11-16', 'Peter Praet', 'Recent economic developments in the euro area', 'Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Febelfin working group of bank economists, Brussels, 16 November 2017', '  Recent economic developments in the euro area   Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Febelfin working group of bank economists, Brussels, 16 November 2017 The ECB has introduced several monetary policy measures since June 2014, which have played a crucial role in supporting the economy and have been demonstratively effective in preventing a period of disinflation from slipping into one of outright deflation. More than three years later, the risks of deflation have mostly disappeared due to the effective transmission of our policy measures to the real economy, which is clearly evidenced by a broad-based cyclical recovery with solid momentum. This lays the groundwork for a return of inflation to below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Overall, inflation developments, despite the solid growth, remain subdued. Convergence of inflation towards our aim therefore remains conditional on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation.  Before focusing more on price dynamics and monetary policy, let me make some observations about the latest economic developments. Real GDP in the euro area has expanded for 18 consecutive quarters, growing by 2.5% year on year during the third quarter of 2017, according to Eurostat – a rate that exceeded our projection at the start of the year. This compares with the latest potential growth estimates for the euro area of just over 1.4%.[1]\\xa0The latest survey data point to a strong fourth quarter. The composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index – which has a high correlation with growth in the euro area – remains above its long-term average and is close to six-year highs. Overall, survey data continue to point to growth in the quarters ahead. Moreover, Eurostat’s Economic Sentiment Indicator is near a ten-year high. The ongoing recovery has led to solid employment gains. The number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7 million since hitting a trough in mid-2013. This means that all of the employment losses recorded during the crisis have been offset. Additionally, the unemployment rate is now at its lowest level in eight years and continues to decline, notwithstanding an increase in labour force participation. Employment growth, together with the gradual increase in employee compensation, supports households’ disposable income and is underpinning solid consumption dynamics. Robust consumer spending is driven by buoyant sentiment, favourable bank lending conditions and the notable progress achieved with respect to deleveraging. The investment outlook is also positive, supported not only by a need to modernise the capital stock after years of subdued investment and an improving outlook for profitability, but also by easy financing conditions as our policy measures have passed through financial markets to affect the borrowing conditions of businesses and their customers. Since the announcement of our policy measures in June 2014, bank lending rates for euro area non-financial corporations have fallen by around 120 basis points and those for households by around 100 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by almost 190 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area. Heterogeneity of lending rates across countries has also fallen sharply. For example, the difference between the average lending rate for firms in countries that were severely affected by the crisis versus other countries has narrowed by around 100 basis points over this period. The pass-through of monetary policy has become more even. Banks are passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers due to the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which further supports these positive developments.[2] The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, which continues to improve in the third quarter according to newest survey results.[3] Furthermore, bank lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, covering the period from October 2016 to March 2017, euro area SMEs have continued to signal improvements in the availability of bank loans. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016. Against the backdrop of this substantial easing of financing conditions, domestic demand has become the mainstay of growth in the euro area, making the recovery more resilient to developments overseas. Real GDP growth is projected to remain above potential growth in the coming years. The strength and resilience of the recovery tends to foster our confidence that reflationary forces will gradually support a return of headline inflation towards a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But inflation dynamics continue to be subdued. After hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last year and stood at 1.4% in October according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. Owing to energy-related base effects, headline inflation rates are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately since early 2017, but have yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Muted wage dynamics are one important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued. These are shaped by many factors. In addition to weak productivity developments, the significant degree of remaining labour market slack is limiting wage growth. When assessing slack, it can prove worthwhile to also look at broader measures than the unemployment rate. The so-called “U6 measure” captures unemployment, underemployment (meaning workers who would like to work more hours) and marginal attachment, namely those workers that are not competing very actively in the labour market, for example because they are not available to start a new job at short notice. This measure currently covers just below 18% of the labour force and is thus considerably higher than the unemployment rate.[4]  We are experiencing a solid and broad-based economic expansion that is contributing to a narrowing of the output and unemployment gaps. But there still appears to be a disconnect between growth and inflation. As slack in the economy continues to be absorbed, reflationary forces will gradually build up and the traditional Phillips curve relationship between inflation and the business cycle should eventually reassert itself. That being said, current estimates of the slope of the Phillips curve still appear to be flatter than in previous times, which could be interpreted as an indication that the relationship between economic slack and inflation has weakened. A mismeasurement of slack (because of structural changes in the labour market) or an unstable relationship between slack and inflation over time could be among the reasons. At the same time, this effect could also result from discrete parallel shifts in the Phillips curve. Such parallel shifts can arise due to temporary changes in wage and inflation mark-ups, or – more concerning from a central bank’s perspective – the incipient dislodging of inflation expectations. While unlikely, an extreme scenario would see the entrenchment of disinflationary developments initiate a downward drift in the Phillips curve and unmoor inflation expectations. Empirically disentangling these factors is extremely difficult, so we need to be mindful of such considerations when discussing the relationship between economic slack and inflation developments, especially in an environment of uncertainty over the anchoring of inflation expectations. Our primary task as a central bank is to ensure that the reconnection of the real and the nominal sides of the economy – what I referred to before as the Phillips curve regularity eventually reasserting itself – occurs at a steady state rate of inflation that is consistent with our medium-term aim. We have not yet accomplished our mission, and so we must remain patient and persistent. In light of this, the October monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In particular, the recalibration of our asset purchases reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim.

      "['2017-11-16', 'Yves Mersch', 'Securitisation Revisited', 'Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2017', '  Securitisation Revisited   Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2017 Today I would like to come back on an issue that has found some of our attention in the recent past: securitisation.  What has happened: Is it part of CMU agenda? It is not helping banks to sanitize their balance sheets more rapidly when there is such a great need? Simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisations Let me start with some good news. The European framework for simple, transparent and standardised or ‘STS’ securitisations was formally adopted by the European Parliament on 26 October. The adoption by the Council is expected soon and will lead to the conclusion of a process that has taken many years of hard work. The STS Regulation is one of the cornerstones of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) project to build a single market for capital in the EU.  Some basic beliefs: At the outset I still consider the Great Financial Crisis heaving at its origin excess built-up of leverage especially short term debt. We should however not condemn wholesale all debt carrying instruments. While we must tackle the stock of legacy debt, the flow of new credit to the economy should not be hampered as it fuels the economic recovery. Therefore, a differentiated assessment of financial instruments is required.  Let me elaborate on the reasons why the ECB is interested in this particular market segment:   First, the ABS market acts as one of the transmission channels of our monetary policy, facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area real economy and, thereby, helping us to achieve our monetary policy objective.   Second, ABS are an important component of the collateral framework of the Eurosystem.   Third, securitisation, when used well, can transfer risk away from the banking sector, which may support monetary policy as it can help banks free up bank capital, allowing them to extend new credit to the real economy.  The reputation of securitisation or asset-backed securities (ABS) has been severely tarnished by the financial crisis, reflecting both the prominent role of ABS involving complex, opaque structures with poorly underwritten loans and the misuse of derivatives.  Moreover, the market was over-reliant on a highly leveraged investor base depending on short-term wholesale funding. Although these practices were more prevalent in the US, the European securitisation market was also impaired. By consequence, all ABS were demonized. The ECB together with the Bank of England were early supporters of a better functioning securitisation market for transactions that comply with the concept of simple, transparent and standardised ABS and duly take into account the lessons learnt of the crisis.  An early intuition was that lack of transparency acted as an obstacle to the revitalisation of the securitisation market. The ECB has made a significant effort to ensure a high degree of transparency in securitisation by promoting the loan-level data initiative.  STS Regulation also requires a system of registration and supervision for ABS data repositories established in the EU. ‘Securitisation repositories’, as they are called, will be subject to the same ongoing governance, technical and operational requirements as trade repositories under the EMIR framework. They will be expected to store not just loan-level data, but also all other information which the Regulation requires, such as transaction documentation. The repositories will be registered, authorised and supervised by ESMA. The ECB will wholeheartedly support ESMA in completing its tasks. So far so good. What about results? It is duly noted, however, that the revival of the European securitisation market is still anaemic. Market-placed issuance is at historic lows. The investor base has not recovered. The EU securitisation markets are impacted by bank deleveraging, unfavourable regulatory treatment and lower relative costs of funding of alternative instruments. Admittedly, the sizeable Eurosystem covered bond purchase programme and long term loan operations have also represented viable funding alternatives for banks.  In this respect, some more patience is warranted. The STS regulation will only come into force in 2019 as various important technical standards still need to be finalised to provide further regulatory certainty which is important for securitisation market development. EBA is for example mandated to develop guidelines to ensure a common and consistent understanding of the STS criteria throughout the Union. As the ECB has argued in its opinion, this is important to ensure legal certainty and efficiency for those interpreting and applying the STS criteria.  While these initiatives are helpful in principle, they do not exist in legislative isolation. We have to be mindful of potential negative spill-over effects by other pieces of legislation. Let me highlight some areas of concern:   First, on a more technical note, under the current European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) securitisation special purpose entities (SSPEs) are classified as non-financial counterparties and accordingly, subject to certain conditions, are not required to comply with the clearing and margining obligation. However, according to the May proposal of the Commission to amend the EMIR framework, securitisation entities are reclassified as financial counterparties instead of non-financial counterparties. Therefore, these entities would potentially become subject to mandatory clearing and margining. This would mean that they have to provide collateral, with regards to their derivatives. This is surprising because securitisation derivatives already contain features to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Moreover, the nature of the securitisation derivatives makes it difficult to comply with the margining or clearing obligation. How can an SPV put down margining as it only has by definition control over its underlying portfolio? How can it post collateral? The STS Regulation exempts STS SSPEs from the clearing obligation, provided that counterparty credit risk is adequately mitigated. Further clarity on this is needed as many European securitisation transactions use derivatives for genuine hedging purposes.   Second, the revision of capital charges for STS securitisations in Solvency II is essential for the recovery of the investor base. An updated calibration should consider the difference in the risk profile and tolerance between insurance companies and banks and the capacity of the STS criteria to capture a lower risk profile in securitisations. The calibration should not incentivise insurance companies to seek investments in the underlying assets in question in an un-securitised, rather than a more liquid securitised, format.  Third, the potential benefits of securitisation are twofold: it can be used as a way to fund an asset and as a means of transferring risk. It can free up bank capital, allowing banks to extend new credit to the real economy. Likewise, the pricing of risks is more effective when securities are assessed by the market rather than being dormant on banks’ balance sheets.  All this may support the transmission of monetary policy, where the bank lending channel may otherwise be impaired.  Finally, it may lower borrowing firms’ exposure to re-financing or liquidity risk, thereby increasing banks’ resilience and helping to contain systemic risk.  For this potential benefit of securitisation to come to fruition it is of course key that the risk transfers are genuine; in other words, it is necessary that the risk is really transferred to third parties. The experience of the crisis showed that this condition was not always met in the past. In this respect, I would like to highlight the important work done by EBA in the assessment of the current supervisory practices and the proposals made to further enhance the criteria of significant risk transfer for securitisation in its discussion paper.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The ECB places great importance on the health of the European securitisation market. The ABS loan-level initiative has made an important contribution in ensuring a high degree of transparency to enable investors to assess the embedded risks of securitisations.  Obviously, ABS had to become safer after the experience of the Great Financial Crisis, in particular with securitized US-subprime mortgages. Regulators and legislators have acted accordingly, and the work has not yet been completed. But we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. Instead, the potential of healthy securitizations should be exploited.  In line with the Commission goal to revive the securitisation market in Europe, in order to broaden investment opportunities for investors and boost lending to households and businesses a number of barriers need yet to be overcome. The STS Regulation could make an important contribution. Much work has already been conducted, nevertheless many important technical standards still need to be finalised and some other uncertainties still remain. In this context, we have to be mindful amid the interdependencies of different pieces of legislation.  Calibration of Solvency II is essential for insurance companies as investors in securitisation. Further clarity of securitisation special purpose entities under the EMIR framework is needed. Finalisation of Basel III may impact securitisation as a means of transferring risk. These are challenges that lie ahead of us.  ']\n",
      "['2017-11-15', 'Peter Praet', 'Communicating the complexity of unconventional monetary policy in EMU', 'Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2017 ECB Central Bank Communications Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 November 2017', '  Communicating the complexity of unconventional monetary policy in EMU   Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2017 ECB Central Bank Communications Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 November 2017 Central bank communication has been fundamentally affected by the fallout from the global financial and economic crisis.[1] Throughout that period, central banks succeeded in preventing a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. To do so, they adopted a broad range of unconventional measures, the functioning of which is very difficult to explain to the public. This applies, for example, to the notion of negative nominal interest rates, which is hard to communicate because it challenges the conventional wisdom that thrift and patience are virtues that deserve pecuniary remuneration. Against this backdrop, I would like to discuss three communication challenges that are particularly relevant to the euro area and the ECB’s monetary policy. The first challenge is to bear in mind the multi-country nature of our monetary union, which requires communication to be tuned to the specific context of different national audiences so as to ensure broad participation in the public debate on euro area monetary policy.  The second challenge for monetary policy communication is to take into account the increasing complexity of monetary policy by ensuring consistency over time and clarifying the state contingency of the policy stance. To ensure consistency over time, it is essential for the central bank to adopt a clear organising framework, centred on the ultimate objective, for the ECB consisting of price stability, and adhering to a state-contingent reaction function that determines how the monetary policy stance adjusts to changing economic conditions.\\xa0As the economic environment that monetary policy faces may indeed be subject to massive swings, state contingency may entail pronounced differences in the monetary policy stance over time. This, in turn, requires careful explanation – in particular in circumstances that call for unconventional measures and, hence, leave markets and the general public without empirical precedent to help them anticipate and rationalise the central bank’s actions.  The third challenge is for the communication framework to provide clarity on the use of specific tools in a multi-instrument context, when the central bank reaction function acquires an additional dimension. In normal times, the central bank reaction function mainly specifies the contingencies for loosening, tightening or maintaining a given policy stance. In unconventional times, it also needs to spell out which tool would provide the first margin of adjustment if a change in policy stance were to appear warranted, and how the adjustment in one policy instrument would interact with the others.  Reflecting the multi-country nature of Economic and Monetary Union To gauge the complexity of monetary policy communication in a multi-country currency union, just consider some of the headlines on the expanded asset purchase programme (APP) which appeared in major newspapers in different countries, both inside and outside the euro area, in January 2015.  Starting from the outside perspective, reports in media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom spanned the full spectrum, with some saying that the ECB’s “bond-buying proposal beats all expectations” and the ECB “gets it (almost) right”, while others felt that the “stimulus may be too little or too late”.  Within the euro area, newspapers in some countries claimed the ECB was a “central bank going the wrong way”, as the APP would fuel inflation and “make everything more expensive”. In other countries the tone was markedly different, with the programme considered “convincing” and conducive to an economic environment in which “there’s no excuse for the recovery not to start”. In addition to this wide range of media perspectives, the crisis has had a profound impact on the way in which the public views institutions. For instance, judging from different Eurobarometer surveys, trust in European institutions, including the ECB, clearly declined during the crisis and has only started to recover in recent years (see Figure 1), while remaining consistently higher than the levels of trust enjoyed by national governments and parliaments. The fall and rise in public trust in turn runs roughly in parallel with the performance of the economy, as reflected in, for instance, the unemployment rate – a point that also emerges from systematic empirical analysis.[2]  These levels of trust often coincide with a disconnect between, on the one hand, the way central banks communicate their policies and, on the other hand, the public’s perception and awareness of the goals that central banks try to achieve and the means by which they operate.[3] As Andy Haldane remarked earlier this year, this disconnect means that we, as central bankers, have to “rethink how and with whom we engage”.[4]   Figure 1: Evolution of trust in different European and national institutions and economic conditions   (net percentages)      Sources:   Standard Eurobarometer No 87  , published on 2 August 2017, and Eurostat.   Notes: The figure shows the net trust in the respective institutions, defined as the percentage of respondents who trust the institution minus the percentage of respondents who distrust it, and the euro area unemployment rate (inverted). The Eurobarometer survey is conducted twice a year in spring (S.) and autumn (A.).   Figure 2: Cross-country dispersion in net trust in the ECB in euro area countries   (standard deviations of survey results across countries)        Source: Standard Eurobarometer No 87, published on 2 August 2017.   Notes: The figure shows the standard deviation in net trust in the ECB across euro area countries for different survey rounds. Net trust in the ECB is the percentage of respondents who trust the ECB minus the percentage of respondents who distrust the ECB. The survey is conducted twice a year in spring (S.) and autumn (A.).  The level of trust in the ECB also differed greatly across countries in the years following the crisis and the dispersion still remains above pre-crisis levels despite some recent declines (see Figure 2). Such widely differing perceptions across countries pose a challenge for central bank communication in our monetary union.  The ECB has sought to address this challenge with what I would refer to as a “two-layered federal structure of communication”.  The first layer consists of a set of “centralised” communication channels through which the ECB discharges its duty to explain its euro area-wide policy conduct to the public and fulfils the accountability requirements vis-à-vis elected representatives as required by the Treaties. These channels include: the introductory statements at the press conferences following the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings, in which the President explains our decisions and summarises the economic and monetary analysis on which they were based; the monetary policy accounts, which report, with additional detail, the deliberations leading up to the Governing Council’s decisions; speeches by Governing Council Members; a panoply of publications bringing together the economic, monetary and financial information that serves as input to the underlying policy assessments; and our public accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament, in the form of our Annual Reports, the President’s testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and our replies to questions from Members of the European Parliament. These centralised communication channels are complemented by “decentralised” communication channels at national level where, in particular, the national central banks of the Eurosystem play an integral role. Equipped with in-depth knowledge of their respective economies, and – literally and figuratively – sharing a common language with their audiences, national central banks are essential in explaining ECB policies to the broader public in their countries. This communication with national audiences is also important given that economic conditions may at times diverge in different parts of the euro area. The national central banks are then well placed to correct the potential dissonance between the rationale of monetary policy actions tailored to the conditions of the euro area as a whole and those that national audiences may consider more appropriate for their own economies. Explaining the common monetary policy stance in a national context is in practice a very challenging task, especially when countries are hit by asymmetric shocks. Reflecting the increasing complexity of monetary policy The challenge for communication to preserve consistency, acceptance and trust across geographies is accompanied by another, no less intricate, challenge: ensuring consistency over time. Central banks’ monetary policy instruments have undergone a sea change over the last decade. The policy-controlled short-term interest rates of the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan dropped from levels between 4% and 5% to essentially zero (see Figure 3) in a relatively short space of time. Since the beginning of the crisis, these central banks’ balance sheets have grown significantly above levels that for decades had been considered typical (see Figure 4).   Figure 3: Key monetary policy interest rates   (percent)      Sources: ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England.   Notes: Deposit facility rate and (dashed) main refinancing rate (ECB), Federal Funds Target Rate (Federal Reserve), Uncollateralized Overnight Call Rate (Bank of Japan) and Official Bank Rate (Bank of England).   Latest observation: 31 October 2017 (Bank of Japan), 6 November 2017 (ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of England)    Figure 4: Central bank balance sheets    (total assets; index=100 in 2007)      Source: ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan.   Notes: The Bank of England’s balance sheet is approximated after 24 September 2014 since the institution only discloses 90% of its consolidated balance sheet after this date.   Latest observation: 3 November 2017 (ECB, Federal Reserve), 27 October 2017 (Bank of England) and 1 October 2017 (Bank of Japan).  Such a profound change in policy conduct requires us to carefully explain that consistency does not mean constancy. Consistency means that we are faithful to our mandate and seek to deliver the monetary policy stance that, given the prevailing economic conditions, maximises our chances of attaining our objective over the policy-relevant horizon. Pursuing our mandate has entailed pronounced shifts in the frequency of policy changes and in the nature and composition of instruments.  What is important, however, is that these shifts are governed by a clear organising framework which: (i) centres on the ultimate objective, price stability for the ECB; (ii) embeds a view on the monetary policy transmission mechanism that maps policy measures with the ultimate objective; and (iii) yields a reaction function that determines how the monetary policy stance adjusts to changing economic conditions. This organising framework provides a way for us to manage the difficult balancing act of responding to material changes in the outlook for price stability in a timely manner, while ensuring that there is sufficient evidence to justify our actions. The key economic rationale for monetary policy communication is to make this reaction function understood by markets and the broader public. It does so not only by announcing the prevailing policy but also by stating the reasons and detailing the assessments that led the central bank to adopt it, thereby allowing observers to more efficiently infer patterns than would be possible without such communication.  Moreover, in recent years, many central banks have gone a step further to make their reaction function more transparent and concrete. Communication on the prevailing policy and the thinking behind it has been complemented by guidance on the future policy course. In providing forward guidance on their main policy tools, central banks have specified the time period over which they expect or intend to preserve a certain instrument calibration and stipulated the contingencies that would warrant a change in instrument calibration.  This innovation in the communication framework has directly served to signal consistency in policy conduct at a time when, first, proximity to the effective lower bound on policy-controlled short-term interest rates might have raised doubts as to the central bank’s options to deliver the requisite amount of monetary easing; and, second, the adoption of new, previously unknown, policy tools left observers without a clear historical reference point to gauge the central bank reaction function. Furthermore, especially in its outcome-based formulation, forward guidance has explicitly maintained the state contingency of policy conduct and established a clear link between the policy objective and the future evolution of policy tools – a consideration that also formed the backdrop for the Governing Council’s decision in October to reconfirm the outcome-based element of its forward guidance on the expanded asset purchase programme, which remains contingent on a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. Overall, our forward guidance framework has left a clear imprint on the market’s ability to gauge our policy intentions. One potential metric by which to measure the effectiveness of forward guidance on key ECB interest rates is the sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news. In the presence of clear guidance on the policy rate path, forward rates which embed investors’ rate expectations should be less reactive – over short to medium-term horizons – to macroeconomic surprises and instead be anchored by central bank communication. Observing this metric over time, it becomes clear that the introduction of our measures – including the forward guidance on policy rates – has been followed by a pronounced decline in the sensitivity of forward rates at the shorter end of the term structure, where monetary policy expectations have the biggest impact, while rates at the longer end have remained around their historical average (see Figure 5).[5] Moreover, the more muted responsiveness that accompanied the introduction of the policy package in mid-2014 also went along with a pronounced flattening of the short to medium-term segment of the forward curve (see Figure 6).[6]   Figure 5: Time-varying sensitivity of the three-month OIS in two years’ (LHS) and ten years’ (RHS) time   (normalised to 1)      Source: ECB. Estimation is based on Altavilla C., Giannone D. and Modugno M. (2017), \"The Low Frequency Effects of Macroeconomic News on Government Bond Yields\", forthcoming in Journal of Monetary Economics.   Note: For each maturity, the blue line indicates the sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic surprises. The yellow lines represent the associated confidence bands. When larger (smaller) than one, the sensitivity is higher (lower) than historical regularities. Vertical gridlines indicate the announcement dates for the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), forward guidance (FG) and the expanded asset purchase programme (APP).   Figure 6: Expectations of future short-term rates in the euro area in periods of ECB non-standard measures   (percentages per year)        Sources: Bloomberg and ECB calculations.   Note: Evolution of the overnight index swap forward curve from pre-negative interest rate policy (black dotted lines) to post-negative interest rate policy (red dotted lines) period.  We have been communicating about our asset purchase programme by disclosing two parameters: the pace of purchases per month, and a date by which the Governing Council could end the net purchases, provided we, by that date, see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim.  This combination of date-based and outcome-based forward guidance has made it easier for market participants to calculate the stimulus being provided each time our programme has been (re)calibrated. The date-based element suggests the minimum amount of stimulus that the programme could be expected to deliver. The outcome-based element – very fundamentally – ties the programme to our inflation aim.  Have market expectations internalised the state-contingent nature of our monetary policy? And which element has prevailed in shaping market expectations: the date-based or the inflation-contingent element?  Market expectations for the likeliest terminal date of the APP have not coincided with the “expiry date” communicated in the most recent programme recalibration, but have instead typically extended beyond this expiry date. In other words: in forming their predictions about the most likely date for purchases to end, markets have not just looked at the date-based element of our guidance. They have also considered the outcome-based element, which allows for the possibility of a purchase horizon extending beyond the expiry date, if that is necessary to attain a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. This, in turn, indicates that the state contingency of the APP has been well understood by market participants. Clarifying the interaction between monetary policy instruments In normal times, central banks adapted their monetary policy stance by influencing the level of one short-term interest rate. In unconventional times, communication has had to cope with the new challenge of explaining the complementarities between policy tools, as non-standard monetary policy has become multidimensional.  To ensure that their reaction function is understood, central banks have to explain how their policies take into account these essential complementarities in the transmission of the individual tools – although this may significantly increase the complexity of the messages they have to convey. In this context, it is perhaps no coincidence that the complexity of the introductory statements delivered at the ECB’s press conferences, as measured by common indices of text readability, has also increased, and started to do so just around the time when we began the latest round of non-standard measures in mid-2014 (see Figure 7).   Figure 7: ECB introductory statements – reading grade level (in years of education; see y-axis) and number of words      Source:   ECB introductory statements  .

The higher the number of words, the larger the bubbles. The curve plots the six-month moving average. The FK reading grade level is calculated using MS Word. Latest observation: 26 October 2017  A multi-instrument policy toolkit is more complex because it adds a further dimension to the central bank reaction function. It not only has to map contingencies with modifications of the policy stance – it also needs to clarify which tool would provide the first margin of adjustment if a change in the policy stance were to appear warranted and how the adjustment in one policy instrument would interact with the others.  This evolution in the policy toolkit has been fully reflected in the evolution of the ECB’s approach to forward guidance in the different phases of the crisis. Forward guidance on interest rates was first adopted in July 2013 as a means to insulate the euro area from the global financial turmoil that had followed the so-called taper tantrum episode a few weeks earlier. This proved to be an effective firewall. But the subdued inflation outlook, as well as other headwinds to the euro area recovery, stemming from, for instance, subdued bank credit, required a more comprehensive policy package. So in the summer of 2014 we launched a complex package of policy measures that were to be adopted in a sequential and state-contingent manner as economic conditions evolved.  Given the essential interaction between policy tools in their transmission to the economy, the ECB accompanied the expanded asset purchase programme that it announced in January 2015 with an adjustment to the forward guidance framework, moving from a previously singular focus on policy rates to a dual approach combining and integrating the different elements of guidance on policy rates and asset purchases (see Figure 8).[7]  Communication about the intended horizon of net asset purchases and the expected future path of policy rates has been a key component of our policy strategy. Our forward guidance on policy rates has acted as an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact. In the absence of reassurances that policy rates would remain anchored around levels close to their lower bound for the entire life of the net purchases, the downward impact of asset purchases on term premia could have been partly neutralised by expectations of rate increases. At the same time, the conditionality attached to the intended horizon and size of our net asset purchases has reinforced the signalling power of our forward guidance on rates.  Figure 8: Evolution of ECB forward guidance framework     Looking ahead, as we progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation and approach the time when net purchases will gradually come to an end, the residual monetary support needed to assist the economy in its transition to a new normal will increasingly come from forward guidance on our policy rates. Policy rates will eventually regain their status as the main instrument of policy, and our forward guidance will revert to a singular approach.  Conclusion Monetary policy communication faces several distinct challenges. It has to be accessible to and useful for a variety of audiences. It has to be consistent in diverse economic circumstances. And it has to clearly convey the central bank’s reaction function, also when the latter entails a diverse set of instruments. To meet these challenges, the ECB’s communication uses a broad range of channels to express the Governing Council’s policy intentions at euro area level and to explain it to national audiences. It has made further efforts to make this reaction function understood by markets and the broader public, not least by providing detailed information on the thinking underlying its actions. And, in recent years, it has made its reaction function more transparent and concrete by adopting an integrated forward guidance framework. We will continue to engage with the general public and to guide market expectations as new challenges arise. This means that we have to continue reflecting and having constructive debates on how to shape central bank communication in the future.

(2013), Explaining EU citizens’ trust in the ECB in normal and crisis times, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 115(3), pp. 781-807. It is also interesting to note that deteriorating economic and fiscal conditions in one euro area country seem to reduce the level of trust in the EU of citizens in other countries; see Ioannou D., Jamet, J.-F. and Kleibl, J. (2015), Spillovers and Euroscepticism, Working Paper Series, No 1815, ECB.     [3] In this vein, see also the evidence in Ehrmann et al. (2013), which indicates that a “higher degree of knowledge about the ECB generates more trust in normal times and even more so during the financial crisis”.     [4] See the speech given by Andrew G. Haldane, Chief Economist, Bank of England entitled A Little More Conversation, A Little Less Action at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference on 31 March 2017.

[6] Given the unique structure of the euro area’s monetary policy transmission mechanism, anchoring the short and intermediate segments of the yield curve around levels consistent with a very accommodative monetary policy stance has been even more critical for the ECB than for other central banks engaging in similar policies.

      "['2017-11-14', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'Asset purchases, financial regulation and repo market activity', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ERCC General Meeting on “The repo market: market conditions and operational challenges”, Brussels, 14 November 2017', \"  Asset purchases, financial regulation and repo market activity   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ERCC General Meeting on “The repo market: market conditions and operational challenges”, Brussels, 14 November 2017 Let me thank the organisers for inviting me here today. [1]   The repo market is a cornerstone in the transmission of monetary policy. In its traditional role, it is a prime short-term funding market for banks. Before the outbreak of the global financial crisis, secured transactions accounted for around a third of the daily turnover in euro area money markets according to money market statistical reporting (MMSR) data. Today, their share is closer to two-thirds. Movements in short-term repo rates therefore change the market-based financing conditions for banks and, hence, their conditions for trading with their ultimate customers – firms and households. This means that repo rates are a prime channel through which changes in the monetary policy stance are transmitted to the broader financial market and the real economy.  In addition, the repo market plays an important intermediation role in the financial system by being the main vehicle for sourcing and financing government bonds. In this role, the repo market critically supports the liquidity of the bond market. It offers investors the possibility to finance long positions and to borrow securities to deliver into short positions. Interruptions in the repo market may therefore affect the entire term structure of interest rates. The implication is that central banks need to have a watchful eye on developments in the repo market to ensure that it transmits and reflects the intended monetary policy stance. This includes monitoring the impact of their own actions on repo market activity, as well as the effects of other, external factors that could potentially drive a wedge between central banks’ own intentions and actual financial market conditions.  In fact, two watchful eyes are not too many, in view of the risks that this market may pose to financial stability. Because repo trades are predominately of a very short-term nature, and secured funding can create a false sense of security when collateral prices are in fact often procyclical[2], excessive reliance on repo market funding may quickly turn into a source of instability for the financial system as a whole. The scars from the great financial crisis are still visible today.  In my remarks today I would like to discuss two factors that have recently been highlighted by market observers, practitioners and academics alike as potentially challenging the intermediation capacity of repo markets, namely central bank asset purchases and post-crisis prudential regulation.[3]  I will show that the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) left a visible footprint in the repo market, but that last year’s modifications to our securities lending facility contributed to restoring an appropriate balance between ensuring the effectiveness of our measures and the smooth functioning of repo markets. I will also provide empirical evidence that challenges the view that financial regulation has adversely impacted repo market activity so far. But I will also argue that further evidence is needed to draw conclusions on this matter.  Asset purchases and repo market activity Let me start with the impact of central bank asset purchases on recent repo market activity. Asset purchases may have two broad effects on repo markets. The first is their impact on excess liquidity. With central banks exchanging large amounts of reserves for longer-dated securities, banks may no longer need to tap the interbank market, both secured and unsecured, to manage their short-term liquidity needs. As a result, trading volumes may fall. The second effect is closer to one of the main transmission channels of asset purchase programmes, namely portfolio rebalancing. In imperfect financial markets, those in need of scarce securities, or those who have a special preference for them, need to bid harder to obtain them, thereby pushing up their price and lowering their yield – which then delivers financial conditions supportive of higher output and prices in the real economy. There is growing empirical evidence that this channel has been very effective in the euro area.[4]  The flip side to this is that, although purchases are conducted in the secondary cash market, price adjustments in this market can also be expected to affect conditions in the repo market. A simple way to think about this is through short-selling. Bonds being richer in the cash market will make it more difficult to borrow them via reverse repos. This should also push up the price in the repo market, all else equal.  In addition, investors who own more expensive securities should be able to profit from them by obtaining lower funding costs in the repo market. In other words, because the cash and the repo market often intermediate the same asset, it is natural that changes in one market may have repercussions in the other.[5]  Both effects have clearly left a footprint in the repo market. But one needs to look beyond aggregate data to understand the full impact of the ECB’s APP.     For example, there has been no overall fall in average euro repo market turnover since the great financial crisis. Daily volumes in the repo market even rose in recent years, despite the considerable increase in excess liquidity. You can see this clearly on my first slide. According to MMSR data, turnover was close to €350 billion daily in the second quarter of this year, up from around €250 billion a few years ago.  What has changed, however, is the type of transaction executed in the repo market. This you can see clearly on this slide and on the next. First, there has been a clear shift from unsecured to secured transactions since the crisis. Second, as can be seen on the next slide, increasing excess liquidity has led to a notable decline in the share of trades backed by general collateral (GC), which is traditionally used to obtain funding for cash management purposes. This may suggest that proceeds from the sales of securities, together with the ECB conducting its main refinancing operations at fixed rate full allotment, have increasingly acted as a substitute for funding in the interbank market.    At the same time, we have observed an appreciable increase in collateral-driven or specific repos. You can see this on the right-hand side. In other words, repos are increasingly conducted as a means to move securities among market participants, not primarily to raise cash.[6]  There might be several reasons for this. Smaller inventories held by market-makers after the crisis, for example, may cause them to source bonds in the repo market more often. Alternatively, short-selling activity may have increased, a phenomenon often observed at, or close to, monetary policy turning points when investors expect yields to rise. One factor that is likely to have contributed to the rise in special repos is policy-induced scarcity, however. This can best be seen when considering the German Bund market. Here, our purchases have absorbed a multiple of net issuance in recent years, meaning that we have actively reduced the stock of outstanding bonds held by private market participants. The consequence is that investors in search of these securities increasingly need to pay a premium, a specialness premium, which, broadly speaking, reflects the costs of the difficulty in finding a lender of the security. The premium will then depend on the scarcity of the underlying asset and their holding structure: many of the residual government bond holders are unwilling to sell them, or will sell them at a higher price due to regulation or their own asset-liability management rules. You can see this on my next slide. Our asset purchases have coincided with a notable increase in the share of German bonds that trade “special” in the repo market, meaning they trade at a premium over GC rates. Before we started our purchases, typically less than 5% of bonds in the German repo market were trading special. In the second half of last year, this share increased to more than 50%. Year-end events, which I will come back to later, pushed their share even higher.    You can also see that specialness did not increase immediately with the start of our purchases under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) in March 2015. The reason might be related to potential non-linearities in the way supply changes affect market outcomes. That is, price effects from the flow of purchases may only become visible the moment supply effectively starts to constrain demand.  Reverse supply effects are also clearly visible on the same chart. When the ECB Governing Council, in December last year, decided to also accept cash as collateral in our securities lending facility, we effectively increased the supply of bonds available in the repo market, thereby swiftly reducing the share of bonds trading special.[7]  The price effects of this decision can be seen on the next slide. Before we accepted cash as collateral, there was a strong positive relationship between the level of excess liquidity and repo rates, not only for trades backed by German collateral, but also for those involving French and, to a lesser extent, Italian securities. The moment we amended our securities lending facility in December last year, the relationship broke down, as you can see on the right-hand side.     Recent ECB analysis confirms the intimate relationship between cash and repo markets and the impact of supply and demand effects.[8] The authors estimate that a 1% reduction in the effective supply may increase specialness, on average, by up to five basis points. Studies for the US market come to qualitatively similar conclusions.[9] In other words, whether a bond trades special, and by how much, depends crucially on its effective supply, which is itself affected by factors such as the amount of investors that are willing to lend out securities in the repo market. These effects are also found to be persistent. You can see this on the same slide. The “scarcity” premium stabilised in spite of continuously increasing excess liquidity, but did not regress. In other words, continued scarcity in the cash market implies that the remaining holders of bonds continue to benefit from lower financing conditions. You can also see this on the previous slide. In 2017, looking through the occasional ups and downs, around 30% of the bonds continued to trade special. The objective of our decision to also accept cash in securities lending was, therefore, not to prevent all instances of specialness. Put simply, this would have meant acting in the cash market or to sterilise bond purchases, which would run counter to our desired monetary policy stance. The present inflation outlook requires financing conditions to remain accommodative for a considerable period of time.  Our objective was rather to support smooth repo market functioning, also with a view to avoiding episodes of extreme specialness, such as at the end of a year or quarter. Extreme specialness may result in serious market malfunctioning, with investors choosing to strategically fail to deliver. It is therefore fair to say that the initial restriction – only lending bonds against other PSPP-eligible securities – was too penalising and is likely to have contributed to the growing specialness premium in the segment of the yield curve where the Eurosystem was intervening most heavily last year. You can see this on the next slide. Purchases under the PSPP in Germany have long been concentrated in medium to long-term maturities due to the restriction, at that time, not to conduct purchases below the deposit facility rate (DFR). Increasing scarcity in that segment of the cash market then also translated into a persistent rise in the specialness premia of such bonds, even when abstracting from year-end effects.     Our decision to accept cash as collateral in securities lending, and to allow purchases below the DFR, contributed to relieving this pressure. Premia across maturity buckets are now broadly similar. The relatively low specialness premia for bonds with shorter maturities, in turn, also suggests that the majority of holders of such bonds – mainly non-euro area investors without access to our deposit facility, as I illustrated in a previous speech – were, and remain, generally willing to provide them in sufficient quantity in the repo market.[10]  Yet, this chart also reinforces the point I made earlier about the flow and stock effects of our purchases: with the effective supply of bonds gradually shrinking over time as a result of our purchases, specialness premia have been persistently inching upwards.[11] While stock effects reinforce one of the key transmission channels of the APP by increasing the “value for money” – the bang for the buck – of new net purchases in terms of their impact on financial conditions, we also need to be mindful that a shortage of government bonds may over time adversely affect the intermediation capacity of repo markets.  There are two reasons for this. First, government bonds are the main type of collateral used in repo markets, primarily because of their safety and liquidity. According to MMSR data, euro area government bonds represent more than 80% of the collateral used. Second, the supply of safe private collateral is necessarily scarce[12], while the supply of safe public collateral has fallen on account of both a decline in net issuance and the downgrades in sovereign credit ratings. For example, the share of euro area bonds rated AAA by at least two rating agencies has fallen from levels around 60% before the great financial crisis to around 20% today. In other words, safe debt is in short supply and debt in long supply is less safe.[13]  This is also why the Governing Council’s decision of 26 October, when it decided to extend the horizon of its asset purchases by another nine months, and to reduce the pace of monthly purchases to €30 billion, emphasised the contribution of the stock of acquired assets, together with forthcoming reinvestments, to providing continued monetary support. Financial regulation and repo market activity Asset purchases are not the only factor affecting supply and demand conditions in cash and repo markets. This brings me to the second part of my remarks. As you know, a number of liquidity regulations affecting banks, such as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), require banks to hold a sufficient quantity of high-quality liquid assets.  At face value, these regulations could be expected to have contributed to bumping up demand for government bonds, thereby reinforcing the effects of the ECB’s APP. But because, as a result of our asset purchases, banks hold a large amount of central bank reserves, which count as high-quality liquid assets, such regulations are unlikely to have been a key driver of increasing collateral scarcity.  These reforms, however, are likely to have affected the repo market in different ways. One of them you can see on my next slide. Here I show the distribution of repo market activity for one-day tenor contracts exchanged bilaterally or via central clearing counterparties (CCPs) for German collateral. The chart shows an interesting feature, namely that the market attaches a premium to centrally cleared transactions.     The reasons for this are unlikely to surprise you: the leverage ratio allows for offsetting cash proceeds to be netted off when the transactions are with the same counterparty, have the same end date, and are conducted in the same settlement system. This means that although repo transaction are not part of the 2009 Pittsburgh central clearing mandate, which covers OTC derivatives, centrally cleared transactions have a premium because they make those trades less capital intensive compared with non-nettable ones. According to MMSR data, around two-thirds of repo transactions are already cleared centrally. So, what we seem to have observed so far is that the leverage ratio – contrary to much-voiced concerns – has not led to a reduction in repo volumes, but rather to a change in the way trades are settled. And to the extent that these trades are increasingly intermediated through CCPs, this is clearly a positive development. CCPs reduce counterparty and systemic risks and help clearing members economise the use of scarce collateral.[14] There is also empirical evidence that clearing increases market resilience in periods of stress.[15]  Resilience of trading volumes to regulatory reforms is also confirmed by empirical analysis conducted by ECB staff – the results of which will be published in the ECB’s financial stability review on 29 November. I\\xa0will offer a short preview today. In this report, ECB staff assess the effects of recent regulatory reforms on repo market developments at quarter-end, based on supervisory data for a sample of more than 50 banks directly supervised by the euro area’s single supervisor. Micro data are important to ensure that aggregate repo market developments do not mask a significant impact of regulatory reforms at the individual bank level.  The findings suggest that, although banks’ adjustments to higher leverage ratios seem to be somewhat correlated with a reduction in their repo volumes, the effects are not found to be economically meaningful relative to other exposures. Other regulatory measures, such as the LCR or the NSFR, are found to have had no statistically significant impact so far on repo volumes. The study also highlights that the more significant falls in banks’ outstanding repo volumes at year-end are likely to have also been driven by additional factors, such as contributions to the single resolution fund or national bank levies. These findings are not the final word on the matter, of course. The repo market is in a state of transition as the report by a study group of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), chaired by Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe, recently concluded. In this respect, the CGFS also recommended in April that a further study on repo markets be undertaken within the next two years. This means that policymakers will continue to closely monitor developments in repo markets and financial markets more generally. Some effects can only be thoroughly assessed once the reforms have been implemented more meaningfully, while others may become clearer at an earlier stage. For example, it seems undisputable that regulatory reforms have contributed to temporary volatility in repo market activity on reporting dates.  Specifically, window-dressing behaviour of banks appears a likely unintended effect of regulation. I would therefore encourage further analysis of methods that could help reduce volatility and thereby contribute to a smoother functioning of markets. In this respect, you will have seen in a recently published Opinion of the ECB on, inter alia, amendments to the EU Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), that the ECB supports the review of the calculation method for the leverage ratio.[16]  I have also previously voiced support as CPMI Chair for implementing the leverage ratio in a way that does not create disincentives for centrally cleared transactions, namely by offsetting the initial margin in the case of derivative exposures related to client clearing.[17]  All these exercises, however, should not be mistaken for tolerance of a relaxation of regulation. Post-crisis reforms aim to curb excessive leverage and reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and for good reasons. This is also why the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published specific recommendations, including a framework for minimum haircuts for securities financing transactions (SFTs).[18]  The FSB has also assessed the potential financial stability risks related to collateral re-use in SFTs.[19] The latter may contribute to a build-up of leverage and increase interconnectedness among market participants. The FSB concluded that regulatory reforms, in particular the leverage ratio and the liquidity requirements, are important to mitigate these risks. This means that the implementation of the Basel III reforms will have effects on repo markets, as intended. These might look undesirable from an institution-perspective but they will have system-wide benefits.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The repo market is undergoing significant change. Regulation is forcing market participants to re-examine the extent of their engagement and make more efficient use of their balance sheets. This adjustment process coincides with central banks worldwide adopting a series of unconventional monetary policy measures that have also affected the nature and scope of repo market activity.  Some of these effects will prove temporary, others more permanent. Their full impact can only be assessed in earnest once markets have fully transitioned to their new steady state. From a central bank perspective, it is important to ensure that our own measures do not adversely affect the intermediation capacity of repo markets. Our decision in December last year to also accept cash as collateral in our securities lending facility has proven very effective in this respect. It contributed to mitigating risks of extreme specialness, while preserving the effectiveness of our policy measures in the pursuit of our price stability objective.  At the same time, a high degree of persistence in repo specialness lends support to the idea that the stock of securities already held by the ECB is likely to be a powerful channel through which our measures can help preserve accommodative financing conditions, even after the end of our net asset purchases.

[7] Securities purchased under the PSPP have been made available for securities lending in a decentralised manner by Eurosystem central banks since 2 April 2015. As of 8 December 2016, Eurosystem central banks have the possibility to also accept cash as collateral in their PSPP securities lending facilities without having to reinvest it in a cash-neutral manner. The aim of securities lending is to support bond and repo market liquidity without unduly curtailing normal repo market activity. The Eurosystem is primarily targeting market participants with market-making obligations and is monitoring the securities lending activities closely so as to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the arrangements. In September 2017, securities on average worth €60 billion were lent out by the Eurosystem, of which around €15 billion were lent out against cash as collateral.

While the former stabilised, the latter continued to increase.     [12] Ongoing efforts to recreate safe, transparent and consistent securitisation may, to some extent, support the supply of safe private collateral.

Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Banking Supervision, Resolution and Risk Management Conference during 20th Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt, Germany, 14 November 2017 “What next in banking supervision and resolution?” is the title of this panel discussion. Well, before we discuss what comes next, let us take a quick look at what has happened in recent years. Since 2014, we have built European banking supervision from scratch. We have hired people, devised methods and set up processes. There are certainly still things that need to be improved, but by and large the system runs smoothly. As that is the case, there will be less construction work to be done in the years ahead. But this doesn’t mean that we will sit idly by, quite the opposite. The banking sector is facing a whole range of challenges, as you well know, and we have our part to play. Let me mention a few points – and it’s not a comprehensive list. There is the banks’ search for profitability and their need to cut costs and adjust their business models. There is Brexit. There is digitalisation and there are cyber risks. There are the Basel III reforms, which need to be finalised and then implemented. And there are efforts to further strengthen proportionality. I could go on, but allow me to focus on just one of the core topics which the banks – and we – have to deal with: non-performing loans, NPLs for short. Most NPLs are legacy issues. European banking supervision has, so to speak, inherited them. It’s a major problem that we have to tackle – or rather, the affected banks have to. For them, the non-performing loans weigh on profits; they require provisioning, and they are a constant drain on banks’ human resources, which could be put to more profitable use. And NPLs undermine trust – to what extent do markets trust a bank with a balance sheet that is considerably impacted by NPLs? In other words, non-performing loans make the affected banks weaker and keep them from lending to the economy. Banks which manage to forcefully address this legacy can focus on the future and attract new investors and new business, instead of forever having to look to the past. These banks can do their job: finance the economy. That makes it imperative to sort out NPLs. And there has been quite some progress on this front. Since 2015, significant banks in the euro area have brought down their non-performing loans by almost €200 billion; from €989 billion to €795 billion. That said, NPLs are still too high in parts of the banking sector. That is why banks have to act. And times could not be better. We can look back at 18 consecutive quarters of economic growth; this is a robust, broad-based economic recovery.  Now is the time to sort out the issue of non-performing loans. Banks need ambitious yet realistic plans to deal with their stocks of NPLs. And they need the right governance for these plans. Earlier this year, the ECB published its “Guidance to banks on non-performing loans”. Along these lines, and as part of our supervisory dialogue, we take a close look at the banks’ ability to manage their NPL stocks. We then scrutinise the plans devised by the banks to reduce those stocks. We will start providing our feedback later this month. Banks have to carefully consider how they will react should any performing loans happen to become non-performing. So, with the future in mind, we have to ensure that the problem of NPLs does not recur. New NPLs should therefore be conservatively provisioned within a reasonable period of time. This would serve to strengthen the balance sheets of banks, enabling them to focus on their core business. That’s why we have drafted an addendum to our guidance on non-performing loans. It sets out how we expect banks to provision for future NPLs. The main goal is to have timely provisioning, which should prevent new NPLs from becoming a problem with systemic implications. But let me say that while our expectations are firm, there are no automatic actions attached to them. We will discuss with each affected bank individually why it is not fully provisioning for loans which have been non-performing for several years. Only if the results of this structured dialogue do not convince us will we consider Pillar\\xa02 measures. We have followed this path before, for instance with our  recommendation on dividend distribution policies  and the  Asset Quality Review . The addendum to our guidance on non-performing loans explains our methodology and is currently the subject of a public consultation. This consultation will increase transparency for banks, and the public, and it will help to ensure a level playing field. So, while it is ultimately up to the banks to deal with NPLs, we supervisors play a role too. It’s our job to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector. NPLs are probably the single biggest challenge – and of course they are a drag on the entire economy. And while I am convinced that the ECB has led the way with its work on NPLs, we are not the only ones who can and should take action. European finance ministers agreed, in July this year, on an action plan to tackle NPLs. Also, national governments can help to resolve the NPL problem by reforming their legal and judicial systems. In some countries, it can take quite a long time to recover NPLs in court. This is something that can only be addressed at national level by national governments. NPLs are a joint problem, and we need to make a joint effort to resolve it. Each party has to play a role: banks, supervisors and politicians. In line with our mandate, we supervisors have done and will continue to do what is necessary. Thank you for your attention.

At its last meeting on 26 October, the ECB Governing Council decided to substantially reduce its asset purchases. However, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary in order for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build-up and support headline inflation over the medium-term. The recalibration of our asset purchases reflects growing hope in the gradual convergence of inflation towards our inflation objective, on account of the increasingly robust and broad-based economic expansion, an uptick in measures of underlying inflation and the continued effective pass-through of our policy measures to the financing conditions and the real economy. In my remarks today, I will reflect on the broad-based improvement in the general economic and financial situation that has allowed such significant recalibration. I will argue that this improvement illustrates, among other things, the appropriateness of the monetary policy that we have undertaken in the past years. In this perspective, I will focus on the euro area as a whole as well as more disaggregate developments in some countries. Finally, you certainly cannot expect a central banker to end without a note of caution. In the last part of my speech I will therefore focus on the challenges we are still facing.  Let me start with a description of the current economic developments. The euro area economy is experiencing a broad-based, robust and resilient recovery, and this recovery is underpinned by the monetary policy measures introduced by the ECB since June 2014. However, despite these favourable growth dynamics, inflation developments have been subdued. At the same time, financial stability risks seem contained.  Sustained recovery  The euro area has been expanding for the past four years and the recovery has gained momentum. The GDP in the euro area has finally reached a level above that in 2007, 10 years after the crisis. Robust economic activity is further being translated into a substantial amount of job creation. Despite the unemployment rate still being too high, almost 7 million more people are now employed in the euro area than in mid-2013, which implies that the employment losses recorded during the crisis have been offset. This stands in contrast to the largely jobless recovery of 2010 and is another indication of the sustained recovery in the euro area. The improving labour market combined with increasing household wealth, strong consumer confidence and favourable financing conditions are supporting robust private consumption. Investment prospects also look promising, which reflects both the need to make up for forgone investment in previous years as well as the highly accommodative financing conditions which have been passed through to lower borrowing costs for euro area firms. Business investment is now slightly above the 2007 level. Forward-looking indicators transmit a similarly positive message: business confidence is at a decade high, and survey data point to continued growth in the period ahead. Broad-based, convergent recovery Over recent quarters, the economic recovery has also become more broad-based across euro area countries and the different sectors of the economy.  In fact, all euro area countries, for the first time since 2007, are now enjoying positive real GDP growth in annual terms. The convergence of cyclical growth is reflected in the fact that member countries growth rates were never so close to each other since the inception of monetary union.  Moreover, unemployment rates have receded almost everywhere across the euro area. Despite the fact that unemployment is still too high in some countries, notably as regards young people, it is worth mentioning that it came down the most in several of those countries where it had previously been especially high. Contribution from the accommodative monetary policy of the past years  We recalibrated our policies following the positive economic outcomes, but these outcomes would not have materialised, at least not to the same extent, without the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy. When calibrating its monetary policy instruments, the Governing Council forms a view on the degree of accommodation that is necessary to achieve its price stability objective. Concretely, our monetary policy measures have supported economic growth and the reduction in unemployment in a variety of ways. First and foremost, they have supported domestic demand and have facilitated the deleveraging process in the aftermath of the crisis. The recovery in investment also benefitted from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability.  A precise quantification of the contribution of monetary policy to the current economic recovery is difficult, but current estimates suggest that the measures undertaken have been highly successful. Recent ECB staff estimates indicate that our monetary policy measures are contributing to an increase in the euro area GDP of around 1.7 percentage points, cumulatively over the period 2016-2019. This contribution is well above monetary policy’s contribution to the two previous euro area recoveries in 2003Q2-2006Q4 and 2009Q3-2011Q3. The effectiveness of monetary policy is also reflected in the way our decision to reduce our monthly purchase of securities by half was smoothly received by the financial markets. In spite of the restrictive nature of the decision, bond yields hardly moved and some even came down, while the exchange rate slightly depreciated. This was the result of our cautious preparation and communication, as well as from the ongoing positive growth momentum.  Looking ahead, the growth rate, unemployment, the labour market, the survey data, all provide positive indications that we are moving towards a shrinking output gap as well as an improving labour market. These will eventually produce higher nominal wage growth and thus higher inflation. But we know that this process still relies significantly on our monetary policy support. It is not yet self-sustained and therefore we must be patient and persistent.  Deflation risks diminished, inflation risks remain subdued  Every policy entails risks. Several concerns have thus been expressed about possible collateral consequences of our policy. Such concerns have however not materialised in real facts and we can now underline the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.  Firstly, our monetary policy measures were not an “experiment” on the economy, but were in line with the policies previously adopted by other major central banks. Interest rate paths and balance sheets of the ECB and the FED are broadly comparable, despite the longer and slower economic recovery of the euro area after the crisis. Secondly, much-feared inflationary pressures have not materialised, nor can they be foreseen in the immediate future. Measures of underlying inflation have ticked up only moderately in recent months, and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium-term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wages. Domestic cost pressures, notably from labour markets, are still subdued. The strong worldwide reflationary phase that seemed likely at the beginning of the year has not materialised. Overall, price pressures are still muted and the path of inflation remains conditional on continued support from monetary policy.  Finally, there were concerns that the ECB monetary policy could pose risks to financial stability and provoke excessive asset price increases. Clearly, this did not materialise as there are no generalised asset overvaluations in the euro area. In various countries, some restricted regional pockets of real estate price buoyancy are being dealt with targeted macroprudential measures.  It is against this overall positive background that the ECB Governing Council has decided on a re-calibration of its instruments, with a view to safeguarding the monetary policy impulse that is still necessary to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, in a way that is consistent with our monetary policy aim. All countries have benefited from the recovery An important feature of the recovery is that all member countries have benefited from the recovery and have seen an improvement in their economic fundamentals. The enormous credit flows from banks in core countries to their peers in the periphery, fuelled economic overheating with housing price bubbles in some cases and generalised high external deficits in the run-up to the crisis. The financial crisis then led to significant fiscal deficits when governments had to assist domestic banks. Notably, since the inception of the financial crisis, those countries have undergone a significant adjustment path, in some cases supported by EU/IMF financial assistance programmes. When we compare today with the situation in 2008, we see an impressive adjustment along several of the main economic variables. Fiscal deficits have been significantly reduced and in those countries the primary fiscal balance is now positive. At the same time, their current account balances have adjusted by more than 12 percentage points from an average of -10 percent of GDP to a surplus of nearly 2 percent at the end of last year. This adjustment has been facilitated by a significant recovery from the losses in competitiveness experienced before the crisis. Unit labour costs of these countries have, on average, been reduced by nearly 10 percent over these years. In turn, this adjustment has been enabled by significant reforms of countries’ labour and product markets by allowing more resources to be used in the tradable sectors and increasing the adaptability of their economies at large. Overall, both ECB and IMF estimates show that the current account adjustments are, to a large extent, of a structural nature and not just cyclical. They are therefore likely to be sustained as the economic recovery of the euro area continues.  The general improvement in economic fundamentals also applies to member states that were less severely affected by the crisis. Given the location of my speech today, let me look particularly at Germany. Having been the “sick man of Europe” in the early 2000s, the German economy has become today’s engine of the euro area economy. Moreover, growth has recently become increasingly domestically driven. This has clearly also facilitated the recovery in the other euro area economies, via higher German import demand. Concerning inflation, fears that our accommodative monetary policy could boost excessive inflation in Germany have clearly not materialised. Headline inflation has picked up this year from the very low level of 0.4 percent last year. Most of this increase resulted from the significant pick-up in oil prices. Underlying price pressures in Germany by contrast, have remained subdued, as indicated by the rather stable core inflation rate.  The increase in house prices may be more of concern, particularly in some of the biggest cities, but there is so far no evidence of broad-based excessive house price valuations in Germany as a whole. Strong economic growth demonstrates that Germany is the member state that, after Ireland, shows the highest increase in income per person since the beginning of the euro. At the same time, the present unemployment rate is the lowest in the last 37 years and is well below the European average.  Challenges ahead  Let me summarise. We are witnessing a sustained economic recovery in the euro area as a whole and in all its member states. In particular, countries under financial assistance programmes have been implementing significant policy measures to improve their resilience and competitiveness. Many of these reforms will support potential growth but they tend to exert their full impact with a considerable lag. In any case, such measures have increased the resilience of member states’ economies and of the euro area as a whole.  At the same time, these positive developments should not lead to complacency. Inflation, which is the core of our mandate, is still below our target after four years of growth supposedly above potential. We are not yet fulfilling our mandate and that is why monetary policy will have to continue to be very accommodative, assuring favourable financial conditions to foster growth and spur wages and prices. On the other hand, vulnerabilities and challenges remain in many euro area economies. Unemployment rates have indeed come down, but in particular the number of young and long-term unemployed is still unacceptably high. Moreover, despite an adjustment of flow variables, such as the absence of excessive credit growth, lower budgetary deficits and improved current account balances, the legacy of the crisis is still visibly expressed in high stock imbalances, namely the high indebtedness of the private and public sector across many euro area countries. These high debt levels make the countries vulnerable to adverse shocks. Furthermore, the crisis has also interrupted the progress of real convergence in the more vulnerable economies towards higher living standards. Negative divergences in personal income levels in relation to the euro area average have again increased. Higher and more sustainable growth potential requires decisive policy actions. At the national level, many structural and institutional reforms are still needed to safeguard and improve the future functioning of countries’ economies and thereby the euro area as a whole. We should also review the way in which national policies are currently co-ordinated in the EU. Both the Five Presidents Report on “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union” (2015) and the recent EU Commission paper on the “Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union” (2017) provide guidance on the way to proceed. It is nevertheless a sign of the times that the EU Commission felt compelled to reduce the ambition of its proposal regarding the European deposit guarantee scheme[1], a significant component of the banking union. This just indicates that there are understandable but relevant uncertainties about the future. Any agreement about the evolvement of European integration is a difficult endeavour as it implies the involvement of all member states as well as their respective public opinion. Some of the possible issues at stake are indeed sensitive and could generate instability if not carefully assessed. This provides another reason to take into account the concerns of all member states.  It is however also true that the present favourable economic environment, should be used to make progress in reinforcing the economic and monetary union resilience. This corresponds to the common interest of countries made closely interdependent by the single currency. Reforms at national and EU level will be crucial to improve resilience to shocks, increase growth potential and ultimately restore a path of real economic convergence among member countries. Thank you for your attention.

I spoke last year about the systemic importance of central counterparties, and their importance, in particular for monetary policy transmission. I spoke about how the growth of these infrastructures means that the existing regulatory framework will need to be enhanced, to address the increasing risks posed by CCPs.  I also spoke of how the prospect of the UK’s exit from the EU creates uncertainty regarding the future of the regulatory and supervisory framework for non-euro area CCPs that clear significant amounts of euro currency. There have been very significant developments at EU level since I spoke about this topic last year. The most notable development has been the Commission’s proposal from June of this year to amend the EMIR framework for the supervision and regulation of EU and third country CCPs. We strongly welcome the proposals to strengthen the role played by the central banks of issue of the EU in the regulatory framework, as the authorities responsible for the implementation of monetary policy. This strengthening is necessary in light of two major trends of the past few years.  First, since EMIR first entered into force there has been a continued growth of central clearing and resulting financial risk concentration in CCPs. This has significantly increased the potential disruptive effects that CCPs can have on the implementation of our monetary policy.  Second, the UK departure from the EU implies that a very large part of euro-denominated clearing activities across all asset classes may be performed from outside the EU in the future. While central clearing is undeniably a global industry, the range of euro-denominated asset cleared outside of its monetary zone is unparalleled for any other major currency around the world. This clearly points to the need to strengthen the EU regime for third country CCPs and to enhance in this context also the role of the relevant central banks of issue. As distinct from the need to strengthen the role of the central banks of issue serving a monetary policy purpose, it is also fully justified to seek to strengthen the supervisory regime for CCPs Take the case of third country CCPs: until now, the EU’s approach towards third country CCPs, including those that are of systemic importance, has been to rely entirely on the supervision carried out by home authorities. Deference to home authorities should continue to be the norm in those areas where rules are fully equivalent. However, there are certain areas in which EU rules provide more protection than those in other jurisdictions, and in these areas the Commission is right to suggest that reliance on home authorities may not be enough, and that more direct involvement by EU authorities is required. This is the same approach as currently followed by certain other major jurisdictions.  Where the approach proposed by the Commission may differ is that it also foresees that under extreme circumstances, certain systemically important third country CCPs might not be authorised to operate from outside the EU, and would be required to establish themselves within the Union if they wish to continue providing services to EU counterparties and markets. EU authorities acknowledge that such a decision would have important consequences on market structure. However, as I mentioned earlier, for no other major currency are so many systemic asset classes cleared outside of its own monetary area. The requirement, proposed by the Commission, for CCPs to be established within the EU would function as a last resort measure, to be triggered in the event EU authorities cannot control the risks to their mandates through other means. The ECB would be involved in the process in order to share its liquidity considerations as a monetary policy authority, but the final supervisory decision would be within the hands of the Commission and the Union legislators.  Another aspect where the proposals might differ somewhat from the approach taken in certain other major jurisdictions is the larger role given to central banks of issue. In this respect, it should be noted that a comparable role has been given to the US Federal Reserve in respect of systemically important financial market utilities, including CCPs. This is entirely justified: enhancing the role of central banks is absolutely essential considering just how critical CCPs have become for the smooth conduct of monetary policy. Indeed, disturbances affecting a CCP can cause significant liquidity strains for banks. This can directly affect the central bank’s ability to implement monetary policy and can impact the smooth functioning of payment systems.  In addition, a crisis affecting a repo CCP can disrupt the functioning of the money market, thereby impairing the channels through which central banks conduct monetary policy operations.  Furthermore, disruptive changes to CCP risk management (e.g. sudden collateral haircuts) can generate asset price volatility and affect the central bank’s ability to implement monetary policy.  Finally, a potential decision to allocate liquidity for financial stability purposes outside the currency area would affect the monetary policy stance of the central bank inside the currency area.  This is the reason why, in the event of a severe crisis, emergency financial assistance by euro area national central banks is always subject to a non-objection procedure by the ECB to preserve its monetary policy objective. This brief overview shows the significant impact the malfunctioning of a major CCP clearing significant amounts of euro could have on the conduct of monetary policy. At the same time, allow me to stress that the Commission proposal does not entail that central banks of issue would duplicate the work of supervisors. On the contrary, the role ascribed to them is a limited and targeted one, centred on the aspects of CCP risk management that are most essential for the fulfilment of their monetary policy mandates. This is also why third country CCPs and their home authorities need not be concerned about potential overlaps between EU supervisors and central banks: each will play a well-defined role in the regulatory framework, under their respective statutory responsibilities.  In order to play the greater role foreseen for central banks under the legislative proposal, the ECB’s Governing Council unanimously adopted a recommendation to amend Article 22 of our Statute.  I would like to emphasize here that any potential regulatory actions of the ECB could only be taken within the limits ascribed to us by the Treaty – i.e. the implementation of monetary policy – and would be subject to stringent internal governance controls as well as full judicial review. The role that we would fulfil is not a supervisory one – this is the task conferred upon the national competent authorities and ESMA. Our involvement would be fully focused to the specific responsibilities with which we are tasked as a monetary authority.  Likewise, the Union legislators or the Commission could only adopt measures within the limits of their tasks under the Treaties, focusing on the field of CCP supervision, and their objectives of ensuring financial stability and achieving the harmonisation of the internal market. This would be essential to avoid overlapping or contradictory measures. After all, these objectives are distinct but complementary to the objective of price stability.  Further issues regarding FMIs arising from Brexit  The withdrawal of the UK from the EU will, needless to say, create legal uncertainty not only for CCPs but, also, for other financial market infrastructures, including payment and securities settlement systems processing euro-denominated transactions. These issues need to be carefully monitored and assessed, and solutions may need to be explored in order to ensure certainty and stability.  By way of example, the EU’s Settlement Finality Directive provides that only payment, clearing and securities settlement systems governed by the law of an EU Member State may be ‘designated’ by Member States, and only such ‘designated’ systems may benefit from the finality protections under the SFD. Systems governed by the law of a third country are not eligible for designation under the SFD, and will not benefit from those protections. As a result, if EU participants in a third country system were to become insolvent, the courts could, based on their national insolvency laws, and depending on whether or not their national legislator has activated the option provided for in Recital 7 of the SFD, require the unwinding of transfer orders that they have entered into the third country system, thereby undermining the system’s integrity and affecting other participants in that system. Regulatory accommodations may need to be made, to mitigate the adverse effects of the loss of SFD designation. However, it remains to be seen whether this will prove possible and, if so, what form these will assume.  Another example relates to issues arising with regard to the proposed moratorium tool under the BRRD. The recent proposal to amend the BRRD, empowers competent and resolution authorities to suspend certain payments and delivery obligations, if this would help facilitate recovery and resolution. Of course, the proposal ensures exemptions from the moratorium tool related to FMIs, including CCPs. It may be necessary to consider whether there is a need to exempt recognise third-country central securities depositories and third-country payment systems subject to a cooperative oversight arrangement involving at least one central bank in of the ESCB. The rationale is that a suspension prohibiting a participant (e.g. a credit institution) from making any payments to an FMI will de facto cause that participant to no longer be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. For payment obligations to FMIs, this would place the participant in default. Without an exemption for this type of payment, the moratorium would actually have the potential to amplify systemic risk before the FMI safeguards kick in.  Conclusion I have a few concluding remarks. First, these various legislative initiatives are crucially important in the current context. Ensuring a successful outcome of these discussions in a timely manner should be a key priority for EU legislators.  Second, we strongly welcome the intention of the legislator to give central banks of issue a role in the regulatory framework for CCPs, commensurate with their responsibilities. As I have said, this is of crucial importance, considering the fundamental impact CCPs can have on monetary policy. At the same time, the involvement of the central bank in the regulatory framework should not put into question either its independence or its discretion to define the scope of its monetary policy. We are confident that the EU legislator will fully recognise this imperative.  Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",

Ten years since the outbreak of the financial crisis and still ahead of fully concluding the subsequent regulatory reform, we are already seeing attempts to roll back financial regulation.  The reform has been successful in building a safer financial system and priority should be given to completing the agenda of Basel III. Subsequently, there will be time to assess its effects and possibly adjust it with some amendments that may improve its effectiveness. Right now, the world economy is enjoying a moment of synchronous recovery and, if anything, the concerns arise from possible excesses of financial market buoyancy, not from a lack of finance to support the recovery.  It is still premature to assess the strength of the current regulatory pushback but not soon enough to try to prevent its success. We should not allow the memory of the financial crisis we went through to be dissipated in the fog of vested interests. Euro area output is now 19% below the level it would have achieved had the trend growth in the 15 years prior to 2007 continued thereafter. Were the economy to have grown from now on at that same trend, the accumulated loss of output until 2030, properly discounted, would represent more than three times the annual output in 2008. The crisis left behind a permanent economic loss with its correspondent human costs that help explain the populist backlash that is spreading at each election in our democracies.  The crisis represented a remarkable failure of macroeconomics which has ignored that the economy is not swiftly self-correcting towards a good equilibrium. Public policies are thus needed. At the same time, the crisis showed that the financial sector can endogenously generate imbalances with significant consequences for the real economy. Furthermore, finance theory, endorsing the Efficient Market Hypothesis, contributed to the views favourable to light regulation and supervision. Several past regulatory changes reflect those views: the Glass-Steagall repeal; the 1995 Basel Accord allowing the use of banks’ internal models for the assessment of market risk; the 2004 Basel II Accord extending the use of internal models to credit risk; the 2003 U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) decision allowing mortgage Asset Based Securities (ABS) to be used in repurchase agreements (repos) and the subsequent changes in 2005 to the U.S. Bankruptcy Law, excluding repos from bankruptcy processes thus rendering them a “safe haven”. The crisis and the expansion of finance As in past cases, the recent financial crisis had its origins in excessive leverage and excessive credit or debt creation in the financial system as a whole.  These excessive imbalances were not considered a risk by the economic thinking of the time. As credit expanded and assets grew, the share of the financial sector in total GDP increased exponentially. In Europe, this led to strong growth of some important universal banks. In the euro area, total bank assets represented 116% of GDP in 1985 but increased to 219% in 2000 and to 320% in 2008. Already in 2002, the assets of the 12 biggest banks in Europe represented 64% of GDP and as Bayoumi states in his recent book, “they were already becoming too big to fail”.[1] In the U.S., the increase in finance was mostly due to the expansion of the so-called “shadow banking” sector. In 2007, total assets in the shadow banking sector equalled the level of total bank assets. Figures concerning non-banks’ involvement in credit intermediation are also remarkable: the size of euro area investment funds more than tripled from 2007 to the present, from 13% of total banking assets to the present 41%. Profits are a further indicator of the sector’s expansion: in the U.S. financial sector profits climbed from 8% of the non-financial firms’ profits at the beginning of the 1980s to a peak of 68% in 2003, hovering around 30% in the past few years.[2]  The expansion of the financial sector was not enabled by savings invested in the capital of financial institutions but mostly by a redefinition of risk capital and its endorsement by regulators. On the eve of the crisis, a few significant European banks had a leverage ratio (equity over total assets) of just 1.5% to 2% while capital ratios were well above the regulatory minimum of 8%. The “magic” of internal models to calculate risk weights in regulatory capital explains the difference, although the low leverage ratio meant that a loss of 3% of total assets would wipe out banks’ capital. The second development underlying the expansion of finance relates to the rapid growth of the shadow banking sector, especially in the U.S. To be precise, the appropriate concept of shadow banking conflates entities and activities involved in a vast array of services related to securitisation, repos and securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. These instruments contributed to the creation of a market-based credit system funded by secured short-term market funding.  The motivation for this new credit system relates to the emergence of very sizeable cash pools that could not find safety in banks’ insured deposits and were in search of safer forms of placing that cash in the short-term.[3] Those three main instruments were used to create supposedly “safer” private short-term assets. The crisis came when crashing housing prices raised doubts about securitisations and when chains of inside liquidity created by repos with re-hypothecation and re-use of the same securities,[4] collapsed with rising haircuts and resulting illiquid markets. That is why Gary Gorton characterises the 2007/2008 financial crisis as a “run on repo”.  We live now in a collaterised financial system where unsecured interbank transactions have been continuously declining.[5] It is important to understand these developments because they represent a structural change in our financial systems and go beyond the simple increased role of non-bank financial institutions in credit intermediation. The enhanced role of these institutions is nevertheless relevant as they may contribute to the increase of leverage in the whole financial system that cannot be measured by simply looking at banks’ balance sheets but has to consider synthetic leverage built with derivatives. History illustrates that there is a spontaneous tendency for finance to increase leverage and maturity transformation without considering the potential social costs of an overall excess of credit and debt and the crashes that may follow. This is particularly true for banks, where incentives are distorted by the safety net ensured by deposit guarantee schemes and by the implicit backstop normally provided by public authorities to avoid the spread of financial crises. There is therefore a difference between private and social costs and benefits that provides a justification for financial regulation.  Finance and growth The usual arguments against financial regulation rely on the notion that finance is good for growth, and more finance is always better.[6] Before the financial crisis, the near-consensus in the academic literature was that the relationship between finance and growth was causal and monotonic. The financial crisis prompted a reassessment of this view. More recent evidence has illustrated that the relationship between finance and growth is non-linear: when it grows beyond a threshold level, estimated to be a ratio of private credit to GDP of around 100%, the financial sector stops supporting, and can even start hurting, economic growth.[7] A number of theories, as well as evidence to support them, have been put forth to explain this fact. First, it has been pointed out that financial institutions first exhaust the most productive investment opportunities: too much financial intermediation thus tends to imply excessive support of unproductive investment projects.[8] Others have suggested that there is a trade-off between economic development and macroeconomic risk which is exacerbated when financial intermediation intensifies.[9] The third potential explanation for the non-monotonic relationship between finance and growth at high levels of development is the brain drain from the real sector into the financial sector, which led one economist to worry about whether we have too many financiers and too few engineers.[10] A final explanation relates to increased rent extraction from the real economy by financial firms managing investors’ money.[11]  Despite a number of regulatory initiatives to tame finance after the crisis, the financial sector at present is growing faster than GDP. In spite of this, the financial industry argues that finance has been overregulated, especially in terms of high capital requirements. The recovery of credit growth however, seems to disprove this.  It is also important to underline that the studies showing the negative effects of too much finance refer to the growth of credit to the private sector. Indeed, the evidence that most financial crises in history stemmed from excessive private debt, be it corporate or household debt, is unequivocal. A recent paper analyses financial crises in advanced economies from 1870 to 2008 and finds that “private credit booms, not public borrowing or the level of public data, tend to be the main precursors of financial instability in industrial countries”.[12] In the context of the European crisis, I showed in 2013 that the main driver of the financial and economic imbalances was the fact that credit from banks in core countries to banks in the periphery quintupled from the inception of monetary union until 2008.[13]  Even in the absence of crises, high levels of private debt are detrimental to the economy. For example, empirical research has recently argued that excessive corporate debt is one of the root causes of the slow recovery in corporate investment in Europe since the financial crisis as investment is pushed down by corporate debt overhang.[14] Moreover, recent evidence shows that high household debt is inevitably associated with a slowdown of GDP growth and an increase in unemployment rates.[15]  The outstanding corporate debt in the euro area almost doubled during the decade preceding the global financial crisis, from EUR 5.3 trillion in 1999 to EUR 9.6 trillion in 2008. Corporate debt continued to rise throughout the crisis, albeit at a slower pace, and reached just over EUR 11 trillion in 2016. We saw similar developments in household debt over these two decades, with household debt rising particularly strongly in the decade preceding the global financial crisis, almost doubling from EUR 3.2 trillion in 1999 to EUR 5.8 trillion in 2008, and rising further since then – albeit at a slower pace, to reach EUR 6.3 trillion in 2016. Importantly, during these two decades, there is no clear causal relationship between developments in either outstanding corporate debt or in outstanding household debt and productivity growth. These facts explain why macroprudential policy, born in the wake of the crisis, tries to smooth out credit booms and tame finance by acting at the level of the system as a whole. FinTech and regulation Another challenge to regulation comes from the spread of FinTech: the use of new technologies to develop and distribute financial products and services. The evident benefits of FinTech relate to the potential reduction of transaction costs and the prospect of greater financial inclusion around the world. In the view of its enthusiasts, FinTech will be radically disruptive, breaking industry boundaries and upending financial intermediation by eliminating traditional banks. There is a lot of exaggeration in this view. The footprint of new FinTech firms is still rather small. The new technologies – notably blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning and decision algorithms – are already being used by incumbent banks and asset managers who are not about to be swarmed by a host of nimble small FinTech firms.  Nevertheless, some usage can be significantly transformative. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by asset managers is one example that will create new risks and may contribute to further concentration in the sector. Another example is the change in Real Time Gross Settlement systems run by central banks. Private big banks are already developing projects based on blockchain technology to create their own networks to clear and settle all types of transactions among themselves. Some central banks have been working on similar systems collaborating with private banks. The Ubin project is continuing in Singapore whereas, last May, the Bank of Canada concluded that its own Jasper project showed that the technology was not sufficiently mature. In some countries, the use of cash, notes and coins is declining at fast rates and we cannot disregard its possible disappearance in the future. In most jurisdictions however, that possibility is very far away, if it ever occurs. In the euro area, issuance of bank notes has more than tripled since 2001 and is still growing at about 5% a year. All the developments I mentioned would not materially change the nature of our financial system, the concept of money or the effectiveness of central banks’ monetary policy. The so-called private “crypto-currencies” can never prevail as general money substitutes. Their designation is a misnomer as they are not a currency but just a commodity used as a speculative asset and as a restricted medium of exchange in very special circumstances, comprising criminal activities or failed States with collapsed institutions. Instead, the use of the blockchain by central banks to create digital currency open to all citizens without limits would be really disruptive. This would be a radical political choice that could end banking as we know it and is therefore unlikely to happen.  Ignoring that possibility and regarding current banking activity, FinTech has penetrated mostly into payment systems. Banks’ payment-related income has decreased but some is retained as bank accounts are still the ultimate way of settling. Where FinTech can have a big impact is in cross-border payments by using the blockchain technology to eliminate several intermediate steps, speed up global transfers and promote worldwide financial inclusion.  Concerning credit, peer-to-peer (P2P) or crowdfunding, FinTech lending is still very small in general, with the exception of the U.S. where mortgage origination is significant, even if the online firms do not keep the exposures in their small balance sheets.[16]  This progress is naturally due to the fact that FinTech firms are much less regulated than traditional institutions under the presumption that it is good to allow new competition. The hope of FinTech enthusiasts is that its spread will lead to much lighter financial regulation.  However, new technologies generate new risks and do not eliminate the old ones which provide the rationale for financial regulation in the first place. Asymmetries of information and default externalities do not disappear with the introduction of new ways of supplying financial services. FinTech does not provide an excuse for less regulation. It is the specific nature of finance in our economies that provides the rationale for financial regulation which is different from the one applied to other sectors, particularly those related to privatised former public utilities. In this case, it is insufficient competition that justifies the regulatory bias in favour of new firms entering the sector. This principle is not a major driver of regulation in the financial sector where competition is in general sufficient, prices do not need to be regulated and no special protection is warranted for new entrants, especially when they offer only part of the services assured by the incumbents. Another principle is that we need a financial system with bank-like institutions to provide deposit liquidity services and maturity transformation. Narrow banking or similar approaches do not guarantee the amount of credit to finance investment and economic growth.[17] The solution proposed by FinTech enthusiasts of substituting banks by a sort of money market funds or even by investment funds, offering securities’ accounts with provision of liquidity services, confronts the difficulty that in stressful situations there is no guarantee that funds’ units can be redeemed at par. For good reasons, mutual or investment funds cannot legally offer cheque accounts.  Historically, bank regulation was created to ensure depositors’ protection and to prevent bank runs. The imposition of capital ratios and the creation of deposit guarantee schemes emerged at the beginning of the last century as the minimum regulatory solutions to attain those objectives. Similar concerns subsequently led to the supervision of individual banks’ asset quality and liquidity position, completing the micro-supervisory instruments to ensure the robustness of individual institutions. The deposit contract is indeed the specific service that distinguishes a bank from other financial institutions. Several other financial entities can provide credit. However, only when the credit is funded by regularly collected funds from the public and redemption at the same nominal value is guaranteed, is a financial institution considered a bank, subject to the respective regulation. Regulators should not lose sight of these basic concepts when allowing FinTech firms to get out of their facile regulatory “sandboxes”.  Overview of the regulatory reform and its limitations  As mentioned at the start, ahead of the conclusion of the post-crisis regulatory reform, there are already attempts to roll back financial regulation. The main points under pressure are the Leverage Ratio (LR), the limitation of the use of internal models to assess credit risk and corresponding capital requirements, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book. Regarding capital requirements, the mandatory LR applied to banks was one of the most important reforms introduced. Basel III fixed the LR at 3% of Tier 1 capital which still corresponds to total assets about 33 times Tier 1 (against 50 times equity for some EU banks pre-crisis). There are pressures to exclude repos, sovereign bonds and export credits from the LR. This weakening of the standard should be avoided as it increases the probability of crises and output losses.[18] In his recent book, William Cline (2017)[19] estimates optimal LR at 7% to 8% for significant U.S. banks, corresponding to 12% to 14% of risk-weighted capital ratio (RWCR). Morris Goldstein (2017)[20] shows that the LR is more accurate in predicting bank failures than RWCRs since the latter have been affected by misuse of internal models by large banks. In fact, for U.S. banks, Goldstein shows that the ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets came down from 70% in 1993 to 40% in 2011 with no apparent link to the credit portfolio composition.  The binding risk-weighted common equity capital ratio was fixed by Basel III at 7%. Euro area significant banks now have, on average, common equity tier 1 ratio of 14%. A number of studies to calibrate an optimal capital ratio against a reasonably low crises probability have been carried out. In preparation for Basel\\xa0III[21], studies identified that banking crises occur every 20 to 25 years, corresponding to a 4.6% probability per annum. It is shown that a four percentage point increase in the capital ratio lowers this annual probability to less than 1%, while a one percentage point reduction in the annual probability of banking crises results in an expected drop in output of 0.6%. The study did not try to estimate an optimal level of capital but a 2015 Bank of England paper maps this analysis into a desirable range of 16 to19%,[22] while an earlier paper puts this range at 15 to 20%.[23] Recently, Jordá, Richter, Schularik and Taylor (2017)[24] illustrate that RWCR are not good predictors of bank crises and recall that in the 1920s, the capital ratios above 20% did not prevent the host of bank failures in the Great Depression. The analysis shows that higher capital reduces the severity of the crises as better capitalised banks tend to provide more credit.[25]  Some authors argue that the introduction of the concepts of Total Loss-Absorbable Capacity (TLAC) and Minimum Requirements for Eligible Liabilities (MREL) for the purpose of bank resolution could implicate a lower capital ratio to start with.[26] However, a more recent FED paper, considering the potential effect of TLAC still reaches an optimal range of capital ratio between 13 and 25%.[27]  Considering these studies, there is no justification to weaken the LR standard, nor is there rationale for not restricting the use of internal models for credit risk, to be finalised before the year-end. Without an agreement to finalise Basel\\xa0III, we run the risk of contributing to the fragmentation of international regulation and helping those who want to destroy the multilateral approach that has served us well.  But beyond solvency and high capital ratios, the crisis has illustrated liquidity risk, thus the importance of liquidity management rules introduced for the first time in Basel\\xa0III standards. Particularly in Europe, banks relied too much on wholesale funding reaching an average credit-to-deposit ratio of 145% in 2007, a level that stands now at 120%. In this perspective, a mandatory NSFR is quite relevant and should not be weakened or delayed.  Maturity transformation by banks is very much driven by housing financing and long-term mortgages. This has generated proposals to change the terms of housing financing to further reduce the risks of funding mortgage credit with short-term deposit liabilities. Many ideas have been put forward to change this[28] including tilting even more the NSFR to correct that bias; encouraging more securitisation with low maturity transformation; creating a new type of financial institutions specialised in mortgages or, introducing a new type of mortgage contract that would have more equity participation by lenders in exchange of sharing the returns of appreciating housing prices, proposed by Mian and Sufi in “House of debt”.[29]   Housing credit has been growing in importance for banks in many jurisdictions over the past decades. In 17 developed countries, the weight of real estate bank lending in total credit increased 40% from 1970 to 2007.[30] New regulations restricting the role of banks in mortgage lending would therefore be a significant structural change in our financial systems.  In addition to new capital and liquidity requirements, the regulatory reform had some success in addressing the question of too-big-to-fail (TBTF) institutions. The international agreement in the Financial Stability Board (FSB) about a set of key attributes for bank resolution and the introduction of TLAC, created conditions for more credible resolution regimes. The Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in the EU marked a shift away from the previously prevailing bailout approach to a bail-in regime. In what regards cross-border resolutions, the new framework still has some issues to clarify, especially if the U.S. abolishes the Orderly Liquidation Authority and the respective Fund. In general, the new regime can be entrusted to deal with one or a few failing institutions. This is important to ensure market discipline and avoid moral hazard. However, the remaining concern is that the framework may not be appropriate to deal with general financial crises like the one we just had, when the problem is the existence of too-many-to-fail banks. Examining the history of crises, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that such situations require public intervention to backstop liabilities and recapitalise the system. Exceptional interventions that were carried out in the crisis are however no longer legally possible in several jurisdictions.[31] Also, there is no crisis management framework ready should another episode of generalised banking crisis emerge. In fact, public interventions may reduce overall income losses for the population stemming from economic distress. The Troubled Asset Relief Program in the U.S. that was totally repaid by the banks or the public intervention in the Nordic banking crisis of the 1990s, that penalised shareholders and reduced the costs for the State, are examples of how to avoid both losses for the public and moral hazard.  Turning now to non-banks, the role of the shadow banking sector in the crisis greatly related to the use of securitisation, repos and OTC derivatives. The crisis revealed the important contribution of these dynamics in derivatives and SFT to systemic stress.[32] For SFTs, particularly repos, a key concern relates to excessive reliance on short-term wholesale funding via these transactions. Indeed, SFTs were identified as a major source of leverage in the financial system and as an important determinant of banks’ vulnerability to funding and liquidity shocks.[33]  The creation of inside liquidity by repos was important for the funding of the housing bubble[34]. The 2003 decision by the SEC to allow mortgage ABS to be used for repos and the 2005 legal amendment excluding repos from bankruptcy processes led to the increase of the repo market. Similar changes took place at the same time in Europe.[35] As stated in Perotti (2010) “These privileges were granted to overnight secured credit and derivatives, and essentially allowed these lenders to ‘front run’ all other investors in case of default. This made such lending safer for the lenders, and thus cheap for the borrowers. The result was fantastic growth of unstable funding to the detriment of stability”. We know what happened in the crisis, once again proving the statement by Douglas Diamond: “Financial crises are everywhere and always about short-term debt”.[36]  The crisis itself made securitisations and repos shrink significantly. In the U.S., broker-dealers changed into banks, making the shadow banking sector smaller. Post-reform, securitisations became less attractive being now subject to higher capital charges, securities vehicles were consolidated with bank sponsors and repos and OTC derivatives have become subject to central clearing. The overall progress in reducing risk in STFs and derivative markets has been significant, but might not be sufficient. Very little has been done to prevent the expansion and misuse of those instruments in any future euphoric episode. The recent recommendations by the FSB are in my view not sufficiently far-reaching regarding the re-hypothecation and re-use of securities in repos.[37] Regarding the use of margins and haircuts, the FSB recommendations to introduce minimum initial levels are also quite narrow: they exclude sovereign paper and transactions between regulated institutions and apply only to non-centrally cleared operations. Going forward, more may have to be done.  In regulatory circles, the potential for setting margins and haircuts as a policy tool to address systemic risks in derivatives and SFT markets was already identified shortly after the global financial crisis. Indeed, the BIS Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) concluded, already in 2009, that margining practices in OTC derivatives and haircut-setting in SFTs are a source of procyclicality in the financial system, and recommended enhancements to these practices in order to dampen the build-up of leverage in good times and soften the system-wide effects in bad times.[38]\\xa0Furthermore, the CGFS encouraged macroprudential authorities to consider measures that involve countercyclical variations in margins and haircuts. In the ECB’s response to the European Commission’s consultation on the review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), we\\xa0suggested “that macroprudential intervention tools be included in Level 1 of EMIR”\\xa0and noted\\xa0“two policy instruments that potentially could reduce or limit leverage through derivatives and SFTs and the pro-cyclicality of margins and haircuts: (a) permanent minimum requirements, and (b) time-varying minimum requirements or buffers”.[39]  Setting minimum margins and haircut floors would limit the build-up of leverage and reduce the procyclicality of current margin and haircut setting practices.[40]  On the other hand, I welcome the release of policy recommendations by the FSB to address structural vulnerabilities arising from asset management activities. They cover liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms, operational risk, securities lending activities and leverage reporting by investment funds, including synthetic leverage built up usually with OTC derivatives. Leverage requirements for investment funds, already partially introduced in Europe, represent an important point. The final aim should be to extend LR requirements to a broader set of financial institutions and to account for the risks posed by synthetic leverage from the use of derivatives as recently proposed by Dirk Schoenmaker.[41]  The last point I want to address concerns macroprudential policy. It is well known that this new policy emerged as one of the lessons of the crisis, namely the realisation that while individual institutions could be seen as robust, the system as a whole could be generating imbalances and vulnerabilities. Externalities stemming from excessive leverage, liquidity mismatch and network interconnectedness were indeed building up before the onset of the crisis. Since then, debate about regulatory reform adopted this overall angle of analysis which then shaped the instrument calibrations. Two objectives are normally assigned to macroprudential policy: to increase the resilience of the system and to smooth the amplitude of the financial cycle.[42] I want to underline the second goal as a complement to monetary policy to manage the financial and the business cycle, respectively.  By using instruments like the counter-cyclical capital buffer and borrower-based debt-to-income and loan-to-value tools in housing credit, macroprudential policy can use a targeted way of containing credit expansion, especially if associated with real estate. In turn, monetary policy, precisely because “it gets in all of the cracks”[43], is too blind an instrument to try to contain particular credit booms. If used to address systemic risks, it may unnecessarily lead to recessions that inflation conditions would not justify. This is even more the case in a monetary union where vulnerabilities identified in each country can be addressed with macroprudential policy, allowing for the appropriate heterogeneity, while countries remain subject to a single monetary policy. Another aspect of the problem is that when asset returns are going up sharply, for instance in housing, the increase in interest rates would have to be quite sizeable to have any effect in curbing an asset price boom. In general, a monetary policy of “leaning against the wind” for financial stability reasons could induce significant output losses.[44] Macroprudential policy and monetary policy rely on separate tools and aim to achieve different objectives. Yet, they need to be co-ordinated, which is a non-trivial task given that financial and business cycles can be de-synchronised. It is my contention that without an effective macroprudential policy, advanced economies will not be able to safeguard financial stability. It is therefore an important endeavour to keep fighting for the appropriate tools and policies to smooth the financial cycle and to sufficiently tame finance in order to avoid crises that may threaten the future of our economies.

Having emerged from a major crisis, it faces challenges and change. But one thing has not changed, and it never will. A bank needs a sustainable business model. It has to earn revenues; it has to keep its costs in check; and it has to keep its risks under control. How all this is done has changed, however. Many things that still worked a couple of years ago no longer work today. Let me quickly highlight a few points. Profitability is low for many banks. First, for a long time, economic growth was low. Together with low interest rates, that has put a brake on a traditional source of revenue. Banks, in particular those that have not found a profitable market niche, need to diversify their sources of revenue. Digitalisation might offer a solution, but it is certainly not the only one. Second, some national banking markets in Europe are overbanked and therefore overly competitive. So there is a need for consolidation – consolidation which leads to stronger banks with viable business models. Third, many banks still have high costs, partly because of their large branch networks. But how large do these networks actually need to be in this age of digital banking? Fourth, some banks are still weighed down by impaired balance sheets. They need to get rid of legacy assets such as non-performing loans. Fifth, some banks could improve the way they handle risks. They need to establish a strong risk culture, set up adequate risk governance and integrate it into their overall structure. And finally, all banks have to adapt to more stringent rules. It is true that they come at a cost, but in the long run, their benefits are greater. Society benefits in any case, but so do the banks. Strong rules help to win people’s trust, and that is an important asset for banks. A few banks still have some way to go – they still need to adapt their business models; they need to find their competitive advantage. Those banks which want to prosper in the future need to act now. And it is indeed possible to prosper, even in tough times. Across the euro area, we see about two dozen large banks which constantly outperform their peers. They are based in different countries, they are of different sizes, and they have different business models.  So it is not about a single successful business model. It is about the whole set-up of how to do banking today. And, as these banks show, it is possible to succeed – that is encouraging, for us and for the banks. These are challenging times for banks; there is no doubt about that. One thing is clear, though: tomorrow’s business models will look different from today’s. But hasn’t that always been true? Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",
      "['2017-11-07', 'Mario Draghi', 'European banking supervision three years on', 'Welcome remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the second ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt am Main, 7 November 2017', '  European banking supervision three years on   Welcome remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the second ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt am Main, 7 November 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you to this second ECB Forum on Banking Supervision.  When I spoke at the Forum in 2015, European banking supervision had only been in operation for one year. Much had been achieved in that time – not least the comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets – but in many ways the single supervisor was still untested.  We saw European banking supervision as having two main objectives: to reduce bank-specific risks through tough and forward-looking supervision; and to reduce country-specific risks in the banking sector by applying those same high standards across the whole of the euro area. Now, three years on, we can begin to take stock of what has been accomplished.  What is clear is that European supervision has been instrumental in building a stronger and more resilient banking sector. The country in which a bank is located has also become a less important factor in how its credit risk is perceived.  These two achievements have been a crucial complement for our monetary policy, too, since banks are the main channel of financial intermediation in the euro area. A well-integrated financial sector with sound banks has helped transmit our policy impulses more evenly across the euro area. And it has allowed us to pursue an accommodative policy for as long as necessary, without building up significant financial stability risks.  Progress with European banking supervision There is no doubt that building European supervision has been a remarkable undertaking. Today we have 900 supervisory staff working at the ECB who, together with 4,700 national supervisors, directly oversee around €22 trillion in assets, representing around 200% of euro area GDP.  But more important than its scale have been the changes the single supervisor has prompted in the conduct of supervision. It has broken with the past in a single, but fundamental way.  That is: it has brought about a more uniform approach in how banks are supervised, leading to a more resilient banking sector overall. The key catalyst for this change – alongside the new EU regulations – has been the harmonisation of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).  This harmonisation has allowed supervisors to converge towards common benchmarks in how they assess risks; and it has helped them to be consistent in how their risk assessments are then linked to supervisory capital add-ons and other measures. To illustrate the difference this has made, in 2014 the correlation between SREP scores and Pillar 2 capital requirements was 26% in the euro area. In 2016, it was 76%.  European supervision has therefore resulted in a substantial strengthening of shock-absorbing capacity within the sector. The total capital ratio of banks supervised by the ECB has increased by more than 170 basis points since early 2015. The quality of capital has gone up as well: the high-loss absorbing component – CET1 – now makes up the largest share of total capital of euro area banks.  Specific weaknesses are also now being addressed in their entirety across the euro area. Currently the most important issue here is tackling non-performing loans (NPLs). We all know the damage that persistently high levels of NPLs can do to banks’ health and credit growth. Internal ECB analysis shows that, over recent years, banks with high stocks of NPLs have consistently lent less than banks with better credit quality, therefore providing less support to firms and households.  And though NPL levels have been coming down for significant institutions – from around 7.5% in early 2015 to 5.5% now – the problem is not yet solved. Many banks still lack the ability to absorb large losses, as their ratio of bad loans to capital and provisions remains high.  We therefore need a joint effort by banks, supervisors, regulators and national authorities to address this issue in an orderly manner, first and foremost by creating an environment where NPLs can be effectively managed and efficiently disposed of.  Importantly, the development of European supervision has not only reduced the risk of individual banks failing. It has also – as we hoped – had some success in reducing the importance of location in perceptions of bank risk, because single, rigorous supervision is an essential precondition for the other pillars of the banking union that more decisively sever the bank-sovereign nexus. Indeed, looking at the largest banks for which we have data available, the correlation between bank credit default swaps and those of sovereigns is now considerably weaker than at the height of the euro area crisis. Still, there is no room for complacency, since these improvements are likely to have been driven, in part, by the improved economic situation. It is therefore crucial that further reforms to de-link banks from sovereigns do not lose steam, notably completing the other pillars of banking union. The benefits of strong supervision for monetary policy All these supervisory efforts have not only produced a more robust banking sector; they have also provided crucial support for our monetary policy since we entered a new easing phase in mid-2014. This support has come from two main sources. First, stronger supervision has improved the transmission of our policy impulses through banks.  There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that the level of bank capital is a key variable in how banks lend during downturns, and hence also for monetary policy transmission.[1] It is therefore no surprise that the improved health of the banking sector, coupled with our credit easing measures, has coincided with a marked improvement in the transmission process.  Previous asymmetries in bank lending rates across the euro area have now largely been reversed, the cost of bank borrowing has stabilised at record lows everywhere in the euro area, and so has its dispersion across countries. We can now say that the pass-through from our past policy measures to lending rates is nearing completion.  The decline in lending rates has been particularly noticeable for small loans in vulnerable countries, which are a proxy for the financing conditions faced by SMEs. SMEs are of course highly dependent on well-functioning banks as their options are limited when it comes to accessing market finance. For these small loans, the spread between vulnerable and more resilient countries has now narrowed to a record low of 5 basis points. This more even credit pricing across countries and firms has, in turn, been crucial to the broadening of the economic and employment recovery, not least because SMEs represent 60% of euro area value added and employ 70% of the labour force.  The second way in which stronger supervision has supported our monetary policy is by helping contain any financial stability risks that may emerge during a long period of low rates.  One channel through which such risks can appear is search-for-yield effects: low rates can, in principle, induce banks into making lower-quality loans, leading to higher loan losses. But with a strong supervisor ensuring well-capitalised banks, the quality of lending tends to be higher. This is confirmed by a major study looking at loan-level data in Spain, which finds that, when overnight rates fall, highly capitalised banks grant fewer loan applications to risky firms than lowly capitalised banks, and have fewer loan defaults.[2]  With a more resilient banking sector in the euro area, we have seen this more positive picture develop. Credit risk exposures in banks’ loan books have declined as monetary policy has eased. Default rates have fallen, and forward-looking measures also suggest a decline in credit risk. This has of course been driven by improvements in credit quality as the macroeconomic situation has improved. But it may also reflect the role of higher capital in resolving agency problems: the more a bank is capitalised, the more its owners stand to lose if borrowers default and cause losses. So the more equity a bank holds, the greater its incentive to make higher-quality loans.  Other financial stability issues associated with low rates have also not materialised, thanks in part to the stronger supervisory framework. At euro area level, we currently see no signs of credit-fuelled housing bubbles, which are at the root of most serious financial crises. Since 2016, bank lending for house purchases has risen, on average, by 2.9% per year – well below the growth rates of up to 12% recorded in the run-up to the crisis. Some local pockets of risk have emerged, but both supervisors and macroprudential authorities are actively taking steps to counter them. We have also seen little evidence that negative interest rates are undermining bank profitability, an issue which has caused a lot of concern. This would pose a financial stability risk to the extent that it hinders banks from building up capital through retained earnings and makes raising market equity too expensive. It would also affect monetary transmission for the same reasons.  In fact, net interest income has remained quite stable over the past two years, even as overnight rates have drifted lower. And thanks to gains in other income components, banks’ return on equity has been rising and is converging towards their cost of equity. For the banks under ECB supervision, return on equity has risen from 4.4% at the end of 2015 to 7.1% at the start of this year. This neutral impact of negative rates is largely due to the general equilibrium effects of monetary policy that we have explained many times: when policy is accommodative, the main components of profitability largely offset each other, since the positive impact of a stronger economy on loan-loss provisions largely cancels out any negative effect on net interest income.[3]  For some banks, however, these negative effects may be larger than for others. This is where strong supervision is again crucial. As part of its SREP, ECB Banking Supervision carries out detailed, comparative assessments of banks’ business models, which feed into the ongoing supervisory dialogue between the supervisory teams and banks.  This process is not prescriptive, but it helps bring to light important issues such as the sustainability of banks’ business models in a low rate environment, and their operating costs in comparison with their peers, which in some countries are a contributing factor to low profitability. Conclusion Let me conclude.  We are now three years into the life of European banking supervision, and the track record so far is encouraging. Though the single supervisor is still a young and developing institution, it has in many ways lived up to the high expectations that accompanied its founding.  Rigorous and uniform supervision has led to higher levels of capital and a more resilient sector overall. The credit risk of banks is now less determined by the credit risk of their country of establishment.  Healthier banks have, in turn, helped transmit the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy more evenly across the euro area, leading to a stronger and broader recovery. And the new supervisory framework has helped mitigate any financial stability risks that might have arisen as a result.  In short, European supervision and European monetary policy have proven to complement each other well. It is an approach which confirms the synergies that can be reaped when the right policies are combined at euro area level.       [1] See, for example: Buch, C. M. and Prieto, E.

      "['2017-11-06', 'Yves Mersch', 'Europe in transformation: Structural, regulatory and technological challenges for the markets of tomorrow', 'Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Slovenian Banking Days conference, Brdo pri Kranju, Slovenia, 6 November 2017', '  Europe in transformation: Structural, regulatory and technological challenges for the markets of tomorrow   Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Slovenian Banking Days conference, Brdo pri Kranju, Slovenia, 6 November 2017 Banks play a vital role in the economy, matching surplus funds from savers to those wishing to invest in profitable projects – a process that contributes to the growth in productivity and overall welfare. It is also a process that plays an important role in the transmission of monetary policy, which means that monetary policymakers, such as myself, take great interest in the structure and performance of the banking sector. From this point of view too, it is important that the sector operates in an efficient and smooth fashion. During the crisis, banks in the euro area did not operate in this way, and their failure to do so exacerbated the impact of the crisis on people and on the economy. This will be the focus of my talk today. Banks face a number of challenges, visible in the weak financial performance of the sector, with low price-to-book ratios and meagre profitability. Compared with the pre-crisis status quo, profound changes in the sector in terms of structure and business models will be needed to tackle those challenges. Broadly speaking, the challenges are threefold: structural, regulatory and technological. Structural challenges We are now a decade after the onset of the crisis. Yet despite the ongoing broad-based recovery in the euro area economy, bank profitability remains low. In part, the roots of that continued poor performance lie before the crisis, which served to expose structural issues within the European banking sector. Chronic overcapacity had resulted in poor profitability and too much lending to marginal projects which eventually turned sour.  That stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains high in some countries and continues to depress bank profitability today. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around €1 trillion. This NPL overhang is tying up bank capital in failed or failing ventures and preventing the efficient flow of new lending to profitable projects. How should banks react to this challenge? First, we should recognise that Europe remains overbanked. Although progress has been made on this front, with 25% fewer credit institutions in the euro area now than in 2008,[1] there is considerable scope for consolidation within some countries and across borders. The creation of Europe-wide banking groups would help break the bank-sovereign nexus and the consequent fragmentation of bank lending along national lines and through national interference that so marked the crisis. Credit provision should then be able to continue in a smooth fashion in future downturns, mitigating, rather than exacerbating, asymmetric shocks.  Greater efforts should be made to resolve the overhang of NPLs. I see a number of avenues that are worth exploring. Banks themselves should make efforts to fully provision the true expected loss from NPLs. Countries where NPLs are higher are often those where weak institutions make it difficult for banks to seek insolvencies and seize collateral from non-payers. Structural reforms to boost judicial efficiency will aid banks in the process of NPL recovery. Finally, setting up an effective Europe-wide securitisation market for distressed debt should help banks to shift NPLs from their balance sheets and free up capital for new lending. Too much remains on bank balance sheets at uncertain values by comparison with other continents, where securitisation makes assets tradable, thereby allowing the markets to clear banks’ balance sheets.  Zombie banks supported by official interventions prevent new lending to the economy. And the low growth environment fostered by such behaviour in turn sours more assets on the banks’ balance sheets.  To break this vicious circle, determined action on NPLs is required. Regulatory challenges The second challenge faced by banks is the stricter regulatory and prudential framework imposed on the sector following the crisis. These measures aim to create a banking sector that works efficiently and smoothly, as I mentioned earlier.  Banks are now required to have more – and better quality – capital. The incoming rules on liquidity and leverage are already forcing banks to make some tough decisions on asset allocation and business lines. New regulations on resolution provide supervisors and the resolution authority with a toolkit to intervene early to require banks in difficulty to take necessary actions to bring about recovery.  In the case of an actual resolution, the new regulations aim to minimise the impact of a failed bank on overall financial stability – i.e. to ensure the system as a whole runs smoothly and to better protect taxpayers’ money at large, rather than the invested money of the few directly involved.  There is evidence that these new regulations are helping to create a stronger banking sector in the euro area. Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios of significant institutions rose on average from 7% in 2007 to 13.5% by end-2016. I recognise that tighter regulations do come at a higher cost to banks, but this should be set against the costs incurred by society over the past decade as a result of regulation that was too lax. Nonetheless, regulators should quickly agree on appropriate international standards to give banks certainty over long-term planning around business models. Technological challenges The final challenge for banks comes from the impact of technology, which is leading to increased competition from non-banks in domains traditionally considered to be the core business of banks: lending and payment services. I wish to focus my remarks on this particular challenge today.  With regard to lending, technological advances have permitted the growth of internet and mobile banking, opening up the sector to newcomers and exposing incumbents with large branch networks to greater competition. Moreover, there is a shift to more market-based finance in the euro area, a trend that is likely to continue under the Capital Markets Union initiative. While still small in overall terms, there is a growing role for so-called shadow banking – asset managers, pension funds, money market funds and the like – in providing financing to the real economy. But there is also increased competition in the provision of retail payment services, made possible through new technology, which is disrupting banks’ traditional business models.  Traditionally, banks have offered payment services as an extension of a customer account – debit and credit cards, direct debits and the like. There has of course always been some limited competition between banks – customers could obtain a credit card from another bank, and even change banks, although they seldom did. Yet the growth of e-commerce has created a demand for payment services outside the traditional channels. The banking sector overall was slow to respond to consumer demand, permitting companies such as PayPal to enter the market. Initially, they used the existing infrastructure and instruments, such as credit cards.  More recently, a new type of provider which directly uses the online banking services of the respective bank has emerged. Such services operated in the past in a legal and regulatory grey area, and often in contravention of the terms of service of banks’ online platforms.  Regulation has started to catch up with the new technology. The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) has codified these services, requiring companies to be authorised as a payment service providers, to identify themselves to the bank and to communicate with the bank using a common and secure method. The Directive mandated the European Banking Authority to develop technical legal requirements, which are now being finalised. The main aim of the legislation is to provide a Europe-wide common framework for payments, and a standardised interface for such payments. Without that standardisation, there was a risk that new providers would face different sets of connection protocols and data requirements from each of the 4,000 retail payment banks. By providing a standardised system that operates across the EU, PSD2 offers the basis for a new generation of financial services. For example, it will become easier for consumers to track all their accounts at different institutions using a single app and to analyse expenditure by type, and it will further open up mobile and internet payments. The benefits of this digitally integrated market for consumers should be welcomed. The Eurosystem has been involved throughout this process in several roles: as an operator to provide the right services for settlement and payments; as a catalyst to facilitate standardisation, reachability and interoperability, and as overseer and regulator to ensure a smooth functioning of payment systems and to ensure a level playing field.  Our aim, as with the provision of banking services generally, is to have a payment system that functions smoothly and efficiently, while still providing the necessary legal safeguards for data and privacy. We are striving for a regulatory framework that is consistent and neutral – neither stifling new competitors, nor protecting the incumbents.  Much work remains to be done by both banks and the providers of these payment services to ensure we have a robust framework. Despite the disruptive nature of this technology, banks have plenty of opportunities to take a leading role. Consumers clearly value the service provided by the new entrants. Rather than seeking to obstruct the new payment systems (an ultimately fruitless endeavour), banks should seize the chance to provide an extra service that their customers value. For all that technology has changed the methods of delivery, one of the constants in securing long-term viability for a service provider is keeping its customers happy.  Technology and central banking Of course, commercial banks are not the only ones facing challenges from technology and consequent changes in the economic environment. Technology also affects how central banks carry out their operations. As I said in a recent speech,[2] technological progress can affect the dynamics and measurement of inflation, which can in turn influence the monetary policy settings that are needed to fulfil our price stability mandate. The unconventional monetary policy measures we have put in place over the past decade reflected the particular circumstances at the time, when our traditional tool of influencing short-term interest rates was insufficient by itself to achieve price stability. In other areas, too, central banks are analysing the potential impact of technology. The advent of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has the potential to change how central banks issue base money[3] and operate payment systems. We are currently carrying out research to improve our understanding of this technology. It remains to be seen whether DLT can genuinely provide more efficient central banking services, while still operating smoothly and offering the necessary legal safeguards. Only through detailed research and testing can we determine if, and how, we should use DLT. This is different from the steady upgrading of our platforms to meet the demand for real-time services, as in the case of instant payments for instant purchases. But despite the changes in the institutional and economic environment, one of the constants in the field of central banking is that of central bank independence What is of essence in this concept is the freedom from the political instruction of the government or its influence. But while the institutional and economic environment is in flux, one concept in the field of central banking is an enduring one: independence. The idea is to shield monetary policy from political interference and electoral considerations. Therefore, it is clear that any reforms implemented via national legislation that specifically target the central bank, as we have seen in some recent legislative initiatives in Slovenia, must not undermine its independence either directly or indirectly by exposing the institution to political pressure.  The most recent ECB opinion approved by the Governing Council concerning the Slovenian Act on judicial relief together with the draft law amending the Banka Slovenije Act (relating to the audit of its operations) underlines the risk of inducing this undesired effect. First, the combination of the two acts creates uncertainty with regard to the standard against which Banka Slovenije’s past practices are to be audited by the Court of Audit. Let me just point out that the Slovenian Act on judicial relief was triggered by the need to remedy the unconstitutionality of certain provisions of the Slovenian Banking Act which authorised Banka Slovenije to adopt measures to write-down or convert qualified liabilities during the reorganisation of banks. Second, the Slovenian Act on judicial relief alone puts the central bank in a precarious position. Banka Slovenije is essentially obliged to file a claim against the State even though the central bank has nothing to claim but rather has to defend itself, and what is more, to defend the diligence it has exercised against an implicit presumption of wrongdoing and an ambiguous standard of assessment.  Conclusion Let me conclude. A well-functioning financial system is of vital importance for long-term, sustainable economic growth. The crisis laid bare elements of the financial system that were not functioning in the smooth and efficient manner required. The new regulatory regime put in place since the crisis provides the right framework for the banking system to function better in the future. But work remains to clear up the legacy of the crisis, particularly in terms of the overhang of NPLs. Regulation alone is insufficient, and further effort is required of banks, in terms of both consolidation and refining business models, to return the sector to sustainable rates of profitability. But efforts are also required at national level to make national institutions function in line with European legislation. Payment services is a further area where regulatory advances are of themselves insufficient to provide a working system that operates in a smooth and efficient way, that is still safe and respects European privacy provisions. Banks now have a great opportunity to embrace the new technology and serve their customers in a new fashion. Agreeing and implementing technical standards in a timely fashion will help foster the right conditions for a payment system that benefits everyone.

I would like to make some remarks on the role that money markets, monetary policy implementation and central bank balance sheets have played in our recent monetary policy decisions. The October monetary policy decision At its October meeting, the Governing Council decided to extend its net asset purchases within the asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €30bn for nine months until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary. The Governing Council re-iterated that it expects the key ECB policy rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. This decision was taken against the backdrop of the solid and broad-based economic expansion which the euro area continues to experience. Our monetary policy measures have been effective and are reflected in recent economic developments. Deflationary risks have disappeared. Some measures of underlying inflation have ticked up over recent months, but have yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Overall, inflation developments, despite the solid growth, have remained subdued. Importantly, the convergence of inflation towards our aim remains conditional on a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation. A “sustained adjustment in the path of inflation” is the principal condition that has guided, and will be guiding, the calibration of our asset purchase programme (APP). An extension of the programme was warranted by the continued need for a substantial amount of monetary policy accommodation to ensure the desired inflation convergence. When considering the appropriate calibration of the APP there were three important dimensions to consider: pace, horizon and optionality.  As regards the first dimension, pace, the brighter economic prospects have increased our confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards our aim. This called for a lower pace of purchases. Second dimension, horizon: We have always emphasised that monetary policy needs to be persistent and patient for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up. This speaks in favour of a sufficiently long horizon of additional net purchases. The longer horizon also anchors short-term interest rate expectations for a longer period, thereby reinforcing the Governing Council’s forward guidance on policy rates. The third dimension is optionality: Retaining the option to re-calibrate the APP if warranted is consistent with the forward guidance on the APP.  Key channels of the APP There are two key channels through which the APP operates. The first is the extraction of duration risk, which propagates through portfolio rebalancing. The second key channel is the signalling channel on interest rates. The duration risk channel and the signalling channel correspond to the two components of the long-term interest rates through which a central bank can seek to influence the level and shape of the yield curve: the expectations component and the term premium. How does the APP influence the term premium? By accumulating a portfolio of long-duration assets, the central bank extracts duration risk from private hands, frees up risk bearing capacity in the markets, spurs a rebalancing of private portfolios towards the remaining securities, and thereby lowers term premia and yields across a range of financial assets. Duration extraction is thus the catalyst for the portfolio rebalancing channel, which is the main mechanism by which easing through quantitative interventions is then transmitted further through the economy. Now, what matters in particular for term premia is the entire stock of duration which the central bank removes from the hands of price-sensitive investors by taking this stock of duration on its balance sheet. As a result, the continued monetary support from assets purchases is not only provided by the additional net asset purchases, but also by the sizeable stock of already acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments.  The second key channel is the signalling channel: the expectations component of long-term yields reflects market expectations of the future path of the policy-controlled short-term interest rates. In this respect the sequencing embodied in our forward guidance gives significant strength to the signalling channel.  The sequencing firmly anchors expectations for short term interest rates. The Governing Council expects the key policy rates “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”. The role and function of money markets For the signalling channel to operate it is essential that the monetary impulses are transmitted through money market rates. In this regard let me make a number of observations. Fragmentation First, for monetary policy impulses to be transmitted through money market rates, it is important that money markets are not fragmented. Last time I addressed this workshop, which was in 2013, the backdrop provided by market conditions was quite different from what it is now. At that time, we observed elevated fragmentation in money markets. This related in part to sovereign risks which were prevalent at that time. Since the sovereign debt crisis, the overall levels of fragmentation have receded sharply. The dispersion of risk-adjusted borrowing rates across countries is now relatively low.  Of course, rate-based indicators do not give direct evidence of the degree to which trading is taking place across borders. But an assessment of fragmentation based on trading quantities would be anyway rather elusive. The high level of aggregate excess liquidity has significantly curtailed the need for trading liquidity.  The fact that money market rates, adjusted for credit risks, have largely converged speaks in favour of a much reduced level of fragmentation and a more homogenous degree of access to liquidity across the euro area. This is also supported by the fact that the interest rates observed across countries are more correlated with aggregate excess liquidity levels rather than country-specific levels. Unsecured vs. secured segments Second, we have observed a sustained shift of money market activity from the unsecured to the secured segment. Activity in the unsecured segment has declined significantly over time, in the first place due to the heightened counterparty risk in the wake of the crisis. Activity in the unsecured market has stabilised but remains subdued. This is linked to the high level of excess liquidity and reduced short-term funding needs for banks, as well as, to some extent, regulatory changes affecting banks’ liquidity management. The ECB has never singled out one specific short-term interest rate as its operational target, but it is clear that the EONIA, an unsecured money market rate, has provided an important point of reference to practitioners.  The observed shift of activity from the unsecured to the secured market raises a number of important questions. For instance: Do unsecured rates still have the same information content as before the crisis? Is the arbitrage between secured and unsecured rates working efficiently? And, should the central bank focus more on steering secured rather than unsecured rates? In this regard it is also relevant that we have seen some divergence between secured and unsecured rates, which also relates to some extent to our monetary policy measures. While the ECB deposit facility rate has provided a floor for the EONIA, certain repo rates have come to trade significantly below OIS rates, especially for repos secured by collateral of the highest credit quality. This reflects to some extent our monetary policy measures. By removing securities from the market, the ensuing scarcity exerts downward pressure on repo rates. For instance, specialness premia tend to be higher in those market segments where the Eurosystem has purchased more bonds relative to outstanding amounts. Differentiation within the secured segments Even looking at the unsecured segment, we see some differentiation of transaction rates, which results to some extent from the way the liquidity created by our measures interacts with market participants’ access to our deposit facility. While unsecured trading between banks with access to our deposit facility is taking place above the deposit facility rate, institutions without access are willing to lend at rates below the deposit facility rate. The distribution of liquidity to entities without access to the deposit facility is amplified by our asset purchases, which mechanically channel liquidity to large financial institutions located outside of the euro area.  The phenomenon that we see of money market rates below policy rates is not unique to the euro area, but is visible in most, if not all, cases where asset purchases have significantly ramped up excess liquidity. Take for example the US, where the Federal Funds rate is trading below the Fed’s Interest Rate on Excess Reserves. This is due to the fact that the Fed Funds Rate to a significant extent reflects transactions between banks that can earn interest on reserves and Federal Home Loan Banks that cannot. Moreover, as US repo rates traded at even lower levels to the extent that they largely reflect trades with non-banks that do not hold a Fed account such as government sponsored entities and money market funds, the Fed introduced its overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations (RRPs), which has allowed it to effectively steer money market rates and engineer a successful lift-off of rates. In the euro area, institutions without access to the deposit facility currently lend in money markets at rates below the deposit facility rate to those that have access to the facility. These low rates can be seen as reflecting the continued very accommodative stance of monetary policy. This situation, however, is worth studying further, as it is relevant when thinking about the operational framework in the longer run. Conclusion The brighter economic prospects have increased our confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation towards our aim. At the same time, a substantial amount of monetary accommodation continues to be necessary to secure the gradual convergence of inflation towards our inflation aim.  The continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates.  To this end, an effective transmission of our monetary support through the money market remains essential. I thus look forward to hearing back about the discussions which you will be having about money markets. I think it is very useful and important that this workshop brings together academics, central bankers and market practitioners, which provides for a variety of perspectives. I wish you a very productive workshop.

      "['2017-11-03', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'Monetary policy, exchange rates and capital flows', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 18th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference hosted by the International Monetary Fund, Washington D.C., 3 November 2017', '  Monetary policy, exchange rates and capital flows   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 18th Jacques Polak Annual Research Conference hosted by the International Monetary Fund, Washington D.C., 3 November 2017 Central bank asset purchase programmes are often catalysts for significant cross-border capital flows.  [1] By compressing the (excess) return on domestic bonds, they encourage investors to rebalance their portfolios towards foreign, higher yielding assets.[2] Such capital flows have reached historical dimensions in the case of the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP), with both resident and non-resident investors moving out of euro-denominated securities and into bonds issued predominantly by the safest non-euro area sovereigns. I examined these flows in detail in a recent speech at the ECB’s Foreign Exchange Contact Group meeting.[3]  One intriguing observation I made in this speech was that there was no evidence of a causal link between such capital flows and exchange rate movements. Findings based on event studies instead suggest that, around the time of central bank asset purchase announcements, investors price the exchange rate mainly on the basis of the information these programmes provide to markets about the expected future path of short-term interest rates. In this sense, the effect of asset purchases on exchange rates is not fundamentally different from that of conventional interest rate policy. Today I would like to build on this previous contribution and provide further insights into the channels through which central bank asset purchase programmes are likely to affect the exchange rate. I will provide suggestive evidence that challenges the widely held view in the event-study literature that policy-induced portfolio rebalancing does not affect the exchange rate.[4] My remarks therefore confirm that portfolio rebalancing is a major transmission channel of central bank asset purchase programmes and provide some tentative support to theories of exchange rate determination in imperfect financial markets, which give a first-order role to capital flows.[5]  Unlike private portfolio rebalancing, however, central bank asset purchase programmes can be anticipated by investors. This means that exchange rates should adjust in a way that clears the expected future supply of and demand for currency resulting from anticipated cross-border capital flows. The implication is that asset purchase programmes may, at times, break the link between future expected short-term rates and the exchange rate.  Before developing this argument in more detail, allow me to reiterate at this point that the exchange rate is not a policy target for the ECB. It is one channel of transmission through which our monetary policy actions achieve price stability in the medium term, in both conventional and unconventional times. It is therefore important that practitioners and academics alike better understand how this channel propagates policy stimulus through financial markets, within and across economies.  The zero lower bound, forward guidance and exchange rates  Let me start by briefly recalling the two main propositions I made in my earlier remarks in July. One was that there is compelling empirical evidence that central bank asset purchase programmes are often associated with substantial cross-border capital flows. My first slide illustrates this point quite clearly for the euro area.     The second proposition was that asset purchases affect the exchange rate in broadly the same way as conventional monetary policy – that is, through expectations of interest rate differentials. To date, there is very little evidence to suggest that currency movements are a direct consequence of the impact on the supply of and demand for currency when investors rebalance their portfolios across borders. It is this second proposition that I would like to examine today in greater detail.  In doing so, it is helpful to start by recalling the basic relationship between exchange rates and interest rate movements. I do this on the second slide. On the left-hand side you can see that, in the past, there has often been an intimate relationship between short-term interest rate differentials – measured here using bonds with a maturity of two years – and movements in the exchange rate, at least for the euro and US dollar pair. The correlation between the two series was a remarkable 0.85 during the period 2005 to 2011.    Admittedly, academics typically take this correlation much less seriously than practitioners. It is a good habit of academics to dismiss contemporaneous correlations between two variables as spurious. If anything, standard theory – also known as uncovered interest parity (UIP) – predicts a correlation between today’s interest rate differentials and tomorrow’s exchange rate changes, thereby discrediting any perceived contemporaneous causality.  Other approaches are less dismissive, however. The “asset market approach” to exchange rates, for example – which, in essence, is an alternative representation of the UIP – posits that, as an asset price, exchange rates should fully reflect today’s expectations about the future, just as equity prices reflect the expected discounted stream of future earnings and other relevant information.[6]  The implication is that the current level of the exchange rate should be a function of the average of current and future expected short-term interest rates. And because monetary policy, away from the zero lower bound, predominantly sends signals about the current level of central bank interest rates, and because the term premium – the additional return that investors demand for the risks incurred by not simply rolling over a series of short-term bonds – was typically contained at shorter horizons, it is not surprising to see a strong correlation between short-term interest rates and the exchange rate. Long-term interest rate differentials, by contrast, have usually carried less informational content to explain exchange rate movements. You can see this on the right-hand side of this slide. There was a connection, but it was looser, around 0.65, likely reflecting the growing role of term premia along the term structure of interest rates.[7]  So, prima facie, empirical evidence suggests that monetary policy, by influencing short-term interest rate differentials, could directly affect the exchange rate and, hence, real activity and prices. A natural question to ask, then, is whether monetary policy may have lost some of its potency once interest rates reached the zero lower bound. That is, policy might have become less effective once it started working its way mainly through long-term, rather than short-term, interest rates, via, for example, sovereign bond purchases.  Simple visual inspection of the chart on the left suggests it has indeed. As two-year interest rates approached the zero lower bound – around end-2011 – their correlation with the exchange rate effectively broke down. Long-term rates, at least initially, also seem to have provided little to no information as to where the exchange rate was heading, as the chart on the right suggests. This interpretation warrants closer inspection, however, as this period coincided with the growing use of unconventional monetary policy measures by central banks worldwide. Indeed, I will argue that in order to understand how unconventional policy affects the exchange rate at, or close to, the lower bound, it is useful to break down long-term yields into their two main components – the expectations component and the term premium. Slide 3 shows the insights that can be gained from this breakdown. Here I focus on the period 2012 to 2014. During this period, short-term rates barely moved, as you saw on the previous slide, while the long-term interest rate differential was by and large disconnected from exchange rate movements – you can see this clearly again on the left-hand side.     But now consider the right-hand chart. Here I plot the exchange rate against the differential of the expectations component of ten-year interest rates as extracted from dynamic term structure models.[8] Put simply, it is the same ten-year rate differential as on the left-hand chart, only corrected for the term premium estimate. The correlation during 2012 and 2013 is compelling, at around 0.75. Shortly before the crisis, in 2005 and 2006, the correlation was less than 0.4. Incidentally, the close relationship coincides with a considerable strengthening of central banks’ forward guidance on interest rates. The Federal Reserve, for example, introduced date-based forward guidance in mid-2011 and adopted state-contingent guidance in late 2012. The ECB, for its part, introduced rate forward guidance for the first time in July 2013, one year before it announced its credit easing programme. So, what could have happened is that market participants, trusting central banks’ forward guidance that policy rates would stay at very low levels for an extended period, were increasingly pricing exchange rates on the basis of information about how policy would evolve in the more distant future. That is, with short-term rates broadly stable, the weight investors attached to the expected future path mechanically increased – just as theory would predict.[9]  Term structure models can therefore provide compelling evidence that exchange rates remain deeply connected to monetary policy also when interest rates are at, or close to, the effective lower bound, even if interest rate differentials per se suggest a structural break in the relationship. Asset purchases and exchange rates But the right-hand chart also suggests that this is not the full story. A clear break emerged in late 2013. And that break is likely related to the second policy instrument I mentioned before, namely asset purchases. Although asset purchases, by removing duration risk from the market, act primarily on the term premium, they also entail a strong signalling channel, in particular at, or close to, turning points.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s decision to start tapering in December 2013 triggered an appreciable increase in future expected short-term rates. You can see on the right-hand side that the ten-year expectations component differential vis-à-vis the euro area widened by more than 50 basis points in just a few months. This should have caused the US dollar to appreciate, at least on the basis of past behaviour.  The dollar defied upward pressure, however. It continued to depreciate persistently, despite the marked widening in future expected interest rates. One reason why this might have been the case is that the signalling and the portfolio rebalancing channels of asset purchases might have worked in opposite directions. In imperfect markets, investors may give different weights to conflicting information.  What I mean by this is that, despite expectations of a significant increase in policy rates, the Federal Reserve’s very gradual slowdown of its pace of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases – which caught many investors on the wrong foot after the “taper tantrum” – possibly fuelled expectations that long-term rates, and hence also foreign demand for US-denominated interest-bearing assets, would remain contained for a considerable period.  This interpretation is consistent with at least four observations: first, term premia on US bonds fell notably after the Federal Reserve started tapering in December 2013, pointing to a correction of the sharp uptick in term premia after the “taper tantrum”.[10] Second, investors did not expect the US dollar to appreciate. CFTC data show that they continued to hold net short speculative positions in the US dollar well into 2014. Third, capital inflows into the US Treasury market did indeed decelerate somewhat during the first half of 2014, validating earlier expectations. And, fourth, the dollar started to appreciate only once expectations about asset purchases in the euro area gained a strong tailwind during the second half of 2014. Here the temporal coincidence is striking. The moment the ECB announced its credit easing programme in June 2014, which many observers considered to be a harbinger of sovereign bond purchases, and moved rates into negative territory, the dollar started to appreciate significantly against the euro.  In less than two and a half months, the euro lost nearly 10% in value. Net euro short positions jumped to close to record highs in the space of a few weeks. In other words, only the prospect of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB seems to have led to a reappraisal by market participants of future domestic and foreign demand for US Treasuries.[11]  Empirical analysis on the direction of international spillovers in bond markets corroborates this view. On slide 4 you can see that ECB researchers, using the Diebold-Yilmaz methodology, find that spillovers from the euro area to the United States spiked sharply in mid-2014.[12] According to this methodology, euro area spillovers accounted for more than half of the variance in US Treasuries in the second half of 2014.    Put differently, in the presence of asset purchase programmes, the portfolio rebalancing channel, rather than the signalling channel, might ultimately rise to become the dominant driver of exchange rates, at least temporarily. Expectations of compressed term premia, either through central bank actions directly, or through cross-border capital flows associated with such programmes, or both, can offset, or mitigate, the impact of changes in the expectations about future short-term rates on exchange rates. Disconnects may also be the result of market segmentation, much in line with the view that the financial market comprises a heterogeneous set of actors with very different beliefs and expectations. Indeed, the same chart suggests that spillovers from the euro area to the US bond market had already accelerated sharply in the first half of 2014. So, a good part of the decline in US term premia during this period – you can see this on the right-hand side – might in fact have reflected expectations about monetary easing in the euro area, paired with a reappraisal of the Federal Reserve’s policies.  In other words, during this period participants in the bond market might have held, on average, a different view on the prospects of global monetary policy from that of their counterparts in the foreign exchange market, which maintained sizeable net long positions in the euro. Christopher Sim’s “rational inattention” comes to mind.[13]  This can also be seen on the next slide. Here I show a breakdown of the historical drivers of the euro and US dollar exchange rate based on a Bayesian VAR developed by researchers at the ECB.[14] The shocks are identified using standard sign restrictions. The breakdown suggests that, by contrast with the spillovers we saw in the previous chart, monetary policy shocks seem to have contributed comparatively little to exchange rate movements in the first half of 2014.[15]     Instead, an exogenous shock, which can be interpreted in the context of this discussion as a time-varying risk premium shock, appears to have put mainly downward pressure on the dollar. To the extent that risk premium and bond term premium shocks are driven by the same fundamentals, this would be consistent with the view that the signalling and portfolio rebalancing channels were sending conflicting signals. This train of thought is in fact very similar to the view put forward by Charles Engel and Kenneth West on the relationship between risk premia and the exchange rate.[16] They saw the dollar depreciation in 2007 as evidence of investors thinking “this is a US crisis”. And they saw the dollar appreciation in 2008 as a change in this thinking to “well, this is actually more of a global crisis”. As with the events of 2007-08, what ultimately caused the initial resilience of the dollar and the sharp fall in term premia in 2014 will remain a matter of speculation. Factors other than the actions of the Federal Reserve and the ECB are likely to have contributed to these developments. But that is not my point. My point is rather that it is not surprising that central bank asset purchases may break with some of the regularities we have become used to.  The reason is that asset purchases are monetary policy actions that can be anticipated by market participants, just like changes in key policy rates. Unlike conventional monetary policy, however, they have direct implications for the expected supply of and demand for internationally traded bonds and, hence, for the level of the exchange rate that, all other things being equal, clears the resulting capital flows.  This may, at times, break the link between future expected rates and the exchange rate. This is clearly visible when we look at slide 6. The chart is based on the same methodology as the spillover chart on slide 4, but it illustrates how much, on average, of the variance in long-term bond yields in one country can be explained by the other country’s term premium and expected short-term rates respectively.     You can see that the moment short-term yields hit the zero lower bound, spillovers in bond markets by and large reflected term premia movements – in both directions. These spillovers may pull the exchange rate away from the path implied by expectations about the future short-term rate. The extent of the decoupling, in turn, will depend on the expected direction, persistence and degree of international spillovers – something that is inherently difficult to project and price.  In this sense, the implications are very similar to those described by Xavier Gabaix and Matteo Maggiori in their 2015 Quarterly Journal of Economics article, which states that the risk-bearing capacity of financial intermediaries provides a role for capital flows to affect the exchange rate.[17] The difference is only that if asset purchases are understood by investors to be part of the reaction function of central banks, then the exchange rate can be expected to adjust before capital flows take place. This is certainly what we have seen in the euro area.  This also means that we should treat more carefully findings in the event-study literature that assign most of the observed exchange rate change around central bank asset purchase announcements to the signalling channel.[18] Given that intermediaries are forward-looking but constrained by their balance sheets, policy-induced exchange rate changes can also be expected to reflect expectations of future cross-border capital flows and their associated impact on the future supply of and demand for currency.  In this sense, the debate also shares some similarities with a related strand of the literature, namely the transmission channels of sterilised foreign exchange interventions. The view that such interventions are effective mainly by signalling future policy intentions is frequently challenged by empirical evidence suggesting that portfolio rebalancing may have economically relevant effects.[19]  Of course, this does not mean that understanding the potential spillovers of central bank asset purchase programmes is enough to explain exchange rate movements. Changes in relative term premia are far more difficult to interpret than changes in the expected path of future short-term interest rates. The latter can be clearly associated with changes in monetary policy expectations. Changes in term premia, by contrast, often reflect a combination of shocks, including monetary policy shocks as well as shocks to demand, risk aversion and other variables, which will drive term premia in the same or in opposite directions. The most recent disconnect between the euro and US dollar exchange rate and the expected future short-term interest rate differential is a case in point. On the left-hand side of slide 7 you can see that a significant gap between the two series re-emerged in the spring of this year, and continues to persist.    It is tempting to link recent developments once more to portfolio rebalancing considerations. After all, the Federal Reserve is now actively reducing its balance sheet, while the ECB last week decided to extend its asset purchase programme by nine months, or more, if needed, while reducing the monthly pace to €30 billion. This might have caused some investors to expect a gradual rebalancing of portfolios away from US dollar-denominated assets and towards euro-denominated assets, which would support the euro. But many other factors may drive interest and exchange rates, with likely different implications for the real economy.[20] Indeed, geopolitical and policy uncertainties may also contribute to swings in bond term premia. So it is difficult to establish unequivocal links. But, if we look at the right-hand side of this slide, it is intriguing to see such a close relationship between the exchange rate and relative bond term premia differential as that observed during the course of this year.  Conclusion Let me conclude. Deciphering exchange rate movements, and giving them a structural interpretation, remains a topic that requires the dedication and passion of many researchers. Much has already been learned, but much still remains to be understood. The introduction of unconventional monetary policy measures forces us to think more deeply about the channels through which such measures affect the exchange rate, with regard to their impact both on the expected future path of short-term interest rates and on risk premia. An important aspect in this endeavour is to gain a better understanding of the role of portfolio rebalancing. Evidence is growing, and my remarks today are intended to add to this, that portfolio rebalancing is a major transmission channel of central bank asset purchases. At the same time, the signalling and portfolio rebalancing channels of central bank asset purchase programmes might, at times, work in opposite directions, with unclear implications for the exchange rate.  Moreover, in an integrated global financial system, unconventional policy measures have been shown to often trigger large cross-border capital flows. To the extent that such policies can be anticipated by market participants, financial intermediaries could be expected to price in the resulting shift in the relative supply of and demand for currency before capital flows take place. As a consequence, international portfolio rebalancing considerations may, at times, drive a wedge between expected future short-term rates and the exchange rate. My remarks today are by no means conclusive and they are based on tentative evidence. But I hope that they provide impetus to further, more systematic research on a topic that is not only intriguing from an intellectual perspective, but also of significant relevance to policymakers in their efforts to improve the understanding of the transmission channels of non-standard monetary policy measures.

Keynote Address by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 5th Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy, organised by the SAFE Policy Center of Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, 27 October 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers Jan-Peter Krahnen and Hans-Helmut Kotz for inviting me to speak at the fifth edition of the Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy. The theme of the conference is well-chosen. Despite significant improvements to its architecture over recent years, there is a clear sense that Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, remains incomplete. There is much less clarity and precious little agreement on what a complete EMU would look like, however. This is why the question posed by the organisers – “how much federalism” – is so relevant. In my remarks, I would like to first review how federalism has evolved in the EU, highlighting that it is as much a process as it is an end-state. I will then – drawing on the economic concept of fiscal federalism – look more at the question of “how much federalism”, focusing on issue of risk-sharing and the role of different levels of governance within EMU. Federalism in the EU The nature of the discussion on federalism in Europe has changed quite dramatically over time. Shortly after the Second World War, the ambition for some was to create a “United States of Europe”, mainly as a way to avoid renewed, devastating war.  This vision was shared by those who laid the foundations of the European Union in the 1950s, most notably Jean Monnet, the first President of the European Coal and Steel Community. From today’s perspective, it may seem surprising that the start of such a grand project was confined to an area as specific as coal and steel. But Monnet and the other early architects of European integration clearly understood that political federalism was the end-point of long process, which had to be achieved incrementally and through focused actions in limited policy areas where the benefits of European cooperation could be clearly seen. To quote one of Monnet’s contemporaries, Alcide de Gasperi,“we must begin by pooling only what is strictly essential to the achievement of our immediate aims, and do this by means of flexible formulae which can be gradually and progressively applied”.  For these “fathers of Europe”, however, it was self-evident that such incremental measures would gradually move Europe deeper into federalism. Indeed, this clear sense of direction was, in their way, a key motor to keep the integration process moving forward.  Since then, the European integration process has tended to move in waves. There have been times when it has stalled, such as the during the “empty chair crisis” in the 1960s. And there have been times when it has unexpectedly sped ahead, such as with the launch of the Single Market Act in the 1980s, and the commitment to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in the 1990s. But today, there is some confusion as to where we stand.  In some ways, the degree of ambition to achieve a full political federation seems to have become more limited, which has led some to wonder whether the integration process will lose its forward momentum. This reflects in part the failure of the Constitution for Europe in 2005. The unsuccessful referendums in France and the Netherlands can be interpreted in different ways, but they clearly suggested that the people of the European Union were not ready to embark on the road towards full political federalism – or at least not at that point in time. It is also fair to say that the appetite for such federalism today is not much different from in 2005. In recent years there have been growing doubts about the European project.  At the same time, polls consistently show that European citizens support federal decision-making in a wide range of areas, ranging from energy to migration to the fight against terrorism. This reflects the fact that the benefits of federalism are much broader than its economic, fiscal and monetary dimensions. Indeed, since the EU was originally devised as a peace-keeping device, it is not surprising that one of the early initiatives for European integration was a motion to establish a European Defence Community, although this failed in 1954. While a full defence union is probably still unrealistic, there are increasing signs that further integration in this area could happen in the near future.  The Commission reflection paper published on 7 June of this year lays out proposals for establishing a European Defence Fund, which could form the nucleus of a future defence union. Last week, the European Council welcomed the significant progress made by Member States in preparing a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in the field of defence, and the work done on the Commission’s proposal for a European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP). All this clearly chimes with the preferences of European citizens, three-quarters of whom support “a common defence and security policy among EU Member States”.[1]  The conclusion that follows is that we have to distinguish federalism as a state from federalism as a process. It may be the case that a full political federation is not currently desired by European citizens. But that does not mean that they reject the process of federalism – which is to say, the dynamic allocation and reallocation of responsibilities to different levels of government according to the preferences and needs of the time. While this process may benefit from the gravitational pull of a pre-defined end point, it can also advance without it, so long as actions are taken in areas where the benefits of cooperation are clear and the steps taken are legitimate in the eyes of citizens. Indeed, what gave the EU both momentum and popular legitimacy in the years after the war was its achievements – effective actions in specific areas – not necessarily the visions of a unified Europe. So how much federalism would satisfy these requirements today? One way to assess this is through looking at the economic aspects of federalism. Certainly, as Richard and Peggy Musgrave wrote, “economic analysis does not tell us what degree of closeness the member units of a federation should feel toward each other”. Political aspects transcend economic ones. But economic analysis can help us better understand the consequences of various institutional arrangements and choose the instruments we should use to pursue our common objectives. In the rest of my remarks I will zoom in on some of these aspects of federalism. Economic aspects of federalism An important theme – one aspect of which will be addressed in the first session today – is risk-sharing. The crisis has reminded us that both private and public risk-sharing are underdeveloped in Europe, and that this underdevelopment comes at huge cost. So, there is general agreement that risk-sharing channels need to be improved. There is less agreement on where the emphasis should lie. Some argue that the priority should be to strengthen private risk-sharing, by completing the banking union and establishing a truly integrated capital markets union. Others argue that EMU needs to focus on public risk-sharing, be it through introducing a central euro area fiscal capacity or creating safe assets. In reality, separating these two channels of risk-sharing is far from the obvious solution. Is private risk-sharing a substitute for public risk-sharing? Or do they complement each other? There are several arguments in support of the view that the two channels complement each other – but only if the right powers are matched at the federal level. For example, it is clear that the banking union would not fully achieve its goal of severing the toxic link between banks and national governments without a central fiscal backstop for the already-existing Single Resolution Fund, as well as for the European Deposit Insurance Scheme that is still under discussion. At the same time, fiscal backstops generally raise legitimate questions about incentive structures to protect taxpayers, which need to be addressed in parallel by appropriate fiscal governance at the federal level. The process of building the banking union also illustrates how important it is to reach an appropriate degree of federalism to achieve the objective of a stable and integrated financial system that supports the European economy. Ideally, in a genuine banking union banks would operate in the Single Market just as they operate in their domestic market. This is essential to reap the full benefits of financial integration. The country in which a bank is headquartered should be irrelevant. But, in practice, it remains relevant for as long as the consequences of potential bank failures are still predominantly national. The irrelevance of a bank’s headquarters, therefore, depends on the institutional structure of the banking union. Let me take one very specific example to illustrate my point. The banking union is not yet considered a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology applied to globally systematically important banks. These G-SIBs are subject to additional capital requirements, which are calibrated on the basis of a cross-jurisdictional indicator. This indicator reflects the fact that failures of global banks are more difficult to handle owing to coordination difficulties and cross-border spillover effects. When the responsibility for banks is shared, additional capital buffers for cross-border activities lose their raison d’être. A single set of harmonised prudential rules for all banks in the European Union would not, in and of itself, be sufficient for the EU to be considered as a single geographical area. But the Single Rulebook, the existence of a single supervisor, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), of a single resolution authority, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), and of a common backstop, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), when taken together, have equipped the banking union with all the features of a single geographical area. This should mean that the banking union is treated as a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology in future. Finally, there is the question of how to design fiscal risk-sharing mechanisms for EMU, while taking into account EMU’s unique nature. In existing federations the stabilisation function of the central budget is usually a by-product of redistribution via large tax transfer systems. At this stage of European integration, it is clear that any politically acceptable euro area fiscal capacity will be modest in size. So, the key question for the economics profession is whether it is possible to remove the link between the stabilisation function and the redistributive function, allowing for a central budget of moderate size to have a meaningful macroeconomic stabilisation effect. If this were possible, such a central budget could help monetary policy, especially in times of deep recessions when nominal interest rates may reach their effective lower bound. The European Commission set out some proposals in its reflection paper published on 31 May – these require further study. Conclusion Let me conclude. The answer to the question of today’s conference – “How much federalism?” – is not easy. Yet, speaking as an economist, I think it is likely that the right answer lies on the side of “more than today” rather than “less than today”.  Monnet famously said that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” He was certainly right that further integration will proceed incrementally rather than in a big bang. What I hope, though, is that Europe will not be forged in crises only. Significant progress towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union has been achieved in times of acute crisis. Today’s improved economic environment offers a window of opportunity to demonstrate that progress is possible in quieter times, too. I thank you for your attention and hope you have productive discussions at today’s conference.      [1] Standard Eurobarometer 87, Spring 2017 (fieldwork: May 2017).     ']\n",
      "['2017-10-18', 'Mario Draghi', 'Structural reforms in the euro area', 'Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB conference “Structural reforms in the euro area”, Frankfurt am Main, 18 October 2017', '  Structural reforms in the euro area   Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB conference “Structural reforms in the euro area”, Frankfurt am Main, 18 October 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you all to this conference on structural reforms in the euro area.  As you know, “structural reforms” has become something of a contested term in recent years. For many, it describes a pragmatic policy agenda to raise long-term growth and accelerate adjustment to shocks, which is essential for countries in a monetary union.  But for others, the term is viewed as a “catch-all” for a wide range of policies, some of which have potentially negative short-run costs and adverse distributional effects. In view of these discussions, it is important to assess – first – whether countries with more flexible structures and more resilient institutions do indeed recover more quickly from shocks and grow faster over the cycle. Second, we should evaluate how the design of reforms and the overall policy mix affect the impact of structural policies, especially during a downturn.  And third, we should assess the distributional effects of reforms, and consider how we can ensure that they benefit everyone in society. These are the themes I will focus on in my remarks this morning.  Economic structures, adjustment to shocks and long-term growth First of all, the crisis has helped us better understand a key question for the euro area: are economies that are more flexible also more resilient to adverse shocks, and do they experience faster recoveries and higher long-term growth? By and large, the experience of the crisis has shown the answer to be “yes”. What we have seen is that more economic flexibility and sound institutions do lead to more resilience and higher long-term growth, including when countries face a common shock.  Indeed, euro area economies that were more flexible at the start of the crisis – as measured by the World Bank Doing Business Indicator in 2009 – subsequently showed a stronger recovery. GDP per capita rebounded faster and unemployment fell more.[1]  And looking at the last 15 to 20 years – so over the full cycle – euro area countries with sound economic structures at the outset have shown much higher long-term real growth.\\xa0 Confirming this relationship, countries that reformed their product and labour markets during the crisis have also seen good results afterwards – and the full effects are still materialising.  Focusing just on the labour market, a number of countries have implemented reforms in recent years which have helped to reduce unemployment – most visibly Spain and Portugal, but also Italy. [2] These reforms also seem to have made unemployment more responsive to growth.[3]  Structural policies are a main factor explaining these positive developments. But of course supportive financial and macroeconomic policies have been vital, too. New research also finds that labour market reforms in the euro area reduce the dispersion of unemployment and GDP across member countries following a common shock, making the single monetary policy more effective for everyone.[4]  But it is clear that, to get the best results, there has to be some broad coordination among countries. Labour market reforms can emphasise more wage adjustment or more employment adjustment, and countries will only converge in their response to shocks if they have a broadly similar mix. [5]  This underscores why the European Semester process is crucial – not only for encouraging structural reforms, but also for ensuring some degree of beneficial consistency between them. Lessons on the composition of reforms and their interaction with macro policies Still, even if some countries have had positive experiences with reforms during the crisis, we know that for others it has been more difficult. This brings me to my second theme about the design and implementation of reforms.  There are three key areas where lessons can be drawn: the packaging of reforms, their scope and the macro-policy mix that accompanies them. First, the packaging of reforms is crucial for reducing their short-term adjustment costs.  Unlike what happened in the years even before the crisis, labour market reforms must be preceded – or least accompanied by – product market reforms, otherwise wage adjustments will not be fully passed on to prices. Instead, profit mark-ups will rise and the purchasing power of households will fall, thereby worsening the economic conditions of consumers and aggravating any recession.[6]  During the crisis, because of powerful vested interests, labour market reforms were not accompanied by product market reforms in some countries, and so wages fell and prices did not adjust in tandem.  The key question is then: how do we make sure that product market reforms do indeed take place? While there are no easy answers, IMF research suggests a central part of the answer may be carefully designed fiscal incentives to soften the blow for those affected. In the past, Germany, Ireland and the UK have all successfully used such incentives to bring about these reforms.[7]  The second area where we have learned lessons from the crisis is the scope of reforms. Much of the focus in the reform debate has been on product and labour markets. But what is often forgotten is the scope for progress by reforming public administration and the business environment.  These reforms are effective at all points of the cycle, since they entail very few short-term costs. In fact, lessening the time it takes to open a business, or speeding up judicial processes, should yield immediate net gains. And institutional reforms also act as a multiplier for other reform efforts by improving the implementation and enforcement of those measures.  In light of this, many countries have successfully introduced more broad-based reforms during the crisis. But there are still large gains that could be achieved.  Published research and internal Eurosystem simulations show that improved economic structures and institutions could result in significantly higher GDP in the long run, depending on the specific reforms and approach used.[8] It has also been estimated that sound economic structures could reduce the probability of a severe recession by around 20%.[9]  The final area where we have learned about reform strategy is the overall policy mix. The crisis has lent weight to the view that a supportive macro-policy mix leads to improved reform implementation.[10] The IMF finds that, where countries have fiscal space, temporary public spending can ease the transitional costs of some reforms. This is then paid for in the medium term when the growth benefits of those reforms kick in and fiscal positions improve.[11]  Fiscal incentives have also been shown to improve the effectiveness of reforms. The Italian “Jobs Act” in 2015, for example, has been followed by an increase of almost half a million in the number of people employed with a permanent job contract, in large part because hiring subsidies encouraged firms to take on more people under the new open-ended contract.[12]  Perhaps more controversial in recent years has been the question of the interaction between monetary policy and structural reforms. It is often said that monetary policy discourages reforms by taking the pressure off governments to act during crisis times.  But ECB research finds no convincing evidence that high interest rates lead to more reforms, if one controls for the business cycle and other factors. In fact, the opposite is more likely to be true: lower rates tend to promote reforms, since they lead to a better macroeconomic environment.[13] This is especially useful for countries without the fiscal space to support demand. The challenge of pairing reforms with inclusiveness But we have also learned something else from the crisis: highlighting the benefits of reforms in terms of growth is not enough to make them widely acceptable to the public. We also need to take into account the inclusiveness of economic policies. As we all know, there is an increasing perception that growth in the past has not been sufficiently inclusive, and was not always associated with rising living standards for everyone. This has fuelled the belief that some have been “left behind” by the spread of market forces.  In this context, the case for structural reforms needs to go beyond their efficiency benefits. We need to show that reforms can contribute to both efficiency and equity.  One way this can be achieved is by focusing more on reforms with positive distributional effects.  Tackling rent-seeking in some product markets tends to benefit those at the lower end of the income scale, since such reforms lead to lower prices and increased consumption choices, and therefore improve the welfare and purchasing power of poorer people in particular.[14]  Addressing tax avoidance and evasion would also help reduce inequality. Indeed, the payoff of efforts in this area can be significant. In 2015, EU countries lost around 12% of total expected revenues in value-added tax, partly because of tax evasion and inadequate tax collection systems.[15]  Still, some reforms will always have negative distributional effects, at least in the short term.[16] But in these cases we can do more to reduce inequality by ensuring that flexibility is combined with security. Inclusive labour markets are ones with well-functioning active labour market policies that allow people to reskill, and proactive macroeconomic policies that shorten job transitions. Before the crisis, several countries introduced labour market reforms to increase flexibility, but did little to make their labour markets more secure. This ended up disproportionately penalising young people, who had weak job protections and meagre support during unemployment.  As I said in a recent speech in Ireland, young people do not want to live on subsidies. They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities.[17]\\xa0So we should never think that simply compensating the “losers” of reforms is enough. Public policies have to be designed to help people back into work, and into jobs where they can develop and refine their skills.  Given the ongoing polarisation of skills in labour markets, this points to the crucial importance of strong education and training systems. Job polarisation is not just putting increasing pressure on workers with mid-level skills, but also complicating the possibilities for unskilled workers to find more skilled jobs, meaning that they continue to be trapped in low-paid jobs.[18]  The main answer is education and training that disseminates marketable skills more widely. Otherwise, there is a risk that, rather than being seen as an agent of jobs and opportunity, structural reforms are seen as a catalyst for a low-wage, precarious economy.  Conclusion Let me sum up. The crisis has confirmed that more flexible economies are more resilient, especially for countries that are part of a monetary union. Lessons about how to design and implement reforms so as to maximise their benefits and minimise their short-term costs should be put into practice.  Reforms have to take into account equity as well as efficiency. Vested interests have to be tackled and those who have lost out given proper support.  With monetary policy being accommodative, we now have a window of opportunity to take these measures. I hope the insights at this conference can move this agenda forward.      [1] This holds true for both the countries that joined the euro area early on (by 2001) and the former communist countries that joined later. However, for a given “Doing Business” level (World Bank measure of business regulations) the latter group seem to have generally outperformed the former, possibly due to their larger catching-up potential.

The world economy is going through a period of sustained moderate growth. In particular, the cyclical recovery in the euro area is now stronger and broad-based, driven by a virtuous circle of employment creation and private consumption. All member countries are experiencing economic growth, the significant current account deficits at the beginning of the crisis in various countries have turned into surpluses, and in public finance most countries previously under stress are now showing positive primary surpluses. Since mid-2013, almost seven million jobs have been created, offsetting the losses during the peak of the crisis and unemployment is at its lowest level since 2008, albeit still quite high. Business confidence is the highest in a decade suggesting that we can expect a continued and resilient recovery in the coming quarters. These developments were and are still strongly supported by the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy after the second recession in 2012-2013.  Notwithstanding these developments, there are concerns regarding possible financial instability stemming from international market developments that could lead to price corrections. Signs of general overvaluation in asset prices are however not present in the euro area. There are localised asset price pressures in a few national housing markets and, in particular, in the commercial property market. As a result, several countries have adopted macroprudential policies and are dealing successfully with those tensions.  The overall financial stability situation in the euro area is therefore positive and well underpinned by the improved fundamentals of our economies. Improvements indicate that the euro area is now much more resilient and better prepared to cope with potential financial shocks that may very well happen in the near future. The more significant risk in the horizon is a possible reversal of risk assessment in international financial markets with the consequent asset price downward corrections. The ensuing capital losses incurred by asset holders, including many financial institutions, would have negative wealth and demand effects. The increase in bond yields would put pressure on the more indebted economic agents. Part of the possible price corrections are however associated with the improved economic situation that will eventually lead to higher nominal growth, thus contributing to debt sustainability. One of the suggested triggers of market corrections is the recalibration of monetary policies that is gradually starting to take place in different degrees across important jurisdictions. There are two points worthwhile making in this respect. The first is that, in spite of being widely predicted in market commentary, very little is happening in financial markets to anticipate it. Market participants who are supposed to be forward looking, do not seem to anticipate material changes in asset prices. The second is that this disconnect between market commentary and concrete market decisions, could indicate that the simple recalibration of monetary policies is expected to be smoothly absorbed without generating undue turbulence. Naturally, for this to be possible, monetary policy recalibration must be quite gradual. That will be the case of the ECB as we have already said that anyhow “monetary policy will continue to be very accommodative” until we achieve our goals. If central banks adopt cautious strategies, then presumably only a significant geo-political event could trigger more material changes in financial and economic conditions. Nevertheless, one knows that markets are unpredictable and can overshoot, especially in situations like the present one with many risks and a protracted period of very low volatility in asset prices. In the remainder of my remarks today, I will address the evolution of the pricing of risk in the equity and bond markets during the crisis and its aftermath. This will provide the rationale for the drivers of the possible incoming changes. I will then reflect on the consequences for the different asset markets and their respective impact on the various economic agents. I will end with a brief analysis of what macroprudential policies can do and are doing to safeguard financial stability in the euro area.  Behaviour towards risk  As expected, the crisis led to a significant rise in risk aversion and a generalised preference for safety. The depth of the crisis has left behind profound scars not only in the economies’ productive capacity but also in the minds and behaviour of economic agents concerning risk. The memory of the unexpected materialisation of tail risks lingers. The preference for safety is partly responsible for the excess demand for safe assets, for the increase of the equity risk premium, for the reluctance to invest in real productive assets and for the persistent sluggishness of wages. The elasticities of wage response to the economic slack and of consumption and investment reaction to the cost of finance have both declined. As a result, the wage Phillips curve became flatter and the Investment-Saving (IS) curve has become steeper. Several factors contributed, of course, to this development, in particular, increased inequality contributes to explain higher savings and lower consumption while shrinking investment opportunities linked to secular stagnation explains lower investment.  According to the general risk return trade-off, it was to be expected that investors would demand higher returns to hold riskier assets. This can be illustrated by examining the evolution of the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) – the excess return that investing in the stock market provides over a risk-free rate – in advanced economies (Figure 1)[1] which implied an increase in the cost of equity   Figure 1  The upward trend in the ERP began already in 2000 in the wake of the Dot-com stock crash (Figure1, left-hand side (LHS)). The ex-ante ERP is the difference between the required stock returns and the risk free rate. By depicting the two components, it becomes clear that the increased ERP resulted both from an increase in the Earnings Yield (EY) and a sharp decline in the risk free rate (Figure 1, right-hand side (RHS)). Note however the more recent EY decrease (which corresponds to the inverse of the Price-Earnings (P/E) ratio). This is already reflected in the recent decrease of the ERP in the U.S. (Figure 2)[2].     Figure 2  The two relevant factors contributing to the decline of the risk free rate were the “savings glut” of the early 2000s, identified by Bernanke (2005)[3] and the scarcity of “safe assets” underlined by Caballero and Farhi (2014)[4] after the crisis. Furthermore, expansionary monetary policies were also responsible for the decline in nominal interest rates and for the impact on yields and risky asset prices via rebalancing effects, resulting from Quantitative Easing (QE). As expansionary monetary policy attempted to reduce the output gap it also helped to fill the risk gap. In order to successfully avoid a big depression, monetary policy had to lower interest rates until the zero lower bound was attained. The changes in the IS and Phillips curves have rendered the task more difficult along the way and put pressure on monetary policy to adopt more unconventional measures.  More structural elements – related to the persuasive views on secular stagnation and the effects of globalisation on inflation – helped to consolidate the notion that the advanced economies are facing a protracted period of low growth and low inflation that central banks are failing to normalise but have to continue to address. Consequently, search for yield and trust in a sort of “central banks’ put” was the prevalent narrative until last year. Markets are becoming increasingly aware that central banks will not ensure such a put and are thus starting to recalibrate policy, not least as a result of the strong recovery now ongoing.  The U.S. elections of last November had already temporarily interrupted the market’s belief of the previous narrative. At the turn of the year, the perception was formed that tax cuts and deregulation would spur U.S. growth, which would increase earnings’ yields, subsequently leading to higher inflation and higher bond yields. Consequently, we saw the beginning of a rotation from bonds to stocks with a consequent increase in stock prices and a drop in bond prices (Figure 3).      Figure 3  Asset price developments This narrative about a new reflation phase in the world economy petered out last spring, particularly in what regards bonds whose prices have slightly increased since. However, stock prices continued to increase, generating fears and warnings about a possible correction (Figure 3) especially in the U.S. where, contrary to the euro area, the cyclical adjusted price earnings is well above historical averages (Figure 4, LHS). There are already signs that markets are reflecting concerns with possible downward movements: the probability of a 10% correction in stock prices extracted from option pricing has recently increased albeit remaining quite low (see Figure 4, RHS) and the price of shortening the VIX has recently sharply increased.      Figure 4  Nevertheless, we should ponder that equity market corrections are often not very consequential as the examples of 1987 or 2000 seem to indicate. In general, it is interest rates and fixed rate debt instruments that exert a wider financial and economic impact. As I mentioned before, there are no signs of significant changes in yields despite wide expectations of monetary policy recalibration around the globe. This presumably bodes well for future central banks’ decisions. Figure 5 shows the slow and smooth market expectations extracted from the OIS curve, for future EONIA for the euro area. The EONIA is expected to go above zero only in 2019 and reach 2% in ten years-time. On the other hand, market expectations of ten years German and Spanish sovereign bonds yields five years from now are respectively 1.5 and 3.3 and only move to 1.76 and 3.9 when assessed ten years from now (Figure 5, RHS). Indeed, markets expect 10 year bond rates to remain much lower than in the past for a long period of time.     Figure 5  Yield and spreads of euro area countries’ sovereign debt have remained stable or even dropped with no signs of turbulence (Figure 6).      Figure 6  While these developments are supported by the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy, they also result from the deep adjustment undergone by the countries that were under stress during the crisis. The change in policies and the structural reforms implemented contributed to a notable reduction both in their external and fiscal imbalances. This has enhanced the overall resilience of the euro area against possible economic and financial shocks. Thanks to significant fiscal consolidation efforts, fiscal deficits across euro area countries have been reduced (Figure 7). The European Commission expects deficits below 3% of GDP and positive primary surpluses in almost all euro area countries in 2018.      Figure 7  The increased robustness of the euro area economy is also reflected in the gradual unwinding of the large current account deficits accumulated by several countries before the crisis. Practically all those countries are now showing a surplus and the adjustment was mostly of a structural nature (see the blue bars, Figure 8, LHS). This turnaround was achieved because the initial dramatic increases in the real exchange rates have largely been corrected (see Figure 8, RHS). In most former programme countries relative unit labour costs are now below their respective level in 1999. All these positive adjustments have certainly contributed to underpin the evolution of sovereign bonds.      Figure 8  Likewise, corporate bond yields have continued to decline in the euro area (Figure 9 LHS, Figure 10 LHS for high yielders). Spreads for the debt of both euro area banks and non-financial firms relative to risk-free benchmarks have decreased significantly since the beginning of the year. Similarly to the U.S., this has reflected exceptionally low bond term premia (Figure 9, RHS). Compressed or even negative term premia may however point to potential significant corrections if events trigger a change in investors’ assessment of risk. Particularly, a revision concerning future inflation, no matter how unlikely, could lead to significant increases in term premia and higher yields.      Figure 9  Nevertheless, taking into account the present market configuration and modelling fair value valuations, excess corporate bond premia in the euro area cannot be detected (Figure 10, RHS). The excess bond premium is given by the deviation of the corporate credit spreads relative to the measured default risk of the issuer and the duration risk of the bond. The estimates show that ‘excess premia’ have declined since end-2015 and are currently negative, implying that investors require no premium to hedge against adverse economic scenarios.      Figure 10  Looking now to another asset class, our analysis indicates that on the aggregate, residential property prices are broadly in line with the fundamentals, using various different methods to assess whether there are overvaluations in the market (see Figure 11). The situation is different in the case of commercial real estate. In specific areas and large cities, housing prices have however increased at a faster pace than households’ incomes and may show signs of overvaluation.      Figure 11  On the other hand, property prices and transaction volumes have grown strongly in recent years and have already reached historical highs in many euro area countries (see Figure 12). Nominal growth of residential property prices accelerated to around 4% y-o-y in Q1 2017 but remained below its historical average growth rate and well below pre-crisis values. In real terms, price increases moderated due to inflation picking up. Residential property prices are demand-driven and increasingly supported by the recovery in personal income which is expected to continue.     Figure 12  Potential impact of asset price shocks The analysis of the situation in different asset markets illustrates that generalised overvaluation does not exist in the euro area. Tensions in some real estate markets are being dealt with by macroprudential instruments in many countries.  To assess possible financial stability risks we should however try to gauge the possible impact of the materialisation of an interest rate or yields correction. In the following paragraphs, I will explore the effects of such a shock calibrated at 100 basis points. Estimates suggest that the impact of this sizable increase on the non-financial private sector is relatively small, in particular for euro area households (see Figure 13, LHS). One reason lies in the interest rate fixation period of loans. Loans with floating rates or rates with rather short fixation periods are more widespread for euro area non-financial corporations. In contrast, the majority of newly demanded loans by households have longer interest rate fixation periods, making them more resilient against interest rate increases (see Figure 13, RHS). The estimates indicate that three years after the interest rate shock, the impact would represent a burden of 0.5% of household disposable income and about 2.5% of the gross revenues of non-financial firms, amounts that could be absorbed in the context of the ongoing recovery.      Figure 13   A sudden repricing in fixed income markets could lead to substantial capital losses for investors with large holdings of bonds. In the euro area, the impact would be felt in particular by the non-bank financial sector. For insurers and pension funds, bonds account for almost 40% of their portfolios. For banks, this share is only around 15% (see Figure 14 RHS). In addition, bond portfolio valuations have become more sensitive to changes in interest rates in recent years as duration has continued to increase (see Figure 14, LHS). Currently, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would lower the value of outstanding securities by 7%, compared to 5% before the financial crisis. However, these simple metrics neither take into account any hedging arrangements nor the impact of any repricing on the value and cost of financial institutions’ liabilities.     Figure 14  Regarding the overall impact on the significant euro area banks that are directly supervised by the ECB, Figure 15 updates estimates published in the ECB Financial Stability Review in May 2017. The estimates embody a whole range of effects: the capital losses on securities holdings (without considering any hedging), the increase in credit risk resulting from the estimated impact on probabilities of default of exposures, the corresponding effects on interest revenues and the broad impact on net interest income stemming from the increase in credit rates and funding costs of banks (deposits and wholesale funding).  The estimates are made for two scenarios. The global repricing scenario features, among other assumptions, an international increase in bond yields of 120 basis points and a 30% drop in stock prices. The European repricing scenario, induced purely by European developments, includes an average increase in bond yields of 75 basis points unevenly distributed across countries (no increase for Germany and more than 200 for some more vulnerable countries), accompanied by an average drop of 10% in equities. The outcome of the two scenarios indicates a negative impact on banks’ Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital hovering around 200 basis points in terms of deviation from the baseline scenario. This impact has to be considered against the comfortable present average CET1 ratio of 14% enjoyed by the euro area banks.      Figure 15  It is also important to recall that market sentiment towards euro area banks has continued to improve, despite some gyrations that broadly reflect developments in interest rate expectations (Figure 16, LHS). While contagion from the recent events of bank resolution and liquidation remained contained, these events have also highlighted the important challenges regarding the resolvability of weak banks. Notwithstanding some recent progress in non-performing loan (NPL) disposals, the large stock of NPLs remains a key structural concern in several countries. In addition, overcapacity and cost inefficiencies continue to weigh on bank profitability in certain banking markets.  The economic recovery, the expected steepening of the yield curve and even the progress being made in reducing the NPL level from the average peak of 8% in 2013 to the more recent average of 5.5%, have improved the market assessment of future banks’ profitability. Analysts’ earnings forecasts for 2017 and 2018 have been revised upwards since the U.S. elections, even if net interest income expectations have changed only marginally, despite improving economic conditions (volume effect) and (prospective) higher long-term interest rates (price effect). Analysts revised their earnings forecasts between October 2016 and January 2016 (see Figure 16 black dot in left bar) and between August 2017 and November 2016 (black dot in right bar) with the respective contributing factors. While forecasted net interest income was a drag on net income in the first period it contributed positively in the second period. Forecasted loan loss provisions contributed positively in the second period because they became less negative over the period November 2016 – August 2017 while forecasted operating expenses increased.      Figure 16  Macroprudential policy Let me now turn to the role of macroprudential policy in this risk environment.  The objective of macroprudential policy is to prevent and mitigate systemic risk by strengthening the resilience of the financial system and by smoothening the financial cycle.      Figure 17  Since November 2014, when the ECB was granted macroprudential responsibilities and competence to top-up the measures taken by national authorities, more than 100 decisions on macroprudential measures have been taken (see Figure 17). As regards capital buffers to counter the “too-big-to-fail” problem, the decisions relate to eight globally important banks (in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain) and overall, 109 domestic systemically important financial institutions in all euro area countries.  Decisions also led to calibrations of the systemic risk buffer in four countries (Austria, Estonia, the Netherlands and Slovakia) and to the activation and the future increase of the countercyclical capital buffer to 1.25% in 2018 in Slovakia.[5]      Figure 18  In addition, to address real estate risks, authorities raised risk weights for real estate exposure[6] and decided the use of Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Debt-To-Income (DTI) type of measures. Indeed, overall nine countries[7] have currently activated these borrower-type measures based on their national legislation (see Figure 18).  These measures influence the provision of credit and raise resilience by curtailing the tails of risk exposure. Given their effectiveness in curbing excessive credit flows, in December last year the ECB Governing Council called upon governments to implement the legislative basis for borrower-based measures in all euro area countries. In addition, the ongoing review of the macroprudential framework in the EU provides an excellent opportunity to make these tools available to macroprudential authorities on a common legal basis. The review also needs to promote a clear allocation of tools between the macro- and micro-prudential supervisors to ensure a timely activation of the instruments. This implies that the macroprudential use of Pillar 2 should be abandoned and the procedures for Article 458 CRR should be strongly streamlined for an effective use of macroprudential policy.[8]  The capital- and borrower-based macroprudential instruments I just mentioned are targeting risks among the banking sector and the real economy. But given the structure of our financial system, they are not sufficient. In fact, a growing fraction of credit intermediation is conducted by non-bank financial institutions. Their risks are essentially related to maturity mismatch or leverage. However, the current European macroprudential toolkit grants regulatory authorities limited possibilities to act on these risks in the non-banking sector. Europe should thus expand the toolkit to cover these risk areas.  As regards liquidity mismatches, this year’s policy recommendations by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities[9] have been an important step in the right direction. The recommendations permit authorities to indicate adequate liquidity risk management tools in extraordinary circumstances to open-ended funds. This also includes the suspension of redemptions in times of stress.  The FSB policy recommendations also address issues of measurement and monitoring of leverage within investment funds, including data collection for calculating synthetic leverage. Both recommendations are important because of the links between leverage and liquidity risk. For instance, recent research based on European alternative investment funds has shown that leveraged funds experience greater investor outflows after bad performance than unleveraged funds.[10] By limiting leverage we would be able to reduce these propagation mechanisms in times of stress. On the other hand, I see the application of further regulation to Securities Finance Transactions (SFT) as most pressing for macroprudential policy beyond banking. Authorities should be able to make macroprudential use of margins and haircuts in securities markets to control the build-up of excessive leverage.[11] Importantly, these tools reach beyond the banking system and can thereby address risks in the rapidly growing parts of the financial system. To safeguard financial stability in the euro area in the future, it is therefore essential that macroprudential authorities, particularly central banks, are provided by European legislators with an expanded toolkit. Let me conclude.  Financial stability in the euro area has improved, accompanying the ongoing economic recovery. Compared to last year, the euro area financial system is more resilient today. Bank profitability has recovered somewhat and steps have been taken to address some of the structural challenges faced by the banking system, although clearly a lot more needs to be done. Monetary policy, even when recalibrated, will continue to keep a very accommodative stance in order to attain the price stability objective in a self-sustained way. This implies that, in the present configuration of risks, Europe and all other advanced economies will have to take macroprudential policy much more seriously or they will face the risk of other financial crises that monetary policy cannot prevent.

Following the financial crisis of 2008, almost no stone was left unturned – at least in the field of banking regulation.  But this wave of re-regulation didn’t just focus on banks; rules were put in place to increase consumer protection and regulate the derivatives business, central counterparties and rating agencies. In many countries these changes were accompanied by institutional changes – new authorities were set up to deal with financial risks, and they were given new powers and instruments to mitigate these risks. Authorities gained a whole new set of tools for macroprudential oversight. The reforms were far-reaching in many countries, and in particular in the major financial centres. And I am convinced that this overhaul will contribute to future financial stability. There are two main reasons for this. First, deregulation and light-touch supervision were a significant cause of the financial crisis in 2008.  In the early 2000s many believed in the self-regulation of the financial market – so restricting the entrepreneurial freedom of financial market participants was not at the top of governments’ to-do lists. This all changed with the financial crisis, which was costly for banks, their investors and the taxpayers in many countries. In addition, the crisis was followed by an economic recession.  Banks, for example, now have to comply with a strict set of rules – they have to hold more and better capital than they did ten years ago. Their capacity to absorb losses has increased significantly. Banks are better prepared for a potential drying-up of liquidity sources, as the quantitative and qualitative requirements regarding liquidity management have risen significantly.  This makes banks more resilient to potential economic downturns or major unexpected events.  And supervision has changed quite dramatically, too. Many supervisors have been given greater powers to act pre-emptively; the set of supervisory tools and resources has expanded considerably. Supervisors are therefore able to pick up on deficiencies in banks, risky trends and misbehaviour earlier and more decisively than before the crisis.  Does this mean that there is no room to improve the current rules?  Definitely not.  There may be some topics which we have not yet addressed or which might need addressing because changes in the regulatory environment are always met with evasive manoeuvres.  One example is the shadow banking sector. When regulation is tightened in one area, incentives are put in place for other intermediaries to step in.  When certain business activities are pushed out of the banking sector, it does not necessarily mean that the risks for financial stability increase, but nor does it mean that these activities will not pose risks if they are handled by other market participants. So developments in the shadow banking sector warrant our close attention. Furthermore, we have to regularly assess whether the stated objectives have been fulfilled with the new set of rules. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is currently evaluating the recent reforms, so this will give us an indication as to whether there have been any unintended consequences and whether we need to adapt some of the rules – although I do not expect a need for huge amendments. As I mentioned, there is a second reason why I think that the reforms have made financial markets safer. The standards were set at the global level, by the FSB and the global standard-setting bodies. This addressed one of the lessons learnt from the last crisis – financial markets and financial institutions are much more closely interconnected than most people realised.  There is no such thing as a national banking sector. The banking sector has become global. Many banks operate not just in one country, but in dozens of countries. And almost all banks do at least some business with banks from outside their own country. Such a global banking sector is a good thing. It facilitates global trade and investment; it unlocks new sources of funding for the economy; and it improves the way capital and risks are allocated across countries. And because the banking sector is global, the standards need to be global too, to contribute to financial stability in the major financial centres. So I hope that the latest package of global banking standards – Basel III – will be completed this year. And I am still confident that this will be the case. After finalising Basel III, we need to focus on implementing the standards. I worry that some financial centres might not implement significant parts of the agreed framework.  And that would be a great mistake. Without consistent implementation, the common standards will remain fragmented, leaving the door wide open to a race to the bottom in regulation, regulatory arbitrage, higher risks and future crises. At the same time, banks would not compete on a level playing field, and that would weigh on efficiency. Ladies and gentlemen, the reforms that followed the financial crisis of 2008 were far-reaching, and they placed a burden on the financial sector – of that there is no doubt.  Do the reforms offer a full insurance contract to prevent each and every risk to financial stability? Well, no; such rules do not exist.  But there is no doubt that they help to make the global financial sector a safer place. They make it less likely that we will experience a second financial crisis of the same magnitude. Looking ahead, we should not forget that we live in a globalised world. And any attempt to turn back time, any attempt to isolate one country from the rest of the world is not only a pipe dream; it is a perilous dream.  That is particularly true in the case of finance and banking. So, instead of building walls, we should come together to discuss how we can deal with a global banking sector, how we can reap the benefits and keep the risks in check. That is the only way forward. Walking backwards will only lead us to where we came from: another global financial crisis. Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",

In my remarks today, I would like to reflect on the euro area’s recent economic developments and prospects. In doing so, I will outline the role monetary policy has played - and will continue to play - in supporting the recovery, while also touching upon some of the additional policies required to firmly secure a self-sustained recovery. The main message I would like to convey is that the euro area economy is experiencing a broad-based, robust and resilient recovery, which is underpinned by the monetary policy measures introduced by the ECB since June 2014. Despite this favourable growth dynamics, inflation developments have been subdued. We remain confident that the continued closing of the output gap will lead inflation to return to our medium-term objective, yet this return remains conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation. Looking beyond monetary policy, considerable reforms have been implemented and institutional progress has been achieved since the crisis, but supply-side policies are still required at the national level to boost potential growth, while at the euro area level, further institutional reforms are needed to enhance the functioning of EMU. Recent economic developments and prospects In the second quarter of 2017, euro area real GDP expanded for the 17th consecutive quarter, growing by 2.3% year-on-year and exceeding our expectations from earlier in the year. Growth is also becoming more broad-based across euro area countries, showing the lowest dispersion since the beginning of the monetary union. The flow of survey data in the third quarter has been encouraging and bodes well for continued growth momentum in the period ahead.  Robust economic activity is also being translated into a substantial amount of job creation. Almost 7 million more people are now employed in the euro area than in mid-2013, which implies that all of the employment losses recorded during the crisis have been offset. The improving labour market combined with increasing household wealth, strong consumer confidence and favourable financing conditions should all support continued robust private consumption. Investment prospects also look promising, which reflects both the need to make up for forgone investment in previous years as well as the highly accommodative financing conditions which have been passed through to lower borrowing costs for euro area firms. The resilience of the recovery reflects the strength of domestic demand which in turn, is being supported by the very favourable financing conditions stemming from the monetary policy measures introduced since June 2014 (see Chart 1).  Chart 1: Impact of ECB measures on key financing conditions        (contributions in basis points and percent)   Source: Bloomberg, ECB, ECB calculations.[1]   ECB staff counterfactual simulations indicate that absent our measures, GDP-weighted euro area 10-year government bond yields would, at present, be about 154 basis points higher and lending rates to NFCs about 68 basis points higher. ECB staff estimates indicate that our measures are contributing to an increase in euro area GDP of around 1.7%, cumulatively over the period 2016-2019 (see Chart 2) – well above monetary policy’s contribution to the two previous euro area recoveries in 2003Q2-2006Q4 and 2009Q3-2011Q3.  Chart 2a: Real GDP growth: actual, baseline projection and counterfactual without policy contribution        (year on year percentage change)   Chart 2b: HICP inflation: actual, baseline projection and counterfactual without policy contribution      (year on year percentage change)   Sources: ECB computations, SAPI Task Force, September 2017 MPE, BMEs. [2]  Looking ahead, the latest ECB staff projections continue to expect domestic demand to remain the key driver of euro area growth. Annual real GDP is projected to increase by 2.2% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. The risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced. According to the latest IMF WEO projections, euro area real GDP is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2017 before moderating to 1.9% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019, which is in line with the ECB projections.  Table 1: Comparison of forecasts for euro area real GDP growth      (annual percentage changes)  There are reasons to believe that the strengthening of economic activity, which so far has been significantly supported by accommodative monetary policy, will progressively be supported by more structural factors. Euro area governments have undertaken substantial policy actions and reforms to redress pre-crisis related macroeconomic imbalances and increase economic resilience.[3] For instance, euro area countries which had previously experienced large current account deficits are now in surplus. Moreover, both ECB staff and IMF estimates indicate that the largest driver of this adjustment is non-cyclical in nature, which implies a higher likelihood of sustainability as the recovery continues. Additionally, business cycle synchronisation across euro area countries has increased in recent years.[4] Finally, most countries that had large budget deficits have now positive primary surpluses. In sum, the euro area is now in a better state to withstand future economic or financial shocks. Despite robust growth dynamics, inflation developments have been subdued. Euro area headline inflation stood at 1.5% in September 2017, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate and is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year owing to energy-related base-effects. Measures of underlying inflation have not yet showed convincing signs of a sustained upward trend (see Chart 3).  Chart 3: Measures of underlying inflation      (annual percentage changes)  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations[5]. Looking further ahead and according to the latest ECB staff projections, inflation is expected to rise to 1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. There are uncertainties clouding the medium-term outlook for price stability, most notably the recent exchange rate volatility, which requires monitoring with regard to possible implications for inflation dynamics. The inflation outlook from the recent IMF WEO depicts inflation at 1.5% in 2017 and 1.4% in 2018, which is broadly in line with ECB projections. The apparent disconnect between strong economic activity, on the one hand, and low inflation and wages on the other, is one of the stand-out characteristics of the ongoing recovery.[6] From a policymaker’s perspective, a predictable relationship between slack and inflation represents a key monetary policy transmission mechanism through which central banks exert their effect on inflation dynamics. While there is no agreed upon approach to estimating a Phillips curve linking inflation to slack, on the whole empirical estimates indicate that the slope is currently flatter than in the period preceding the crisis, with several explanations as to why this might be the case. One reason relates to the choice of slack measurement, as the crisis may have led to structural changes in the labour market. For example, when a broader measurement of unemployment is used (Unemployment 6, currently just below 18%) as opposed to the narrower definition (Unemployment 3, standing at 9.1%), the slope of the euro area Phillips curve appears to have become steeper in recent years. Other reasons proposed include: external factors including globalisation, the enhanced role of adaptive expectations in influencing wage and price decisions, anchored by central bank targets, and finally, non-linearities and time-varying behaviour of different Phillips curve coefficients. [7]  Overall, a steepening Phillips curve provides confidence that the continued closing of the output gap will gradually lead inflation to return to our medium-term objective. Yet, this return remains conditional on a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation.  It is against this background that the Governing Council will decide over the autumn period on a re-calibration of its instruments, with a view to safeguarding the monetary policy impulse that is still necessary to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, in a way that is consistent with our monetary policy aim. Other policies Notwithstanding the strength of the ongoing recovery, supply-side policies as well as institutional reforms are required in order to firmly secure a self-sustainable recovery and a better functioning euro area. Country level policies should be aimed at increasing productivity and facilitating innovation and business investment. Turning to Europe and European reforms, the most relevant ones concern the completion of Banking Union, meaningful progress in the Capital Markets Union and the creation of an additional budgetary stabilisation function for the euro area. Both the Five Presidents Report on “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union” (2015) and the recent EU Commission paper on the “Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union” (2017), provide sufficient guidance on the way to proceed towards a stronger monetary union.

The quantification of the impact of the December 2015 policy package on asset prices rests on a broad-based assessment comprising event studies and model-based counterfactual exercises. The impact of the March 2016 measures and the impact of the December 2016 measures are assessed via model-based counterfactual exercises.

      "['2017-10-14', 'Sabine Lautenschläger', 'Is small beautiful? Supervision, regulation and the size of banks', 'Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an IMF seminar, Washington D.C., 14 October 2017', '  Is small beautiful? Supervision, regulation and the size of banks   Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an IMF seminar, Washington D.C., 14 October 2017 The call for greater proportionality in banking regulation and supervision is growing louder – not just in the United States and Europe, but also globally.  To put it bluntly, proportionality involves applying a different set of rules to banks operating in the same market. Careful consideration must therefore be given to the various objectives pursued, and the costs and benefits involved.  On the one hand, this means that we need to assess the financial stability risks posed by individual banks and groups of banks. And we need to look at the implications of proportionality for local competition. On the other hand, we have to consider the costs of regulation and supervision. Small banks face greater difficulties in complying with complex regulation. This may put them at a disadvantage and therefore reduce diversity in the banking sector. However, a wide diversity of small and medium-sized banks makes the banking sector more stable. Thus proportionality may be necessary to foster such diversity.  These are the kind of trade-offs we need to talk about.  But let me begin by talking about risks, as this is the starting point for regulation and supervision.  It can generally be assumed that the failure of a small bank poses a smaller risk to the financial system than the failure of a big bank. So it might make sense to apply a different regulatory and supervisory regime to small individual banks.  However, when many small banks with the same business model form mutual liability arrangements via institutional protection schemes, qualified holdings or integrated cooperative structures, they might become systemically relevant – at least at national level.  In the event of a failure, all these small banks taken together could pose a big risk to the financial system. This is known as the “too many to fail” problem. It deserves particular attention – and probably a response that goes beyond the standard microprudential supervision that we are here to talk about today.  As small banks are generally less risky, the costs and benefits of regulation and supervision may not be balanced for small banks in some areas. Applying to small banks the same approach that is applied to large banks would not be proportionate, as the costs, in particular of complex prudential rules, would be higher in comparison and the benefits would be smaller.  So there is a strong case for proportionality. Looking at the European situation, the EU’s single rulebook already provides for such proportionality in many cases. For instance, reporting requirements for small banks are far less stringent than those for large banks: small banks have to report about 600 data points to supervisors, whereas larger banks have to report more than 40,000.  The question is whether more proportionality in banking regulation is needed? Indeed, the discussion in Europe is currently focusing on changes in several additional areas which will enable banks to apply simpler rules and thus reduce compliance costs for smaller banks:  One proposal focuses on the capital requirement rules for market and counterparty credit risk. Banks with small trading books below €50 million could be exempted from the obligation to have a prudential trading book. This would enable them to use the simpler credit risk framework. Banks with trading books below €300 million could use a simpler standardised approach to calculate market risk. Similarly, in the field of counterparty credit risk, banks with small derivative portfolios might be able to use a simpler standardised approach to calculate capital requirements. Another proposal looks at reducing the regulatory burden of small banks by softening reporting requirements. Some of the proposals discussed involve reducing the number of data points to be reported by using simplified templates and less granular data. Less convincing are proposals which involve less frequent reporting. This would not result in cost savings, as banks would still have to invest in setting up reporting structures. But it would mean that supervisors would have to work with outdated information. There are also suggestions to reduce the disclosure obligations for small banks, in particular non-listed ones. This would significantly reduce their administrative burden. And there are proposals to exempt smaller banks from some remuneration rules – something that is worth discussing.  A great many proposals have been put forward altogether – I will refrain from listing them all.  The critical question is: what do we want to achieve through the proportional regulation and supervision of small banks? Would it mean that these banks could hold less capital, less liquidity? In my opinion, proportionality means simpler rules for smaller banks. But it does not mean that the rules should be generally less stringent, or that banks can hold less capital or liquidity. Finally, a crucial issue is where to draw the line between small and large banks.  Depending on the objectives of proportionality, the line might be drawn according to the volume of total assets; or it could be linked to the size of specific business activities. It might also depend on banks’ business models or on whether or not banks use internal models. And the size of a bank relative to the country’s total banking assets could also play a role.  Both quantitative and qualitative criteria need to be assessed when considering where to draw the line between small and large banks.  To sum up, small banks are generally less risky than larger ones. So a proportionate approach to regulating and supervising small banks is indeed appropriate.  An approach that resulted in simpler rules for small banks could help to balance the costs and benefits involved – but it should not result in small banks holding far less capital, as they also need to remain resilient during an economic downturn in order to continuously provide credit to the economy.

But what I can say is that the banks are in a better position than they were. They are better capitalised and have improved their liquidity situation and their governance. They are making slow but steady progress in tackling all the well-known challenges and adapting their business models. Still, supervisors are paid to demand more. So we want quite a few banks to adapt more quickly to the new environment.  Digital technology is rapidly gaining traction in the banking world. It brings new opportunities but also new competitors for each and every bank. And we are seeing more and more banks incorporating a digital dimension into their strategies. However, they are doing so at varying speeds and we are not always satisfied with their progress. All banks need to focus on transforming their services more quickly. Interest rates are still low, weighing on the profits of many banks. This situation makes it imperative for them to adjust their business models. Some banks still need to diversify their sources of income, manage their costs more diligently and become more efficient. Legacy assets, such as non-performing loans, are still high in some parts of the banking sector in Europe. They depress banks’ profits and curb their ability to finance the economy. The good news is that we are seeing some progress here. The proportion of non-performing loans in the euro area fell from more than 7% in the second quarter of 2015 to below 6% at the beginning of 2017. Still, I think the banks need to be more ambitious. We are not satisfied with the strategy of each and every bank. Some need to act more decisively – and we will push them to do so. And finally, Brexit is on the horizon, and will have a major impact on the banking sector. Most of all, it will affect those banks which access the European market from the United Kingdom and vice versa. They have to prepare themselves for other forms of market access – and quickly.  All this is happening at a time when the banking sectors of some countries still need to consolidate. Let’s turn to Europe’s banking union. It now rests on two pillars: alongside banking supervision, there is a mechanism that allows us to resolve banks without disrupting the financial system. Banks can fail, and they will fail. That became clear earlier this year when the new system passed its first test. What is still missing, though, is the third pillar of the banking union: a joint deposit insurance scheme. But the first two pillars alone ensure that the most critical aspects are covered. Banks, their owners and their creditors not only have to comply with stricter rules and more intrusive supervision; they are also subject to greater market discipline as it has become clear that they can be allowed to fail. It is up to each bank to endeavour not only to survive but also to prosper in these circumstances. And the good news is that it is possible to do so. Our analyses have revealed that there are a number of banks which consistently outperform their peers. So there is progress and hope, but only for those who understand this new world, accept it, and act accordingly. Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",

The economy has now expanded for 17 consecutive quarters, and at a faster than expected pace in the first half of this year. Over this period, employment in the euro area has increased by almost seven million. Youth unemployment has declined from its peak above 24% in 2013 to just above 19% recently, but still remains above its pre-crisis level, and especially high in some member countries. The ongoing recovery is being largely driven by domestic forces, with both consumption and investment contributing to growth. Private consumption is fostered by employment gains and increasing household wealth. Investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Also, the broad-based global recovery is increasingly supporting euro area exports. The latest ECB staff projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.2% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. Risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced, with downside risks stemming predominantly from external sources. In this context, preserving openness underpinned by multilateral cooperation and effective financial regulation will decisively contribute to fostering a favourable external environment. While headline inflation has increased markedly over the past year, this is largely reflecting energy and food inflation. Measures of underlying inflation however have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend, despite an uptick in recent months. Domestic cost pressures remain subdued, with wage growth still low by historical standards. At the same time, the deflation risk in the euro area has essentially disappeared. Because of anticipated base effects in energy prices, headline inflation is likely to temporarily decline towards the end of the year. The latest ECB staff projections point to annual euro area headline inflation of 1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. Risks to this inflation outlook are broadly balanced. Exchange rate volatility represents one source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability in the euro area.  Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack in the euro area economy. However, progress towards a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation towards our objective is not yet sufficiently convincing.  Thus, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed to secure a sustained return of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term – in line with the ECB’s mandate. As affirmed by the Governing Council at its last monetary policy meeting on 7 September, we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Our asset purchase programme (APP), at the current monthly pace of €60 billion, is intended to run until the end of December this year, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. Later this year we will decide on the calibration of our policy instruments beyond the end of 2017, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards our objective.  The ECB’s monetary policy measures and the favourable effects they are having on borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing and credit flows across the euro area are supporting domestic demand and are also facilitating the deleveraging process. In order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy measures, actions in other economic policy areas remain necessary to strengthen long-term growth and resilience in the euro area.  Meanwhile, the condition and resilience of the euro area banking sector has continued to improve. Euro area banks’ CET1 capital ratios remain at a solid level of about 14%, whereas profitability has stabilised on the back of the strengthening recovery. Some weak banks have been successfully resolved with the impact on the rest of the euro area banking sector being well contained. Notwithstanding these positive developments, important challenges remain, including the still subdued profitability, structural challenges in some parts of the euro area banking sector, such as the presence of excess capacity and cost inefficiencies, as well as – in a few countries – the persistently high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs). On aggregate, however, further progress has been made with respect to resolving NPLs, and a comprehensive action plan to deal with legacy asset quality issues was adopted by the Council of the European Union and is now being followed up by EU and national authorities. The ECB has published guidance to banks on NPLs and a draft addendum, currently subject to public consultation.  With respect to financial stability, we observe that at the current stage the euro area’s position in the financial cycle is consistent with the ongoing economic recovery. There are no indications of widespread asset price misalignments and credit developments remain modest. Nevertheless, relatively buoyant real estate dynamics and high household debt levels in some countries warrant careful monitoring. We expect the national macroprudential authorities in the euro area to remain vigilant and ready to use the macroprudential policy instruments at their disposal to counteract the any emerging risks when necessary. Within its macroprudential mandate, the ECB will contribute to this end. Despite the potential for monetary policy to influence economic growth in the short term, strong, sustainable and balanced growth requires other policymakers to assume their responsibilities. From a global perspective, one of the key ingredients for raising potential growth and productivity is openness. Open trade, investment and sustainable financial flows play a key role in the cross-border diffusion of new technologies that drive forward efficiency improvements. Preserving openness is thus key to strengthening global growth potential. It should be underpinned by effective multilateral cooperation, including in the field of financial regulation and supervision. As regards the euro area, strengthening its long-term growth potential calls for decisive action to address the remaining structural issues. Reform implementation needs to be substantially stepped up, with further actions to improve the business and regulatory environment aimed at boosting investment and increasing productivity. Labour market rigidities need to be reduced further to enhance job creation and reduce unemployment, especially for young people. To foster reform implementation at country level, a full and consistent application of the EU’s policy framework is required, including the European Semester and the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. Likewise, full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact remains crucial to ensure confidence in the EU’s fiscal framework and to safeguard public debt sustainability. In the current environment, a broadly neutral euro area fiscal stance strikes an appropriate balance between aggregate stabilisation and sustainability needs. Although such a euro area stance is prevailing, the contribution of individual Member States to the aggregate outcome is suboptimal. Some of them need to take additional measures to ensure compliance with the fiscal rules, while others have scope to use available fiscal space. In addition, all euro area countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies by prioritising public investment and reducing the tax burden on labour. The current political and economic momentum in Europe also provides an opportunity to strengthen our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Further integration needs to be achieved above all by implementing what has been agreed and by completing the common projects we have started. This includes completing the banking union and building a capital markets union. A more complete EMU, with further steps towards a deeper financial, fiscal and economic union, will be the foundation for a stable, flourishing and resilient euro area economy. That is the best contribution which Europe can make to global economic growth and financial stability. By delivering on its mandate, the ECB will continue to play its part in this endeavour.  ']\n",

Arguably, never before in history have banks faced as many significant challenges as they do today. Exceptionally low interest rates and more rigorous post-crisis regulation are weighing on banks’ earnings and limiting, at times, their ability to make full use of their balance sheets. Technological change too is threatening incumbents in many ways. Although technological progress has often probed the adaptability and flexibility of financial intermediaries in the past, the speed and scope of current innovations has the potential to change more radically the way financial services are provided to households and firms.  These circumstances naturally also create challenges for regulators, central banks and other policymakers. Ten years after the start of the crisis, it is time to take stock of the impact of the wealth of rules and regulations that have been adopted since then. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has initiated important work in this direction and is expected to conduct a thorough evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms. The paper presented by Andy Haldane and co-authors at this conference is a powerful guide to these evaluations.[1] They conclude, correctly in my view, that the loudly voiced concerns about higher capital requirements leading to lower lending do not seem to have materialised, giving some credit to the claims that capital requirements could have been calibrated at a higher level, even though the combined impact of the total loss absorption capacity and capital requirements remains to be fully understood.[2] Moreover, Haldane and colleagues emphasise the complementary nature of the existing rules and provide empirical evidence in defence of the current “multipolar” (that is, silo-based) regulatory regime. Their work further strengthens the case for any review of the new regulatory framework to err on the side of conservatism, and to withstand pressure from vested interest groups. In my remarks today I cannot pay justice to all dimensions of Andy’s paper but I plan to do two things. First, I will expand on one of the paper’s key aspects, namely the potential trade-offs involved in multipolar regulation. And, second, I will touch on one issue that has arguably received less attention so far – the effects of financial regulation on financial structures, in particular at times of fast technological change.  Allow me to explain these two observations in more detail. A holistic view on regulatory trade-offs Over the past ten years, the financial market landscape has changed significantly, both in terms of how risk is being transformed and how it is being pooled and managed. On the intermediation side, the non-bank financial sector has substantially increased its share of the market, from 43% in 2008 to 55% in early 2017. On the risk management side, central clearing houses have emerged following the introduction of mandatory central clearing for standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives – as agreed by the G20 at its Pittsburgh summit in 2009.  These changes have also impacted the nature and scope of financial regulation. For example, the FSB has progressed towards tighter regulation of market-based finance, while CPMI-IOSCO and other international bodies have worked tirelessly since 2012 to establish a regulatory framework that makes central clearing counterparties (CCPs) more resilient and easier to resolve.[3]  A more diverse financial sector, however, also means that regulatory spillovers have become both more likely and more difficult to identify. Let me take the example of CCPs and their interactions with the Basel III leverage ratio. Because clearing services require clients to post collateral, the non-recognition of such collateral in the leverage ratio framework may cause banks to scale back their clearing services, potentially leading to an unhealthy concentration of clearing services. In other words, there is a risk that the leverage ratio could potentially make our markets more, not less, risky. Some have publicly concluded on this issue, asking the Basel Committee to consider how it could be amended. Others are still reviewing these dynamics, including an FSB-led review of incentives to centrally clear, the Derivatives Assessment Team (DAT).  So, different from regulation for one category of financial players, such as banks, where overlapping rules may be desirable for the reasons explained by Andy and colleagues (the “Tinbergen” and “Brainard” rules applied to financial regulation[4]), regulatory spillovers across financial players may be more a source of concern.  Ideally, quantitative models would support policymakers in characterising and overcoming such trade-offs. This approach, however, faces two high hurdles. The first is that policymakers would need to specify better their loss function, giving clear weights to different, and potentially conflicting, objectives. This is a highly delicate endeavour, however. And, second, even if we could spell out our objective function, the way our quantitative models depict the financial sector lacks the granularity needed to quantify trade-offs in a sufficiently precise manner. So, at the end, I generally agree with Andy’s conclusion that we will likely keep shooting in the dark, which means shooting many arrows at the same target. Ultimately, however, potential adverse spillovers cannot be an excuse to undo what has been achieved since 2009. But when adverse spillovers are obvious, such as in the case of the leverage ratio and central clearing, then we should not hesitate to correct them. This also relates to the undesired consequences of a lack of international cooperation in some pockets of the regulatory domain. Consider again CCP oversight and supervision. Some CCPs are clearly global in nature in view of the range of clearing members they serve or the markets and currencies they clear.  It would therefore be important for all jurisdictions to recognise the need for non-domestic supervisors and central banks to be involved in the oversight of such global CCPs, and in establishing cooperative oversight arrangements where relevant. A supervisory approach that recognises the legitimate interests of non-domestic authorities is vital for tackling the global repercussions of a potential CCP failure, including its recovery and resolution.  The European Commission proposal to amend the EMIR regulation is a case in point. After the UK’s decision to leave the EU, and with UK CCPs clearing approximately 90% of the euro-denominated interest rate swaps of euro area banks, there would be clear risks in allowing the current EU arrangements for the supervision of third country CCPs to continue as they are. The proposal provides EU supervisors and the relevant central banks of issue with the tools they need in order to monitor and address risks to the EU’s financial system.[5]  So more, not less, international cooperation is crucial to safeguard financial stability. This is a point worth emphasising, particularly at times where a push-back from internationally agreed standards is being discussed openly. In an integrated global economy, financial regulation has to rely on internationally agreed standards. Turning back the clock on international financial regulation would revive distrust, create financial fragmentation, and risk regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom.  Effects of financial regulation on financial structures Let me now turn to another challenge the regulatory community faces in my view, namely the impact – whether desired or not – of regulation on the financial structure of our economies.[6] There are two broad ways in which the regulatory framework is likely to affect the funding mix of firms and households. The first one works through some forms of financing receiving preferential treatment. The second works through protecting incumbents from new competitors. Both channels can be intended or unintended by regulators, and both can ultimately steer an economy towards adopting a financial structure that may look different to the one it would have adopted were market forces left to their own devices. Despite these allocative effects, regulation is rarely based on first principles. In fact, regulators are caught between a rock and a hard place. Ignoring the effects of regulation on our economies’ financial structures is likely to be naïve and delusional – we may not know the speed and scope of the impact, but we can be relatively certain that the effect will not be neutral. At the same time, internalising the effects would make it increasingly difficult to distinguish between prudential and industry objectives. This could create misplaced incentives and can run the risk of failing to fulfil the financial stability mandate. The good news is that academic research has long been suggesting that even if financial rules were to distort the first-best allocation, the impact on growth and society in general would likely be immaterial.[7] The assertion is that both bank and market-based finance tends to support economic development and living standards in similar ways.[8]  More recent research, however, challenges these findings. Evidence is growing that large banking systems are associated with more systemic risk and lower economic growth, in particular as countries grow richer.[9] Other research suggests that deeper equity markets are more effective in bringing economies closer to the technological frontier.[10]  On balance, therefore, empirical research is increasingly probing the role and importance of banks in developed economies, both in terms of their marginal contribution to growth and as shock absorbers. This is also reflected in the political discussion. The European push towards a capital markets union reflects not only the need for increased cross-border risk-sharing in a currency union, but also the understanding that a more balanced funding mix is better at helping to absorb economic shocks, much in line with Alan Greenspan’s “spare tyre” hypothesis.[11] There is also the hope that deeper and better integrated equity markets will support innovation and productivity growth in the European Union. In addition, we can see that banks are increasingly challenged by technological shifts. New competitors are emerging rapidly and threaten to conquer banks’ market shares in some of their core income-generating areas. Crowd funding or peer-to-peer lending, for example, has the potential to affect bank lending services. E-trading or robo-advisory, meanwhile, may crowd banks out of typical investment management or advisory functions. Other areas of competition involve the provision of payment services.  This, of course, does not mean that banks have become redundant or a drag on society. Banks play a key social role of pooling savings and engaging in maturity and risk transformation, and they should continue doing so. But it does raise two important questions: first, are we at a tipping point where the future of banks is challenged? And second, should regulators care? That is, should we protect banks from recent technological shifts and the emergence of new competitors? Should regulators have a preconceived idea of which financial structure is best for society, bearing in mind the trade-off I mentioned before? So far, the regulatory approach has generally been built on the assumption that opening up market access to new fintech companies will increase social surplus and spur innovation, similar to what we have seen in other network industries. At the same time, rules are still in place that protect incumbents. For example, fintech firms lack access to the customer transaction data they would need to provide a broader range of financial services – data that banks can use to cross-sell financial services at a price that might be higher than if information-sharing was less restricted.  As an example, the revision of Europe’s Payment Services Directive (PSD2), due to be implemented by EU Member States in January 2018, is designed to introduce more competition by requiring banks to share account information. With access to such data, fintech companies could increasingly shake up the banking sector.  In this regulatory landscape, I see two broad scenarios for the future. In the first one, incumbents rise to the challenge. They join forces with start-ups, embrace new technologies, cut costs and gain new sources of revenue. Some of these partnerships are happening as we speak. The outcome under this scenario is generally benign as, first, new technologies are likely to spread more rapidly through banks’ existing networks, fostering productivity and growth, and, second, as current prudential regulation is already geared towards banks, thereby preserving financial stability.  However, I can already see one challenge for regulators, which is to let banks reap the economies of scale inherent to digital technologies while not recreating risks of too-big-to-fail. This scenario also crucially assumes that banks are profitable enough to carry out the necessary investments, which in Europe involves reducing costs and addressing forcefully non-performing loans. In the second scenario banks remain more defensive or, as they would probably like to argue, stifled by regulation and the low interest rate environment. As a result, they increasingly risk failing to meet the changing demands of customers, who, in a digitalised world, expect financial services to be available in real time, anywhere and at any time. This scenario could be a real threat to incumbents, in particular if digital giants, who already have access to large amounts of customer data, were to start targeting parts of the banking value chain, which would limit banks’ ability to cross-sell and, ultimately, crowd banks out of a large swathe of financial services.  For society as a whole, would this scenario be worse? Firms and households could benefit from a growing number of financial products and services, lower prices and faster provision. The problem, however, would be that banking services would likely migrate towards the less-regulated parts of the financial system where many fintechs – as non-deposit takers – still operate.[12] This is what Charles Goodhart coined the “boundary problem”[13] of financial regulation. In this case, to avoid regulators once again being “bloodhounds in pursuit of greyhounds”[14], current regulatory loopholes would need to be closed to ensure that financial intermediation outside the banking sector remains safe and sound.  Here is where normative questions might arise, however. The reason is that financial regulation may affect the direction and rate of change at which financial structures evolve. On the one hand, pre-emptively drawing in the reins in the name of financial stability could stifle innovation and prevent fintechs from growing important economies of scale. So it could also put small businesses and households at a disadvantage as they would potentially benefit from faster technological progress, provided it remained safe. On the other hand, allowing risks to accumulate in the unregulated sector could lead to over-exuberance, recreate risks to financial stability, and forego the benefits of past regulatory efforts. Finding the right balance and identifying the risks in real time is an inherently difficult task, of course. I have no quick or easy solutions to offer. But what we should do, in my view, is to more systematically encourage more research on these important matters.  Central banks are not innocent bystanders in this process. We have to be mindful about the impact of our own decisions on the future of financial structures. Digital currencies, for example, could undermine commercial banks’ monopoly on creating inside money.[15] Negative interest rates, meanwhile, can have adverse consequences for banks’ profitability over time despite being extremely effective in complementing other non-conventional monetary policy instruments and helping central banks overcome the zero lower bound constraint. So far, the general equilibrium effects of negative rates have clearly dominated. More generally, it is hard to believe that central banks keeping very large balance sheets for a considerable amount of time will not have an impact on financial intermediation. Looking forward, low productivity and ageing societies may mean that our economies have gravitated towards a low growth, low interest rate environment that may weigh more permanently on banks’ profits and, hence, financial stability. Monetary policy, in turn, may have to resort more often to non-standard measures to meet its price stability mandate. In these circumstances, we need to be mindful of risks to financial stability. A too protracted period of asset purchases, for example, may cause financial imbalances to build up with potentially adverse consequences for price stability. Conclusion Let me close. Preserving financial stability has become a much more complex and intertwined endeavour than it was 10 or 20 years ago. These interconnections can profoundly change the balance of regulatory trade-offs across major financial market participants. What is more, the financial system is evolving quickly. Intra-temporal trade-offs are made worse by appreciable inter-temporal trade-offs, where policymakers need to keep a watchful eye on the allocative repercussions of their regulatory decisions.  In this environment, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions. But there are two principles on which we should continue to build. The first is cooperation among regulators, both within and across borders. Only by joining forces will we be able to break up remaining silos and identify common solutions to the challenging trade-offs we face. The second is cooperation across policymakers. Conferences like this one bring together policymakers from different fora – monetary policy, fiscal policy and financial stability. They force us to think beyond our usual boundaries and have the potential to raise awareness and sensitivities.  I would therefore like to thank Olivier Blanchard and the Peterson Institute for International Economics wholeheartedly.  Thank you for your attention.      [1] See Aikman, D., A.G. Haldane, M.

      "['2017-10-12', 'Peter Praet', 'Monetary policy and the euro area economic expansion', 'Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the JP Morgan Seminar entitled “Euro Zone: Will the European Recovery Continue?”, Washington D.C., 12 October 2017', '  Monetary policy and the euro area economic expansion   Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the JP Morgan Seminar entitled “Euro Zone: Will the European Recovery Continue?”, Washington D.C., 12 October 2017 The monetary policy measures introduced by the ECB since June 2014 have played a pivotal role in supporting the economy and have proven to be effective in preventing a period of disinflation from degenerating into one of outright deflation. More than three years on, the risks of deflation have largely disappeared and the transmission of our policy measures to the real economy is clearly evidenced by a broad-based cyclical recovery with solid momentum. This lays the groundwork for a return of inflation to below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The strong economic expansion should not lead to complacency, however. Strengthening euro area longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities requires decisive contributions from other policy areas. Implementing growth-enhancing structural reforms and strengthening the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union are essential to support the resilience of the euro area on a lasting basis. Before turning to price dynamics and monetary policy, let me say a bit more about the latest economic developments. Real GDP in the euro area has expanded for 17 consecutive quarters, growing by 2.3% year on year during the second quarter of 2017, according to Eurostat – a rate that surpassed our projection at the start of the year. This compares with the latest potential growth estimates for the euro area of just over 1%.[1] The latest survey data point to a strong third quarter. The composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index – which is highly correlated with growth in the euro area – is above its long-term average and remains close to six-year highs. The forward-looking components of the survey continue to point to growth in the quarters ahead. Moreover, Eurostat’s Economic Sentiment Indicator is near a ten-year high. A notable feature of the ongoing recovery is that it has led to tangible employment gains. Since hitting a trough in mid-2013, the number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7 million. As a result, all of the employment losses recorded during the crisis have been offset. The unemployment rate also continues to decline, despite an increase in labour force participation, and is now at its lowest level in eight years.  Employment growth, together with the gradual increase in employee compensation, supports households’ disposable income and is underpinning solid consumption dynamics. Buoyant sentiment, favourable bank lending conditions and the notable progress achieved with respect to deleveraging are all conducive to robust consumer spending. The investment outlook is also positive, supported not only by a need to modernise the capital stock after years of subdued investment and an improving outlook for profitability, but also by highly accommodative financing conditions as our policy measures have passed through financial markets to affect the borrowing conditions of businesses and their customers.  Since the announcement of our policy measures in June 2014, bank lending rates for euro area non-financial corporations have fallen by almost 120 basis points and those for households by 100 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by almost 190 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area. Heterogeneity of lending rates across countries has also fallen sharply. For example, the difference between the average lending rate for firms in countries that were severely affected by the crisis versus other countries has narrowed by around 100 basis points over this period. The pass-through of monetary policy has become more even.  These positive developments have been further supported by the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, as a result of which banks are passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers.[2]  The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, as recent surveys have shown.[3] Moreover, bank lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, covering the period from October 2016 to March 2017, euro area SMEs have continued to signal improvements in the availability of bank loans. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016. Against the backdrop of this substantial easing of financing conditions, domestic demand has become the mainstay of growth in the euro area, making the recovery more resilient to developments overseas. The latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections point to robust private consumption and a continued recovery in investment over the period ahead. Real GDP growth is projected to remain well above potential growth and to average between 1.7% and 2.2% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced: on the upside, the current cyclical momentum could result in stronger than expected growth, while the remaining downside risks relate primarily to global factors and developments in the exchange rate. From today’s point of view, the strength and resilience of the recovery tends to foster our confidence that reflationary forces will gradually support a return of headline inflation towards a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But inflation dynamics remain subdued. After hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last year and stood at 1.5% in September according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. Owing to energy-related base effects, headline inflation rates are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year. Looking further ahead, as reflected in the latest ECB staff projections, headline inflation is expected to remain notably below a level that is consistent with our inflation aim over the next two years, averaging 1.5% in 2019. Furthermore, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Some measures of underlying inflation – which is more closely related to domestic price pressures – have ticked up moderately in recent months. For example, HICP inflation excluding food and energy had been stuck below 1% for around three years, but was 1.1% in September. Nevertheless, underlying inflation pressures are still too weak and have so far failed to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.  An important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued is muted wage dynamics, which are shaped by many factors. In addition to weak productivity developments, the significant degree of remaining labour market slack is limiting wage growth. When assessing slack, it can prove useful to also look at broader measures than the unemployment rate. The so-called “U6 measure” captures unemployment, underemployment (meaning workers who would like to work more hours) and marginal attachment, namely those workers that are not competing very actively in the labour market, for example because they are not available to start a new job at short notice. This measure currently covers just below 18% of the labour force and is thus considerably higher than the unemployment rate.[4]  We are undoubtedly experiencing a solid, broad-based and resilient economic recovery that is contributing to a narrowing of the output and unemployment gaps. But there still appears to be a disconnect between growth and inflation. As slack in the economy continues to be absorbed, reflationary forces will gradually build up and the traditional Phillips curve connection between inflation and the business cycle should eventually reassert itself. That being said, current estimates of the slope of the Phillips curve appear to be flatter than in previous times, which could be interpreted as an indication that the relationship between economic slack and inflation has weakened. This could be due to either a mismeasurement of slack (because of structural changes in the labour market) or the relationship between slack and inflation not being stable over time. At the same time, this effect could also result from discrete parallel shifts in the Phillips curve. Such parallel shifts may occur because of temporary changes in wage and inflation mark-ups, or – more concerning from a central bank’s perspective – the incipient dislodging of inflation expectations. In an extreme scenario, the entrenchment of disinflationary developments could sustain a downward drift in the Phillips curve and unmoor inflation expectations. Empirically disentangling these factors is extremely difficult, so such considerations need to be borne in mind when discussing the relationship between economic slack and inflation developments, particularly in an environment of uncertainty over the anchoring of inflation expectations. It is our primary task, as a central bank, to ensure that the reconnection of the real and the nominal sides of the economy – what I referred to before as the Phillips curve regularity eventually reasserting itself – occurs at a steady state rate of inflation that is consistent with our medium-term aim: a level below, but close to, 2%.  We have not yet accomplished our mission, and so we must remain patient and persistent.  Patience is required for inflationary pressures to show through convincingly in the data. The euro area’s economic environment is improving, and the negative tail risks to inflation expectations, which were clearly visible at the start of our asset purchase programme, have virtually disappeared. But measured inflation rates are exceedingly volatile and metrics of underlying price pressures remain weak. The entire distribution of inflation expectations still needs to shift a fair distance to the right. We must also be persistent in using our policy instruments to ensure a durable and self-sustained return of inflation towards a level that is below, but close to, 2% over a meaningful medium-term horizon. Crucially, the baseline scenario for future inflation remains contingent on easy financing conditions, which, to a large extent, depend on the support of monetary policy. In the next few weeks, the Governing Council will assess how the evolving macroeconomic conditions, most notably the outlook for price stability, and the state of monetary policy transmission can be expected to influence the monetary policy stance. It will recalibrate its instruments accordingly, with a view to delivering the monetary policy impulse that remains necessary to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation in a manner that is consistent with our monetary policy aim.

Deflationary risks have disappeared and some measures of underlying inflation have ticked up over recent months. But overall inflation developments, despite the solid growth, have remained subdued.  Accordingly, while we remain confident that inflation developments will eventually return to levels below, but close to, 2%, our medium-term objective, the evidence still shows insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards those levels. Such “sustained adjustment” is the principal contingency that has guided and will be guiding the introduction and withdrawal of our asset purchase programme (APP) and, indirectly, of all the main components of our present policy.  In my remarks today, I would like to outline the central role monetary policy plays in underpinning this recovery and to discuss the main mechanisms by which our measures have impacted on the economy. I will start from a brief overview of the monetary policy toolkit that the Governing Council has adopted over the last years, and I will sketch out the elements that are most relevant for the Governing Council’s deliberations about the calibration of our policy measures. I will then highlight the key channels by which this toolkit transmits to financial conditions. Finally, I will focus on the impact channels of the APP, which plays a central role among the policy instruments.  The ECB’s monetary policy toolkit Over the last three years, the Governing Council has had to take bold measures to maintain price stability. The context in which we launched this package of measures, in June 2014, was one in which a sustained period of disinflation could have morphed into one of outright deflation. The Governing Council had to move beyond its conventional policy instruments and instead deploy a set of unconventional tools that were tailored to the specific challenges of that time. The first challenge related to the effective lower bound on interest rates. The leeway to cut policy-controlled short-term interest rates was insufficient to provide the degree of accommodation that was necessary to support the economy and fight off the threats to our objective. The second challenge related to a dysfunctional monetary transmission. Bank intermediation was significantly impaired, which had caused the transmission of policy stimulus to the broader economy to be too slow and uncertain. The unconventional tools were designed to act both on the quasi-risk-free yield curve and on bank lending margins. By “yield curve” I mean the term structure that we observe in the money market for overnight indexed interest rate swaps (OIS), as well as the curves in the markets for the national sovereign debts, which traditionally constitute an important benchmark for pricing credit to the entire economy. Due to this benchmark function, the level and shape of the yield curve are crucial determinants of prices of a whole range of longer-term financial assets, including those most closely tied to economic activity, such as bank lending rates, corporate bonds and mortgages. Our policy to influence intermediate and long-term yields has been instrumental in bringing the whole structure of credit conditions for households and companies to the accommodative levels necessary to arrest disinflation and strengthen the recovery.  By now, the OIS curve at maturities of ten years and above is more than half a percentage point below the levels observed before the initiation of our measures in June 2014 (Chart 1). For sovereign yields, the drop over this period was even more pronounced, amounting to around one percentage point for maturities at or above ten years. While financial market developments over this time period were also impacted by a host of other factors that go beyond ECB monetary policy, empirical analysis indeed ascribes the bulk of the decline in longer-term yields to our measures.[1] Moreover, it indicates that the monetary impulse has transmitted not only to money-market and sovereign yield curves, but also to an array of other market segments, including financial and non-financial corporate bonds, as well as equity markets (Chart 2).    As a complement to the impact of our measures on yield curves, our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (“TLTROs”) were specifically designed to compress bank lending rates – a key intermediate objective of the policy toolkit, given the important role that bank credit plays in financing the euro area economy. Through a number of mechanisms, the TLTROs have successfully bid down the level of bank lending rates on loans to households and companies, while preserving banks’ overall margins.[2]     For instance, the cost of borrowing for non-financial corporations, at the euro area average, are now more than one percentage point lower than before the first TLTROs were adopted in June 2014 (Chart 3). What is more, the introduction of the TLTROs was followed by a steep intra-euro area convergence in bank lending rates. That is: countries in which the economic recovery had previously been lagging behind the euro area average benefitted from particularly strong declines in bank lending rates.    This toolkit has formed the backbone of ECB monetary policy for almost three years, which initiated a pronounced expansion of our balance sheet (Chart 4). At the same time, the package had to be adjusted at times in response to the evolving situation. In particular, such adjustments became necessary to counteract the sequence of external shocks that, between summer 2015 and summer 2016, have created headwinds for the euro area economy, thereby slowing down the firming of its recovery.  Moreover, in March 2016, the Governing Council also reactivated the TLTROs to prevent the market turmoil that prevailed at the start of 2016 from undermining the progress that had previously materialised with regard to bank intermediation. As bank lending conditions normalised subsequently at a relatively quick pace, the planned TLTROs were let to run their course. While credit drawn by banks under this facility will be outstanding for the next three to four years, the facility itself is not an active instrument today.     As a consequence, while all the instruments – including indeed the credit extended to banks under the previous TLTROs – interact to determine the stance prevailing today, the main source of easing at present comes from the interaction between the APP, the moderately negative short-term interest rate and the forward guidance on both these policy tools.  Our forward guidance clarifies the relationship between our two main instruments. It sets the conditionality that governs them and the sequencing of their phasing out. It also provides information about their expected life. With the last DFR reduction in March 2016, the APP became the margin along which the Governing Council can still ease policy to a meaningful degree if needed. Keeping policy rates at their present level for the entire life of the APP is an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact. This is why we have coordinated the guidance about our key interest rates and our asset purchases very carefully and, since March 2016, we have consistently communicated that our key policy rates are expected “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.”  The appropriate calibration of this set of instruments is of course always a highly complex exercise and requires a broad range of analytical inputs and policy judgement. It works backward: from a desired medium term inflation outlook – one which is most consistent with the objective and with its numerical clarification that the Governing Council announced in May 2003 – to the broad financing conditions that can support that outlook, to the calibration of the Governing Council’s instruments that can foster those financing conditions. Concretely, these exercises start from the Governing Council’s assessment of the prospects for inflation to return to levels that are close to 2% by a meaningful time frame and with a reasonable degree of confidence. If the prospects for achieving that desired outcome are too weak, the Governing Council will form a view on the degree of accommodation that is necessary to make that outcome less uncertain. Working backwards, this exercise is designed to promote the level and shape of the yield curve that, according to past regularities, can be expected to deliver the requisite amount of stimulus, taking into account the endogenous adjustment of the whole spectrum of market conditions – including bank lending rates, corporate bonds, mortgages, as well as the foreign exchange rate – to the yield curve.  But the decision process is never mechanical. All along, the Governing Council combines the indications coming from models and past empirical regularities with its own judgement. In engaging in this layer of judgemental deliberations, our intent is to come to a firm assessment of the balance between the likely efficacy of our measures and their potential costs in term of financial distortions.  How do our main policy instruments work? Ensuring an appropriate interest rate environment throughout the yield curve is instrumental in fostering the financing conditions that are most conducive to our objective. A central bank can seek to influence the level and shape of the yield curve by acting on two components of the long-term interest rates: the expectations component and the term premium. The expectations component reflects market expectations of the future path of the policy-controlled short-term interest rates. All else equal, a path that is lower and shallower tends to produce a lower level of long-term yields and a flatter curve. The term premium reflects the excess return that an investor demands as a compensation for holding a bond with a long, say ten-year, residual maturity relative to rolling over a short-term bill for ten years. Locking themselves into a long-dated fixed income investment for a period of time is not equivalent to rolling over a short-term investment for the same period, because holding a long-dated bond exposes the investor to the risk that interest rates may increase unexpectedly during the holding period. An unexpected increase in interest rates causes a loss on the portfolio. So, the term premium – the excess return – is typically positive: it compensates investors for taking on such interest rate (or duration) risk. How does the interplay between the APP and our short-term interest rate policy enter this simple logic? Suppose the level and shape of the yield curve prevailing at a given point in time is judged to be inconsistent with a set of financing conditions that are sufficiently accommodative to foster a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. How could the two main instruments of current policy be deployed to change this state of affairs in an environment in which the short-term interest rate cannot be lowered meaningfully? Simplifying a great deal, one could say that the forward guidance on short-term interest rates – our stated expectation that the ECB’s key interest rates will remain “at their present levels for an extended period of time” – should be calibrated in a way to anchor the short-to-medium maturities of the yield curve – those portions most sensitive to short-term interest rate expectations and, therefore, to forward guidance – around levels that are sufficiently steady and low. In this respect, a mildly negative DFR has proved to be particularly powerful in controlling and anchoring these maturities, which are key to pricing bank credit in the euro area. The notion that zero was not the effective lower bound has exerted additional flattening pressure on the short-to-intermediate maturities of the yield curve, those to which banks tend to index loans with adjustable interest rates. This has amplified the reach-out potential of the stimulus relative to a situation in which our policy rates had been reduced to levels no lower than zero.[3] Consistent with this mechanism, the OIS forward curve underwent a striking downward shift and flattening, once we launched our monetary policy package in mid-2014, especially in the short-to-medium segment of the curve, which is arguably most indicative of investors’ short-term rate expectations (Chart 5).    The APP applies further pressure on longer-term interest rates along the curve, mainly by compressing the term premium. This is supported, for instance, by decompositions of long-term interest rates based on term-structure models indicating that the downward impact in the run-up to and around the announcement of APP mainly reflected a compression of term premia (Chart 6). How does the APP influence the term premium? The APP extracts duration risk from the market. Markets see duration risk as a potential source of portfolio losses, so they want to hedge against it, and the compensation for hedging is precisely what we call the term premium. If this premium is high, it makes long-term borrowing more expensive than short-term borrowing. If, at times of disinflation and weak growth, long-term borrowing is to be made more affordable so as to promote investment and durable consumption, then the central bank can try to absorb part of the duration risk that otherwise would have to be held by private investors. This can be done by purchasing long-dated bonds, as the ECB did under its APP. With less long-dated bonds to hold in the aggregate, private investors have more balance sheet capacity to hedge against the amount of duration risk that remains in the market, and more risk-bearing power to re-deploy funds to other investments, including the financing of productive capital. As a consequence, the desired compensation for hedging decreases, which drives down the term premium and the whole yield curve. This same mechanism spurs propagation. Duration extraction is the catalyst for the portfolio rebalancing channel, which is the chief mechanism by which easing through quantitative interventions propagates through the entire economy.     In practice, distinguishing between the effects of the APP and of forward guidance on the two components of long-term interest rates is less straightforward. The credibility of promises to follow a certain course of action for setting the policy rates in the future is almost certainly enhanced by the asset purchase programmes today, as these purchases are a concrete demonstration of a desire to provide additional stimulus. In other words, there is a signalling channel inherent in asset purchases, which reinforces the credibility of the forward guidance on policy rates via the expectations channel. Conversely, forward guidance may affect the term premium component of longer-term yields by reducing the uncertainty about the future path of short-term interest rates and thereby reducing duration risk in the market. Accordingly, the net stimulus provided by asset purchases depends in part on expectations of how policymakers will adjust short-term interest rates in the future.  But these additional complexities do not alter, and in fact reinforce, the key insight – namely that the different policy tools must be seen as mutually complementary elements of a package. The sequencing between policy tools, as we have described it in our forward guidance since March 2016, with rates expected “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”, is motivated by this insight.  For example: letting the expectations component of longer-term yields float upwards while, at the same time, engaging in asset purchases would be an inefficient conduct of policy. The compression of yields through the asset purchases would be directly countered by an upward drift in the expectations component. By contrast, the established sequencing helps anchor the expectations component and thereby allows the APP to exert its full effect.  Calibrating APP While fostering the appropriate interest rate environment is a critical intermediate condition enabling the transmission of our policies, in the end we do not directly control the yield curve. We can influence the yield curve only indirectly, through forward guidance and, notably, via modulating the size and intensity of our asset purchases. This process is mediated and to some extent difficult to forecast: we change our instruments and let markets determine the asset price implications of our actions. But, importantly, this process preserves the ability of markets to express views about the creditworthiness of the financial assets that are to be priced. Indeed the last year has demonstrated that, despite the ECB’s forward guidance on short-term interest rates and its continuing presence in the market as a large investor, market prices have tended to reflect investors’ evolving views about the prospective standing of sovereign issuers’ credit. With this in mind, let me turn now to the challenge of calibrating the size and duration of purchases that can deliver that yield constellation and, indirectly, the set of financing conditions consistent with our objective. For this, we rely on the current theory and empirics of quantitative interventions by central banks. The theory available today stipulates that it is primarily by announcing that the central bank will withdraw a certain stock of long-term bonds at a certain horizon, and thus a share of duration risk that otherwise would have to be borne by the market, that an asset purchase programme can impact on the term premium and on the yield curve in general.  It is important to emphasise that it is the amount of duration that we extract relative to the amount of duration that otherwise would be in the market that produces the impact. In this respect, keeping the size of the APP portfolio constant at a certain nominal level does not necessarily safeguard a given amount of accommodation. By keeping the portfolio of assets acquired under the APP constant in nominal terms, it is difficult to prevent the ageing of the portfolio, i.e. its gradual loss of duration as the securities held in the portfolio mature. Although re-investments of the proceeds from principal payments of the maturing securities can, to a certain extent, offset this endogenous decay of the average portfolio duration – by replacing short-term expiring securities with the purchase of longer-term securities – this substitution effect is generally not strong enough to maintain the average maturity of the portfolio relative to that of the market portfolio at a level consistent with a desired yield curve. In addition, of course, the amount of duration that is supplied to the market by public and private issuers is not constant and indeed typically trends up. Thus, keeping the central bank portfolio steady at a certain nominal level means that, in relative terms, the fraction of duration risk that is withdrawn from the market tends to fall. As time passes, the endogenous loss of duration in the central bank portfolio is bound to exert increasing upward pressure on the term premium.  When the Governing Council will eventually judge that a sustained adjustment is likely to be completed within a medium term horizon with a sufficiently high degree of confidence, this endogenous process will act as a self-correction mechanism. In those conditions, the higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions still attractive even as nominal borrowing costs will tend to rise. From today’s point of view, we are still some distance away from a sustained adjustment. As we concluded at our last monetary policy meeting, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term.  Before drawing to a close, let me address one additional issue related to the calibration of the APP, namely the horizon for executing the purchases.  We have traditionally communicated our (re-)calibrations of the APP in terms of two parameters: the pace of monthly purchases and an intentional end date, which is however always conditional on a sustained adjustment. The two parameters have facilitated market participants’ calculus of the extra stimulus implied by each of our successive rounds of (re-)calibrations: by multiplying pace by the horizon, markets have been able to identify the size of the portfolio which is relevant for pricing the term premium. What we have seen is that, if confronted with a higher monthly pace in exchange for a shorter intentional horizon or, conversely, a lower pace in exchange for a longer intentional horizon, the reaction in the markets has been varying through time. In more tense market conditions, a higher purchase pace in the near term is generally seen as having a higher easing potential. Probably, in conditions in which uncertainty is high, frontloading the accumulation of a given stock of purchases more forcefully signals the central bank’s commitment to inject the degree of accommodation necessary to support the recovery. By contrast, in more normal market conditions, the market’s capacity to engage in intertemporal arbitrage improves. Consequently, investors may become “more patient”, or, in other words, better able to evaluate the stimulus that can be expected to come from a purchase plan that is to be executed over a more extended time interval.  Conclusion While the euro area recovery remains solid, broad-based and resilient, the economy has yet to make sufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels that are consistent with the Governing Council’s aim. To support such sustained adjustment, the ECB has resorted to a package of complementary policy measures and recalibrated this package at various occasions in line with the evolving macroeconomic conditions, most notably the outlook for price stability, and the state of monetary policy transmission. In the next few weeks, the Governing Council will again assess how all these factors can be expected to influence the monetary policy stance and will re-calibrate its instruments accordingly, with a view to delivering the monetary policy impulse that is still necessary to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation in a way that is consistent with our monetary policy aim.

      "['2017-10-09', 'Sabine Lautenschläger', 'Between low interest rates and bond purchases - has European monetary policy reached a dead end?', 'Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Hohenheim University, Stuttgart, 9 October 2017', '  Between low interest rates and bond purchases - has European monetary policy reached a dead end?   Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Hohenheim University, Stuttgart, 9 October 2017  [ This text has been amended on 12 October 2017 to correct a translation error from the original German version ]  Central bankers could lead such an easy and quiet life. They are independent, they have a clear goal – price stability – and they have a powerful tool to reach it – the interest rate. Along these lines, in 2000 Mervyn King claimed that: “A successful central bank should be boring.” He added that a central bank should be “like a referee whose success is judged by how little his or her decisions intrude into the game itself.” Well, that was 17 years ago, and we all know that history can change course in an instant. That’s what happened in autumn 2008 when the financial crisis erupted. Looking back, the signs had been there for quite some time – hindsight is always 20/20. For about a year before the crisis, tremors in the financial system could already be felt. But on 15 September 2008, the big earthquake finally struck. On that day, an American investment bank failed: Lehman Brothers. The US government did not step in to support it, confounding market expectations. That was a sound decision in principle, but it sent the markets into a tailspin. The panic button had been well and truly pressed. Within a few days, the crisis had spread around the globe and brought the financial system to the brink of collapse. The situation eventually stabilised, but that was not the end of the story. In the wake of the financial crisis, the global economy entered what we now call the “Great Recession”. Shortly afterwards, the euro area went through a banking and sovereign debt crisis. And the life of central bankers? Well, it changed. Their institutions were no longer referees, as Mervyn King had said; they had become players in the game. For some time, it even seemed as if they were the only players on the pitch, in particular when other policymakers were unable to react quickly to the crisis. Central banks became crisis managers. For the ECB, this meant that its goal remained the same – maintaining price stability. However, achieving that goal suddenly became much more difficult. It had to reach deeper into its toolbox than it ever had before. It had to find new ways to use existing tools, and even invent entirely new ones. All this made some people uneasy. Particularly here in Germany, people see the new role and the new tools of the ECB as something risky. They are concerned that the low interest rates might destroy future wealth and ruin their retirement plans.  Outside Germany, however, the ECB has won respect for its forceful response to the crisis. People are focusing on the fact that the ECB helped to prevent worse things from happening. And some might even think that it could have done more. So which view is right? Did the ECB save the euro and protect Europe from a crisis that could have been much worse? Or has it overreached and entered a dead-end road where it will eventually get stuck? This is a tricky question because, while it seems to focus on the past, it’s the future which holds the answer. So let us do three things. First, let’s look back and ask what has happened so far. Second, let’s take a look at the present and ask where we are right now. And third, let’s look ahead and ask where we go from here. The past – thinking outside the (tool)box So the past is where we begin. In this case, 15 September 2008 – the day Lehman Brothers failed. And that was the death blow for something that was already severely wounded: trust. Banks around the world started worrying about their exposures to what were known as subprime mortgage loans. Through new financial instruments, the risks from these loans had been spread across the banking sector – in very opaque ways. Banks did not know how many of these risks were on the balance sheets of their business partners. And they did not know how to price these risks on their own balance sheets. Trust disappeared; banks stopped lending to each other and the interbank market broke down. There was a high risk that even healthy banks would run short of liquidity and fail. That was a serious problem, given how important banks are for the economy. A meltdown of the banking system would have been fatal for the economy. And it would also have been a problem for monetary policy and price stability. After all, the banks transmit standard monetary policy to the real economy. At that point, the ECB deployed one of the classic tools of central banking. It stepped in as lender of last resort. It gave banks unlimited access to liquidity at longer terms and against a wider set of collateral. And it began to buy covered bonds, which were a prime source of funding for banks. The ECB’s goal was to keep otherwise healthy banks alive. Stabilising the banks was crucial to safeguarding price stability. However, as a lender of last resort, the ECB can only do one thing – provide liquidity to banks. It cannot and should not solve banks’ underlying problems. In 2008, many banks were still bloated with bad debt. Their problems went far beyond a mere shortage of liquidity. They were about to fail. That was the moment when governments stepped in to save the banks and to prevent a systemic crisis. This added to the pile of public debt that many governments had built up over the preceding years. And then the pile became too big for some countries. The stage had been set for the second phase of the crisis. In 2010, concerns started to grow in the markets that the Greek state might default on its debt. The sovereign debt crisis had begun. Similar fears spread to other countries. Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy faced rising borrowing costs, although the reasons for this were not always the same. This added to doubts about their public finances. Once again, the banks were at risk; this time because they had many government bonds on their balance sheets. On top of that, government bonds are a key benchmark for borrowing costs in the private sector. When markets arrive at a critical assessment of a country’s public debt, they put a risk premium on the private sector of that country. In this case, Greek companies were suddenly faced with much higher interest rates than otherwise identical German companies.  A financial market that had grown together over years broke apart; it became much more fragmented. And that made it much more difficult to implement a single monetary policy. So once again the ECB had to step in to ensure that monetary policy remained effective. It began to buy government bonds through its Securities Markets Programme, SMP for short. For a while the SMP helped to rein in uncontrolled surges in government bond yields. This ensured that monetary policy remained effective. However, in 2012 it became clear that more was needed as markets had gone one step further. They had begun to price in a break-up of the euro area. The borrowing costs of governments surged, and the banks got into trouble. In that situation, the ECB pledged to do “whatever it takes within its mandate” to preserve the euro. It announced that it would stand ready to buy government bonds of specific countries. This programme was termed OMT, short for outright monetary transactions. It was subject to strict conditions, of course; I will spare you the details. Right from the start, the OMT programme was described as a game changer. It restored trust in the euro area and, as a result, there was actually no need to activate it. But the euro area was still caught in a recession, and growth slowed even further. The crisis had entered its third phase. As the economy slowed down, inflation fell. To revive it, the ECB cut interest rates twice in 2013, to a new low of 0.25%. But, in the following year, inflation declined further and even fell below 0% in December 2014. Among other things, this was due to a fall in oil prices. It became clear that the ECB needed to do more. It had to prevent low inflation from becoming entrenched or even turning into deflation. But what could be done? With interest rates close to zero, the standard tools were only of limited use. The ECB’s Governing Council thus decided to take three non-standard measures. First, it broke through the zero lower bound of interest rates. In June 2014, the deposit rate was set to -0.10%. This gave banks an incentive to stop depositing their money at the ECB and pushed them to lend it to the real economy instead. At the same time, the ECB’s decision made clear to the markets that interest rates can fall below zero. Markets adjusted their expectations about future interest rates, and this caused long-term interest rates to fall as well. Second, the ECB provided longer-term refinancing to banks at very low rates. The amount that banks can borrow is linked to their loans to private companies and households. This should stimulate bank lending to the real economy, and make it easier for private companies and consumers to take out loans. And third, the ECB used the tool of quantitative easing. Since March 2015, it has bought more than €2 trillion worth of public and private assets. Among other things, this brings down long-term interest rates via various channels. At the same time, ECB made it clear that it is committed to its goal of price stability. The present – not quite there yet So these are the measures that were taken. But where have they taken us? I think everyone would agree that they have taken us into uncharted territory. Some might say that they have taken us close to the limits of the ECB’s mandate. And others might even argue that they have taken us past those limits. At the same time, many people here in Germany argue that the ECB’s policy has many negative effects. They feel that low interest rates penalise savers, hurt banks and destroy wealth. It is true, of course, that low interest rates have many effects. Some of these are intentional – they make it cheaper to borrow money, spur investment, revive growth and, eventually, stimulate inflation. But they also have unintended side effects. So yes, for savers low interest rates do mean that their money accumulates at a much slower pace than before. However, most people are not just savers – they also need to borrow money from time to time. And that’s when low interest rates benefit them; when they borrow money to buy a house, for instance. The same applies to those who need a loan to set up a company. It is a fact that monetary policy redistributes wealth. It always does, and there is no way around it. Low interest rates are good for borrowers and bad for savers. It’s exactly the reverse with high interest rates: they’re bad for borrowers and good for savers. But the ECB would not be fulfilling its mandate if these effects kept it from securing price stability. The ECB is responsible for price stability and price stability only. It is up to governments and parliaments to sort out redistribution policy. Against that backdrop, the decision to lower interest rates was justified. And, in any case, what would the alternative have been? Savers might initially have been happy with higher interest rates, but the economy would have faltered. And over the medium to long term, savers would have felt that pain, too. That said, there are other side effects of low interest rates that we must keep an eye on. Among other things, they set wrong incentives. This can lead to bubbles in the financial markets which eventually burst and hurt the economy. So while low interest rates are justified, they have side effects. And these side effects grow over time, while the intended effects of expansive monetary policy wear off. The same is true of the bond purchases. They took us even further into uncharted territory. While they do have a desired effect on financial markets, they also have side effects similar to those of low interest rates. And, over time, these side effects could even threaten financial stability. But we won’t be able to gauge the overall costs and benefits of our non-standard measures until many years have passed.  As for today, we could continue discussing all these things for hours on end. They are complex – and important. They directly affect the role of the central bank, its powers and its limits. However, there is another question I would like to consider. And this question is equally important. Did the measures work? Did they help us achieve our goal – an inflation rate of close to, but below, 2%? Well, obviously, inflation is still some way from our goal. But does that mean the ECB’s policy has failed? No, of course not. Monetary policy never influences prices directly. The mechanism for transmitting a monetary policy impulse to the real economy, and driving a change in prices, involves many different steps. The first step is that low interest rates, bond purchases and other tools influence conditions in financial markets. They should make it easier for companies and people to borrow money. And that’s what we have seen. Since 2014, lending rates for non-financial corporations and households have fallen a lot – by 119 and 100 basis points, respectively. And for small and medium-sized enterprises, they have even fallen further. That is important because these companies provide most of the jobs in the euro area. At the same time, lending rates in different countries have become less dispersed; the financial market has grown closer together again. So far, the measures taken have had the desired effect. The second step is that conditions in financial markets influence economic growth. Companies can invest more, people can buy more goods and services, more jobs are created and the economy grows. And we have seen that as well. Growth has returned to the euro area, and so have jobs. We can look back on 17 quarters of economic growth and an unemployment rate that has fallen from around 12% to around 9%. Confidence is growing and demand is increasing. People in Europe have started spending again, and that supports the recovery. And the recovery is not confined to a few countries; it has taken hold across the euro area. The third and final step is that stronger economic growth influences prices. As the economy comes closer to its full potential, production factors become scarcer. The supply of labour, for instance, begins to dry up. This boosts wages, which prompts companies to raise prices – and inflation returns. And it is here that we have got a bit stuck. Inflation has picked up, but not as fast as we would have expected. So what is holding it down? Low oil and commodity prices are one factor. From January 2014 to January 2016, oil prices fell by about 70%. That is quite a drag on inflation, as you can imagine. And it acts as a brake not just on headline inflation, which includes energy prices, but also on underlying inflation, which excludes them, because energy is an input for so many other products and services. But there are other factors which also weigh on inflation. And the labour market is the place to look for them. After all, wages play a key role in inflation dynamics. If wages go up, inflation goes up. However, wages seem to be growing quite slowly even though the economy is recovering strongly. Why is that? Well, one possibility is that the economy might be further from its full potential than we think. In that case, the labour market would be less tight, wages would not rise, and that would hold down inflation. And indeed it seems that the headline unemployment rate doesn’t reflect some of the slack in the labour market. Using broader measures of unemployment reveals that the labour market is less tight than the general unemployment rate suggests. A second factor is that inflation only tends to affect wages after a certain amount of time has passed. So the very low inflation from the past is still dampening wage growth. This has offset some of the effects that stem from an improved labour market, and is another reason why wages are reacting more slowly than usual to economic growth. And then there is the question of whether something more fundamental has changed. Has inflation become less sensitive to changes in the real economy? Has the Phillips curve become flatter? It seems that it did become flatter during the crisis in ways that make inflation slower to react to economic growth. However, it may well be that the curve steepens again once the economy reaches its full potential. So what does all this mean? The key message is that all the factors that are holding down inflation seem to be temporary. And this means two things. First – we need to be patient. Inflation will react to the economic recovery; it will just do so slowly due to various factors. But over the medium term, it will return to our goal. It’s just a question of time. And we have the time, because we made the decision to define our goal with a view to the medium term: inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. And second – we need to maintain our expansive monetary policy to bring inflation back on a stable trend towards our goal. But does that mean that monetary policies must continue as they are currently calibrated? Do we still need to continue adding assets to our balance sheet, for example? I don’t think so.  I think we should begin reducing our bond purchases next year. This should be done gradually, until we are no longer purchasing additional bonds. [Updated] I think it is time next year to gradually but completely roll back net purchases of bonds. For even if we allow our net purchases to come to an end, monetary policy will remain expansive.  For even if we phased out our net purchases of bonds entirely, some monetary accommodation would remain in place. This is because we reinvest all the money from maturing bonds. So the total volume of bonds would initially remain constant, as would the expansive effects. On top of that, our standard monetary policy measures would continue to have an effect as well. And this takes me to the final part of my speech: the future. The future – coming closer  Looking to the future, we can be confident that inflation will return to our objective. Thus, we need to think about how we can bring our unconventional measures to an end. We need to look ahead and design the exit. After all, it will be a major event for markets and the economy. And this links to another important issue: communication. For a long time, central banks and monetary policy were very opaque. In the 1980s, Alan Greenspan claimed that he had to learn “Fedspeak” when he became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He “learned to mumble with great incoherence”. Back then central banks were secretive about monetary policy and vague, at best, when speaking to the markets. So markets had to find ways to second-guess what the central bank was up to. Some of these ways were a bit odd. Alan Greenspan’s briefcase was one of the more inventive indicators. Whenever the Federal Reserve had a meeting to discuss monetary policy, the markets apparently observed Alan Greenspan’s briefcase. If it was bulging, markets concluded that interest rates would change; if it was thin, they concluded that no change was likely. In the end, such ways of gauging what the central bank is up to are quite unreliable. Markets might easily draw the wrong conclusions and this might lead to unwanted volatility and turbulence. That is one of the reasons why today, almost everyone agrees that central banks need to be transparent. It helps them to steer the expectations of markets and make their policies more effective. At the same time, it helps them be more accountable. Both of these things have become even more important against the backdrop of our unconventional measures. So we need to communicate very carefully on our next steps. We must help markets get an idea of what the exit will look like. And we mustn’t confuse them with vague or ambiguous ideas. We have to strike a delicate balance. And in my view, we need to find this balance now. As of today, it is clear which sequence the exit will follow. Bond purchases will come to an end, while interest rates will remain low, well past the horizon of net asset purchases. [Updated]The first step will be to cut the net purchases of bonds. Interest rates on the other hand will remain low, well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.  But we still need to decide on a timeframe. From my point of view, it is important that we really move towards the exit – step by step, but steadily and in a clear direction. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I began by saying that the days of “boring” central banking are over. And I do hope that I have shown that to be true. What is safe to say, though, is that central banks have stepped into the limelight and become a focal point of public debate. And it is a controversial debate. Some argue that the ECB handled the crisis well. Others are much more critical. Who is right? Today I have argued that, given the low inflation, monetary policy needed to be expansive. Admittedly, the appropriate degree of expansion and the necessary tools are moot points. In any case, we must bear in mind that some of the ECB’s more unconventional tools also have side effects. And these side effects will grow in magnitude the longer the tools are used. So, the future holds the final answer to our question of whether monetary policy was optimally calibrated. If we manage to put the unconventional tools back into the box when the time comes, we will be able to claim that the ECB successfully achieved its objective. And in my view, this time has come. We need to discuss how to exit from our unconventional monetary policy, and then we need to do it. My opinion is clear: we should begin to scale back our bond purchases at the beginning of next year. When we bring our unconventional measures to an end, it will mark the last chapter of this turbulent tale. Let’s hope that we can then go back to our quiet and boring former life. Thank you very much for your attention.     SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   Find out more Banking Supervision   ']\n",

There will be a few changes to the parameters, and maybe a constraint or two added like temple lamps, but apparently they never learn.” [1]   John Dizard The policy maker’s environment is a multi-faceted one. She or he faces a continually changing economic landscape. Let me give you some specific examples. Economic data -- upon which we base our policy decisions -- appear at different times and with different qualities: for instance, some economic series (such as trade and investment data) are subject to considerable revision over time. Moreover, the transmission lags of monetary policy changes are often long, uncertain, and perhaps even contingent on the state of economy (for example whether it is an expansionary or contractionary phase). Last, but certainly not least, policy making itself does not operate in a vacuum or in a laboratory. There is the practical backdrop of legal, constitutional, cultural, and political economy constraints etc.  Experience, judgement and the acknowledgement of uncertainty are key parts of that environment, and key parts of the policy maker’s outlook. To help assess economic developments and to facilitate policy discussion, though, central banks use a variety of macroeconomic models and econometric tools.  Despite the sophisticated tools and analysis at our disposal, the uncertainty underlining the policy environment is pervasive. Accordingly, I believe policy makers must show humility in their understanding of how the economy works, and how policy works. Before the financial crisis many distinguished policy makers and academics treated economics and finance as if it had attained something of a natural science – replete with regularities upon which most economists could, and seemingly did, agree. Indeed, some even declared the business cycle dead. The doubters meanwhile (among them Robert Gordon, Raghuram Rajan, Robert Shiller) were either neglected or – what is worse – labelled luddites. The global financial crisis challenged such complacency. In effect, it shone a light on our over confidence and, exposed our very lack of humility. More philosophically, the crisis also suggested that we, as a profession, had perhaps lost touch with an older tradition of economics that had precisely sought to emphasise uncertainty, the limits of information, and the wider social context underlining economic interactions -- as for instance, highlighted by von Mises and Hayek “economic calculation problem” and Hayek’s “fatal conceit” which submits that knowledge is dispersed across society and can never truly be known by any one agent or entity[2] - a fact that the former chief economist of the ECB, Otmar Issing, never failed to remind us of. Notwithstanding, the inescapable fact is that policy makers must make decisions under uncertainty. Such uncertainty is not, in addition, a temporary phenomenon that we can wait out. As former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (2003) wrote:   “... uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape”. [3]  Given this complexity and the need to stabilize market expectations, policy makers have traditionally relied on a variety of macro-econometric and statistical models. These tools come with many caveats. Indeed, many were the first to point an accusatory finger at such modelling frameworks in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  The main criticisms were that models were missing key features of the economy (e.g. financial interactions) and/or were based on unrealistic assumptions. [4] Examples of the latter include the assumption of “complete” and “efficient” markets as well as of “rational” expectations. These features make it difficult for models to speak to real-world phenomena such as herd behaviour in markets, asset price misalignments, sudden stops etc. The overreliance on mathematics and models leads to a failure of acknowledging the crucial role of social behaviour.  Of course, all models make simplifying assumptions, otherwise they wouldn’t be models. Or, as the statistician George Box famously noted, “All models are wrong; some models are useful.” Indeed, there is an active research agenda to incrementally but carefully improve our existing models: examples include integrating “financial frictions” and so-called heterogeneous agents which inject more realistic dynamics. Moreover, many have also sought out insights from machine learning and big data techniques, and from behavioural and evolutionary economics. The latter try to explain departures from optimality in agents’ decisions, and integrate the social fabric and consumer heuristics underlying economic behaviour. As the economy advances and grows yet more complex, innovation in our modelling and statistical frameworks will undoubtedly continue, but fail in its pretention to encapsulate human complexity in an equation.  The fact that all models are wrong does not preclude their combination from being useful. We know that combining models – even often using simple pairing rules – regularly outperform the best individual model in forecasting exercises. Likewise, the robust policy literature has combined macroeconomic models to ask which types of policies are likely to work well across many different models and scenarios. [5] This seems a reasonable research agenda, although it is unclear if the models are close to being useful for analysis of macro-prudential and financial stability issues. [6] Macro-prudential policy is a good example of this pretence lacking even a capacity to define its own objective otherwise then by its negative. In the remainder of my remarks I will elaborate on the challenges faced by central banks related to uncertainty. I highlight merits and limitations of models, and I comment on different area that researchers are currently working on. Monetary policy and financial regulation under uncertainty Uncertainty is the defining characteristic of monetary policy landscape. The literature distinguishes several types, so it is worth starting by describing it to continue later on how economists have thought about it and how they have tried to tackle it. First, there is Knightian uncertainty. This is the type of uncertainty that is immeasurable and thus not possible to calculate. Typically it relates to the inability of agents or decision makers to reasonably contemplate all the possible states of nature or characterize their probability distributions. If, on the other hand, the realization of the states of nature is not known in advance but agents can reasonably contemplate all such states and their likelihood, this situation is commonly known as risk (the second type of uncertainty).  Others tend to distinguish between aleatory (or objective) uncertainty and epistemic (or subjective).[7] Ultimately, all uncertainty relevant for decision making is subjective, but for practical purposes it is worth making the distinction because there are cumulative effects of the two uncertainties that can explain events such as the financial crisis. As Oliver Blanchard commented:   “… what is at work is not only objective, but also subjective uncertainty … Subjective uncertainty is about “unknown unknowns”. When, as today, the unknown unknowns dominate, and the economic environment is so complex as to appear nearly incomprehensible, the result is extreme prudence, if not outright paralysis, on the part of investors, consumers and firms. And this behaviour, in turn, feeds the crisis”.[8]   Uncertainty can be related to many dimensions relevant to policy making, including (i) uncertainty about the current state of the economy, (ii) uncertainty about its structure; and (iii) uncertainty over the way economic agents form expectations about future developments and future policy actions. Let me give you some concrete examples of such dimensions relying on unobservables. First, consider the famous Taylor rule. This relates changes in monetary policy rates to changes in inflation and the output gap, anchored around some notion of the equilibrium real interest rate. By and large, the rule assumes fixed coefficients for these feedbacks. Even though policy makers never mechanically follow such a rule, over a long horizon, it can ex post provide a good description of monetary-policy setting. Policy-making, however, as opposed to academia is forward looking – unless one believes with Karl Marx that history repeats itself as a farce.  Consider now the effect of monetary policy when interest rates are around their effective lower bound. Given the limited experience policy makers have of such episodes, there is deep uncertainty as to whether the normal rules of the game (i.e., the coefficients of the Taylor rule) will continue to provide a broad guide for monetary decisions. Moreover, estimates of potential output and thus the output gap have inevitably been blurred by the scarring of the financial crisis, as well as by rapid technological changes throughout the last decades.[9] In line with this, at the Bank for Internal Settlements, Borio has argued that we must supplement traditional measures of output gaps with measures of financial imbalances and credit cycles.[10] There is however no unambiguous way to do this given the many different methods of filtering data and extracting trend and cycle. Moreover, macroeconomic data samples are limited relative to the infrequent nature of crises to make these discriminations. Likewise, forecasts of inflation are increasingly difficult to make in a globalized world: there are many common trends in inflation determinants, and common shocks such as in commodity prices. Accordingly, domestic factors – such as wage setting – may matter far less than before.  Finally, estimates of the so-called natural real rate of interest, always understood to be difficult to pin down, are in an interdependent world beset by many “headwinds” (e.g., population aging, potentially technical deceleration), as argued by Gordon.[11] It is very difficult to be able to say how such headwinds will evolve. In the same context other scholars even identify tailwinds: Brynjolfsson and McAfee find that technological advance has caused a drastic shift in the means of production, simultaneously boosting the productivity of firms which are however difficult to measure with traditional gauges.[12]  All of these examples relate to stabilization policy over the cycles – but it goes well beyond that. Consider regulatory policy, given the expansion in recent decades of the financial sector and its changing nature (e.g., the rise of shadow banking, FinTech), the optimal design of regulatory policy in such a changing landscape is profoundly complex. Uncertainty though does not (and cannot) prevent the central bank from taking informed decisions. How do we ensure that we avoid paralysis? Given the complexity and the need to stabilize market expectations, academics and researchers have traditionally relied on a variety of econometric models. Policy makers supplement these models, with expert judgement to shed light on economic developments. The use of models inevitably introduces other dimensions of uncertainty which all go under the name of model uncertainty. It is possible to classify risk within a model, where the uncertainty is about the outcomes that emerge in accordance with a model that specifies fully the outcome set of probabilities; and ambiguity among models, where the uncertainty is about which alternative model should be used. If the true model is not assumed to be among the original set of models under consideration, a third source of uncertainty emerges, i.e. model misspecification. Uncertainty has been one very important aspect of the policy environment and of the models used that the economic professions has been forced to think more deeply about with the financial crisis. But many other features of the models have been at the centre of the discussion.  Reflections on the Models Let me now elaborate more fully on policy models. Many prominent economists (from different perspectives) concluded that today’s mainstream macroeconomic models somehow had led the profession down the wrong path (Buiter, Krugman, Mankiw, Akerlof and Shiller).[13] In other words that these models suffer from misspecification. There are also examples in finance: mainstream financial economists possessed an incomplete understanding of the correlation of different assets, perhaps excessive faith in the risk-reducing potential of the securitization and a blinkered Gaussian mind-set.[14] In short they used models – often of great sophistication – but poorly combined them with judgement and experience. As we noted, many have reached a relatively positive assessment of policy models, and of the re-constructive abilities of the profession. Indeed, some others argued that the mistake was actually in not following models’ prescriptions closely enough. For instance John Taylor maintained that during the early 2000s, monetary policy in the US was set looser than that implied by the Taylor Rule. This, he claimed, caused the build-up of debt and risk-taking, which ultimately led to the onset of the Great Recession. Likewise, Michael Wicken concluded that   “… the financial crisis was brought about more by a failure to employ modern macroeconomics than by its failings. If used sensibly, it will lead us out of the crisis.” [15]  On the other side, those who criticize the types of macroeconomic models popular at central banks have argued that they mistook beauty for truth and were too complex and opaque to be used quickly. More recently Stiglitz posed another question highlighting one important flaw of models: why does the economy not quickly return to full employment, as one would have expected in an equilibrium model? Why do we persist in using models with such strongly counterfactual dynamics? More specifically the list of model troubles could include: linearity, rational expectations, complete markets, limited agent heterogeneity and financial imperfections.[16]  On a more general perspective, some set the discussion in terms of the fact that some models give the impression of the possibility to fine tune or socially “engineer” the economy whereas less standard approaches – also inspired by other disciplines – see the economy rather as an ever-evolving social system for which one can merely set the broad framework conditions and institutions. This goes back to an old debate started indeed with Ludwig von Mises, who first discussed the concept of catalaxy, and made popular later on by Friedrich Hayek who elaborated on that concept and defined it as follows: “… the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market”. Hayek particularly stressed his view in that respect in his lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel, The Pretence of Knowledge in which he forcefully challenged all those who believed that government had the wisdom or ability to successfully plan the economic affairs of society. His primary targets were the Keynesian economists at that time who were confident that they could manage the economy to assure full employment, economic growth, and market stability. Hayek’s more general antagonists were social engineers who wished to redesign and regulate society. The terms of the current debate are similarly along those lines. Way forward/implications for research and policy One possible reaction by fine-tuners to this uncertainty is to rely on Machine learning and Big Data techniques to deliver forecasts and enhance policy analysis. As the name implies, such techniques rely on large complex datasets to extract and manipulate correlations and regularities in the data that would otherwise be opaque. They have proved popular and valuable in many fields such as advertising, prediction, developing trading strategies, and so on. Indeed, as the economic historian Joel Mokyr provocatively wrote “… who needs causation as long as we have correlation?” [17]  Big Data, however intriguing, is no panacea. Such methods rely on often multi-dimensional correlations fitted (perhaps over-fitted!) on past data that may bear little relation to future events. Moreover, the relations uncovered by algorithms trawling vast datasets may identify false positives (in other words, relationships that essentially do not exist in the data and have no real-world justification). But more fundamentally, many problems in social sciences entail a combination of prediction but also causal inference. We need to know for example, if the central bank lowers interest rates below zero or engages in asset purchases, will that stimulate aggregate demand? Central banks have for the most part not engaged in these types of policy before so there is no (or very limited) historical correlation upon which we can fall back. To address such questions, we inevitably rely on our macro-econometric models to give us structure. During the crisis some believe to have seen many examples of policy insights from models (for example how the policy transmission changes in periods of low activity, high uncertainty and rates near their effective lower bound). Moreover, many interesting extensions were fashioned onto existing models in the wake of the crisis. However successful such extensions prove to be, there are still clearly (fairly tight) limits on how big policy models can be. The bigger models are, the more difficult it is to estimate and solve them; the more difficult it is to build a coherent narrative around them. Such narratives are an important ingredient in building consensus around where the economy is and how policy should advance. To lose the big picture in the details is not ideal. The bottom line is that whilst we should acknowledge the contribution our statistical and macroeconomic models make, we must also acknowledge their limitations and make improvements. We must recognize the presence of pervasive uncertainty. We must show humility.  There is hope, and an active research agenda. Useful insights on how to improve models come from behavioural and evolutionary economics (expectations, multiple equilibria, the effects of news, and asset market bubbles) -- as well as from the enhancement of models to include commercial banks, credit frictions, and uncertainty. Also, central banks have always been concerned with uncertainty and they always tried to take robust decisions.[18] They have also been confronted with the challenge to distinguish between short-term versus long-term, cyclical versus structural developments or deviations of various degrees versus dead ends. The main problem is the difficulty the policy maker faces in distinguishing between objective and subjective uncertainty, and how to cope with the latter.  Possible solutions to uncertainty are on the one hand to relax the assumption that a single probability number quantifies beliefs and assume that they can account on a set of them. The policy makers then act according to the belief that minimizes the excepted loss. On the other hand the risk aversion of policy makers towards the two types of uncertainties is not the same. Allowing for the distinction in the attitude towards uncertainty allows us to evaluate their role and quantify their importance. As already stressed, the crises increased the concern for uncertainty. The research agenda is also high on this topic.[19]  Conclusions If it did nothing else, the financial crisis served to remind us all of a few home truths. The economy is a profoundly complex setting. It is bound and shaped by history as well as by cultural and legal norms. If it can at all be conceived of as a model, such a model would have many moving parts and shifting parameters and volatilities. But even then, deep uncertainty inevitably remains – uncertainty about the underlying mechanisms and parameters and the lines of causality between those mechanisms. Many economists had in recent years perhaps forgotten that, but as I have argued the study of economics and many practitioners had not.  Let me be clear, an acknowledgement of uncertainty is not a recipe for nihilism. On the contrary, the ECB has shown great flexibility and ingenuity in dealing with the financial crisis. For instance, all the available evidence suggests that the range of asset purchases programme has led to material improvements in financial conditions and credit supply conditions in the euro area. The ECB has marshalled its many models and staff expertise to great effect in these last few admittedly difficult years.  Moreover, economists have made a sober assessment of the gaps in their modelling frameworks and made a serious, diligent, and ongoing attempt to fill them whilst retaining model tractability. In this cause we have and will be guided by the proliferation of large and detailed datasets in our macroeconomic and macro-prudential settings. And yet the benefit of experience, judgement, and – perhaps above all -- humility remains always to the fore.      [1] Dizard, John (2017).

Deflationary risks have disappeared and some measures of underlying inflation have ticked up over recent months. But overall inflation developments, despite the solid growth, have remained subdued. Accordingly, while we remain confident that inflation developments will eventually return to levels below, but close to, 2% our medium-term objective, the evidence still shows insufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards those levels. Such “sustained adjustment” is the principal contingency that has guided and will be guiding the introduction and withdrawal of our asset purchase programme (APP) and, indirectly, of all the main components of our present policy.  In my remarks today, I would like to outline the central role monetary policy plays in underpinning this recovery and to discuss the main mechanisms by which our measures have impacted on the economy. I will start from a brief overview of the monetary policy toolkit that the Governing Council has adopted over the last years, and I will sketch out the elements that are most relevant for the Governing Council’s deliberations about calibration of our policy measures. I will then highlight the key channels by which this toolkit transmits to financial conditions. Finally, I will focus on the APP, which plays a central role among the policy instruments.  The ECB’s monetary policy toolkit Over the last three years, the Governing Council has had to take bold measures to maintain price stability. The context in which we launched this package of measures, in June 2014, was one in which a sustained period of disinflation could have morphed into one of outright deflation. The Governing Council had to move beyond its conventional policy instruments and instead deploy a set of unconventional tools that were tailored to the specific challenges of that time. The first challenge related to the “zero” lower bound on interest rates. The leeway to cut policy-controlled short-term interest rates was insufficient to provide the degree of accommodation that was necessary to support the economy and fight off the threats to our objective. The second challenge related to a dysfunctional monetary transmission. Bank intermediation was significantly impaired, which had caused the transmission of policy stimulus to the broader economy to be too slow and uncertain. The unconventional tools were designed to act both on the quasi-risk-free yield curve and on bank lending margins. By “yield curve” I mean the term structure that we observe in the money market for overnight indexed interest rate swaps, as well as the curves in the markets for the national sovereign debts, which traditionally constitute an important benchmark for pricing credit to the entire economy. Due to this benchmark function, the level and shape of the yield curve are crucial determinants of prices of a whole range of longer-term financial assets, including those most closely tied to economic activity, such as bank lending rates, corporate bonds and mortgages. Our policy to influence intermediate and long-term yields has been instrumental in bringing the whole structure of credit conditions for households and companies to the accommodative levels necessary to arrest disinflation and strengthen the recovery.  As a complement to the impact of our measures on yield curves, our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (“TLTROs”) were specifically designed to compress bank lending rates – a key intermediate objective of the policy toolkit, given the important role that bank credit plays in financing the euro area economy. Through a number of mechanisms, the TLTROs have successfully bid down the level of bank lending rates on loans to households and companies while preserving banks’ overall margins.[1]  This toolkit has formed the backbone of ECB monetary policy for almost three years. At the same time, the package had to be adjusted at times in response to the evolving situation. In particular, such adjustments became necessary to counteract the sequence of external shocks that, between summer 2015 and summer 2016, have created headwinds for the euro area economy, thereby slowing down the firming of its recovery.  The Governing Council responded to the marked weakening in the euro area macroeconomic outlook which materialised towards the end of 2015, in a deteriorating global economic environment with persistently elevated financial market volatility, by announcing in March 2016 an extension of the minimum time horizon over which it would conduct the APP combined with a further reduction in the deposit facility rate (DFR). Moreover, it reactivated the TLTROs to prevent the market turmoil that prevailed at that time from undermining the progress that had previously materialised with regard to bank intermediation. As bank lending conditions normalised subsequently at a relatively quick pace, the planned TLTROs were let to run their course. While credit drawn by banks under this facility will be outstanding for the next three to four years, the facility itself is not an active instrument today.  As a consequence, while all the instruments – including indeed the credit extended to banks under the previous TLTROs – interact to determine the stance prevailing today, the main source of easing at present comes from the interaction between the APP, the moderately negative short-term interest rate and the forward guidance on both these policy tools. Our forward guidance clarifies the relationship between our two main instruments. It sets the conditionality that governs them and the sequencing of their phasing out. It also provides information about their expected life. With the last DFR reduction in March 2016, the APP became the margin along which the Governing Council can still ease policy to a meaningful degree if needed. Keeping policy rates at their present level for the entire life of the APP is an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact. This is why we have coordinated the guidance about our key interest rates and our asset purchases very carefully and, since March 2016, we have consistently communicated that our key policy rates are expected “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.”  The appropriate calibration of this set of instruments is of course always a highly complex exercise and requires a broad range of analytical inputs and policy judgement. It works backward: from a desired medium term inflation outlook – one which is most consistent with the objective and with its numerical clarification that the Governing Council announced in May 2003 – to the broad financing conditions that can support that outlook, to the calibration of the Governing Council’s instruments that can foster those financing conditions. Concretely, these exercises start from the Governing Council’s assessment of the prospects for inflation to return to levels that are close to 2% by a meaningful time frame and with a reasonable degree of confidence. If the prospects for achieving that desired outcome are too weak, the Governing Council will form a view on the degree of accommodation that is necessary to make that outcome less uncertain. Working backwards, this exercise is designed to promote the level and shape of the yield curve that, according to past regularities, can be expected to deliver the requisite amount of stimulus, taking into account the endogenous adjustment of the whole spectrum of market conditions – including bank lending rates, corporate bonds, mortgages, as well as the foreign exchange rate – to the yield curve.  But the decision process is never mechanical. All along, the Governing Council combines the indications coming from models and past empirical regularities with its own judgement. In engaging in this layer of judgemental deliberations, our intent is to come to a firm assessment of the balance between the likely efficacy of our measures and their potential costs in term of financial distortions.  How do our main policy instruments work? Ensuring an appropriate interest rate environment throughout the yield curve is instrumental in fostering the financing conditions that are most conducive to our objective. A central bank can seek to influence the level and shape of the yield curve by acting on two components of the long-term interest rates: the expectations component and the term premium. The expectations component reflects market expectations of the future path of the policy-controlled short-term interest rates. All else equal, a path that is lower and shallower tends to produce a lower level of the long-term yield and a flatter curve. The term premium reflects the excess return that an investor demands as a compensation for holding a bond with a long, say ten-year, residual maturity relative to rolling over a short-term bill for ten years. Locking themselves into a long-dated fixed income investment for a period of time is not equivalent to rolling over a short-term investment for the same period, because holding a long-dated bond exposes the investor to the risk that interest rates may increase unexpectedly during the holding period. An unexpected increase in interest rates causes a loss on the portfolio. So, the term premium – the excess return – is typically positive: it compensates investors for taking on such interest rate (or duration) risk. How does the interplay between the APP and our short-term interest rate policy enter this simple logic? Suppose the level and shape of the yield curve prevailing at a given point in time is judged to be inconsistent with a set of financing conditions that are sufficiently accommodative to foster a return of inflation to levels below and close to 2% over the medium term. How could the two main instruments of current policy be deployed to change this state of affairs in an environment in which the short-term interest rate cannot be lowered meaningfully? Simplifying a great deal, one could say that the forward guidance on short-term interest rates – our stated expectation that the ECB’s key interest rates will remain “at their present levels for an extended period of time” – should be calibrated in a way to anchor the short-to-medium maturities of the yield curve – those portions most sensitive to short-term interest rate expectations and, therefore, to forward guidance – around levels that are sufficiently steady and low. In this respect, a mildly negative DFR has proved to be particularly powerful in controlling and anchoring these maturities, which are key to pricing bank credit in the euro area. The notion that zero was not the effective lower bound has exerted additional flattening pressure on the short-to-intermediate maturities of the yield curve, those to which banks tend to index loans with adjustable interest rates. This has amplified the reach-out potential of the stimulus relative to a situation in which our policy rates had been reduced to levels no lower than zero.[2]  The APP applies further pressure on longer-term interest rates along the curve, mainly by compressing the term premium. Why does the APP influence the term premium? The mechanism operates principally by extracting duration risk from the market. Markets see duration risk as a potential source of portfolio losses, so they want to hedge against it, and the compensation for hedging is precisely what we call the term premium. If this premium is high, it makes long-term borrowing more expensive than short-term borrowing. If, at times of disinflation and weak growth, long-term borrowing is to be made more affordable so as to promote investment and durable consumption, then the central bank can try to absorb part of the duration risk that otherwise would have to be held by private investors. This can be done by purchasing long-dated bonds, as the ECB did under its APP. With less long-dated bonds to hold in the aggregate, private investors have more balance sheet capacity to hedge against the amount of duration risk that remain in the market, and more risk-bearing power to re-deploy funds to other investments, including the acquisition and financing of productive capital. As a consequence, the desired compensation for hedging will decrease, which will drive down the term premium and the whole yield curve. This same mechanism will spur propagation. Duration extraction is the catalyst for the portfolio rebalancing channel, which is the chief mechanism by which easing through quantitative interventions propagates through the entire economy.  In practice, distinguishing between the effects of the APP and of forward guidance on the two components of long-term interest rates is less straightforward. The credibility of promises to follow a certain course of action for setting the policy rates in the future is almost certainly enhanced by the asset purchase programmes today, as these purchases are a concrete demonstration of a desire to provide additional stimulus. In other words, there is a signalling channel inherent in asset purchases, which reinforces the credibility of the forward guidance on policy rates via the expectations channel. Conversely, forward guidance may affect the term premium component of longer-term yields by reducing the uncertainty about the future path of short-term interest rates and thereby reducing duration risk in the market. Accordingly, the net stimulus provided by asset purchases depends in part on expectations of how policymakers will adjust short-term interest rates in the future.  But these additional complexities do not alter, and in fact reinforce, the key insight – namely that the different policy tools must be seen as mutually complementary elements of a package. The sequencing between policy tools, as we have described it in our forward guidance since March 2016, with rates expected “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”, is motivated by this insight.  For example: letting the expectations component of longer-term yields float upwards while, at the same time, engaging in asset purchases would be an inefficient conduct of policy. The compression of yields through the asset purchases would be directly countered by an upward drift in the expectations component. By contrast, the established sequencing helps anchor the expectations component and thereby allows the APP to exert its full effect.  Calibrating APP While fostering the appropriate interest rate environment is a critical intermediate condition enabling the transmission of our policies, in the end we do not control the yield curve. We can influence the yield curve only indirectly, through forward guidance and, notably, via modulating the size and intensity of our asset purchases. This process is mediated and to some extent difficult to forecast: we change our instruments and let markets determine the asset price implications of our actions. But, importantly, this process preserves the ability of markets to express views about the creditworthiness of the financial assets that are to be priced. Indeed the last year has demonstrated that, despite the ECB’s forward guidance on short-term interest rates and its continuing presence in the market as a large investor, market prices have tended to reflect investors’ evolving views about the prospective standing of sovereign issuers’ credit. With this in mind, let me turn now to the challenge of calibrating the size and duration of purchases that can deliver that yield constellation and, indirectly, the set of financing conditions consistent with our objective. For this, we rely on the current theory and empirics of quantitative interventions by central banks. The theory available today stipulates that it is primarily by announcing that the central bank will withdraw a certain stock of long-term bonds at a certain horizon, and thus a share of duration risk that otherwise would have to be borne by the market, that an asset purchase programme can impact on the term premium and on the yield curve in general.  It is important to emphasise that it is the amount of duration that we extract relative to the amount of duration that otherwise would be in the market that produces the impact. In this respect, keeping the size of the APP portfolio constant at a certain nominal level does not necessarily safeguard a given amount of accommodation. By keeping the portfolio of assets acquired under the APP constant in nominal terms, it is difficult to prevent the ageing of the portfolio, i.e. its gradual loss of duration as the securities held in the portfolio mature. Although re-investments of the proceeds from principal payments of the maturing securities can, to a certain extent, offset this endogenous decay of the average portfolio duration – by replacing short-term expiring securities with the purchase of longer-term securities – this substitution effect is generally not strong enough to maintain the average maturity of the portfolio relative to that of the market portfolio at a level consistent with a given amount of accommodation. In addition, of course, the amount of duration that is supplied to the market by public and private issuers is not constant and indeed typically trends up. Thus, keeping the central bank portfolio steady at a certain nominal level means that, in relative terms, the fraction of duration risk that is withdrawn from the market tends to fall. As time passes, the endogenous loss of duration in the central bank portfolio is bound to exert increasing upward pressure on the term premium.  When the Governing Council will eventually judge that the transition to a sustained adjustment is likely to be completed within a medium term horizon with a sufficiently high degree of confidence, this endogenous process will act as a self-correction mechanism. In those conditions, the higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions still attractive even as nominal borrowing costs will tend to rise. From today’s point of view, we are still some distance away from a sustained adjustment. As we concluded at our last monetary policy meeting, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term.  Before drawing to a close, let me address one additional issue related to the calibration of the APP, namely the horizon for executing the purchases.  We have traditionally communicated our (re-)calibrations of the APP in terms of two parameters: the pace of monthly purchases and an intentional end date, which is however always conditional on a sustained adjustment. The two parameters have facilitated market participants’ calculus of the extra stimulus implied by each of our successive rounds of (re-)calibrations: by multiplying pace by the horizon, markets have been able to identify the size of the portfolio which is relevant for pricing the term premium. What we have seen is that, if confronted with a higher monthly pace in exchange for a shorter intentional horizon or, conversely, a lower pace in exchange for a longer intentional horizon, the reaction in the markets has been varying through time. In more tense market conditions, a higher purchase pace in the near term is generally seen as having a higher easing potential. Probably, in conditions in which uncertainty is high, frontloading the accumulation of a given stock of purchases more forcefully signals the central bank’s commitment to inject the degree of accommodation necessary to support the recovery. By contrast, in more normal market conditions, the market’s capacity to engage in intertemporal arbitrage improves. Consequently, investors may become “more patient”, or, in other words, better able to evaluate the stimulus that can be expected to come from a purchase plan that is to be executed over a more extended time interval. Conclusion While the euro area recovery remains solid, broad-based and resilient, the economy has yet to make sufficient progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels that are consistent with the Governing Council’s aim. To support such sustained adjustment the ECB has resorted to a package of complementary policy measures and recalibrated this package at various occasions in line with the evolving macroeconomic conditions, most notably the outlook for price stability, and the state of monetary policy transmission. This autumn the Governing Council will again assess how all these factors can be expected to influence the monetary policy stance and will re-calibrate its instruments accordingly, with a view to delivering the monetary policy impulse that is still necessary to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation in a way that is consistent with our monetary policy aim.

One of the more popular answers is that humans are rational animals – a view that goes back to Aristotle. Let us take that question and adapt it to our world: what does it mean to be a European banking supervisor? The answer is certainly not that banking supervisors are rational bankers. But apart from that, being a European banking supervisor means many things. First of all, it means looking across borders. It means being tough and fair, unbiased by national interests. For us, it means being part of a team of supervisors from 19 countries and 27 institutions. It means working in the public interest – and having an exciting job. But it also means dealing with many challenges at the same time. And it is these challenges I’d like to talk about in my speech. But as there are many and as our time is limited, I have to make a choice. So let me first tell you what I won’t do today. I won’t discuss the bringing together of cultures and languages that are very different. I won’t discuss dealing with banks that struggle to remain profitable. I won’t discuss digitalisation, and I won’t discuss Brexit. Instead, I will focus on three issues: first, the rulebook for banks and how it relates to supervision; second, the toolbox that supervisors have at their disposal; and third, the role of the market. Supervisors and the rulebook A solid rulebook is a cornerstone of a stable banking sector. It ensures that banks acknowledge the risks they take and build up adequate buffers. A solid rulebook lays the foundations for banking supervisors to do their job.  Since the financial crisis, the rulebook for banks has been thoroughly revised. Today, banks face much tougher rules than before. They need to hold higher capital buffers that consist of better capital. At the same time, they need to hold liquidity buffers – for the first time ever. And these are just two of the things that help to make banks more resilient. So the regulatory base has been made more solid. But it needs to be more than solid; it also needs to be level. The rules for banks should, in general, be harmonised across countries. Only then would banks be able to compete on a level playing field. But what’s the scope for harmonisation? Here, we should be bold, in my view. The financial sector is global in scope, and so should be the rules that govern it. And after the crisis, it was precisely this idea that drove the work on a global rulebook: Basel III. But since then, the political landscape has changed. It seems that there are some who have stopped subscribing to the idea of a global approach to regulation. National interests might get the upper hand, and that’s not good. Against that backdrop, we need to finalise Basel III as quickly as possible. But having a global set of standards is just the first step. The second step is for all countries to implement it in a consistent manner. That includes the euro area. Here, a level playing field is even more important, given that we have a single currency and a single market. And there is indeed a single European rulebook. However, when you take a closer look, it turns out that the single rulebook is not so single, after all. So, in fact, we still have a kind of regulatory hotchpotch in Europe. How can that be? Well, one reason is that parts of the single rulebook come in the form of EU Directives. And these directives still have to be transposed into national law. That in turn opens the door for significant differences between countries. One of the many examples relates to what is known as “fit and proper” requirements. Bank directors have to fulfil certain criteria of competence and probity before they can take up their job. However, these criteria differ across the euro area. In some countries, they are quite strict, in others less so. And as the ECB is bound by national law, we cannot provide harmonised supervision in this case. But the patchwork consists of more than that. The rulebook also contains what are known as options and discretions, O&Ds for short. These O&Ds provide governments and supervisors with some leeway in applying the rules. Again, this has led to differences across countries. Here we have made some progress, though. Together with the national supervisors, we have agreed to exercise a number of options and discretions in a harmonised manner. But there are still O&Ds that lie in the hands of governments. So it is up to them to bring about more harmonisation. And I admit that I am quite disappointed that so little has been done in this area. And last but not least, there is a third item that helps to explain Europe’s regulatory mix. We still see that some countries are issuing national laws that affect the core of European banking supervision. There are, for instance, national laws that govern risk management. And these laws apply to banks that are directly supervised by the ECB, of course. Now imagine that there is a banking group with entities in Germany and Spain. This banking group would be subject to different rules when it comes to managing credit risk or to liquidity reporting. Needless to say, this seems ill-suited to a banking union and a level playing field. Now what does this regulatory hotchpotch mean for European banking supervisors? Well, it makes them less effective and less efficient. In the worst case, they have to deal with 19 national rules instead of a single European one. This makes it hard to treat banks equally. It leads to more bureaucracy and higher costs. It opens the door to regulatory arbitrage, and it distorts competition. My advice is therefore clear: we must further harmonise the rulebook. Instead of EU Directives, we should rely more on EU Regulations, which can be directly applied in all Member States. We should deal with the remaining O&Ds, and we should stop passing more and more national laws, especially those which apply to banks that are supervised at European level. Instead, we should strive to cut down on some of these national laws, such as those concerning the reporting requirements that have become redundant as a result of the European Reporting Framework. Scrapping such laws would increase efficiency and reduce costs for both banks and supervisors. So supervisors need a strong and level regulatory base. However, we must be careful that it does not turn into a cage. How could that happen? How could the rulebook evolve in a way that would confine supervisors? The problem here is “too much detail”, a kind of regulatory “overload” – involving too many stakeholders and too much bureaucracy. There is a tendency to add more and more details to the rulebook. This is driven by a desire to have rules that cover every eventuality. Whatever happens, there should be a rule to deal with it. It would trigger supervisory action. And if it didn’t exist, well, then there’s no trigger and no action. However, trying to have a rule for every eventuality is an elusive goal, of course. The business of banking is so complex and fast-changing that no rulebook would be able to fully cover it. The unexpected will always happen. If not by chance, then because banks make it happen on purpose. And precisely that is one of the problems entailed by an overly detailed rulebook: regulatory arbitrage. The more detailed the rules, the more ways banks can game them. This creates new risks, which are then not covered by the rules. On top of that, an overly detailed rulebook would make it much more difficult for supervisors to react decisively and quickly to a changing environment. Supervising a bank could turn into a mere box-ticking exercise. And supervisors would turn into experts for tiny details; they could end up focusing on the minutiae and forgetting the big picture. And that would be a waste. It would be a waste of all the experience, expertise and insights that supervisors have. Why not strengthen their judgement? Why not keep the flexibility they need to react to newly emerging risks in an ever-changing banking sector? And do all that within a sensible legal framework, of course. At the end of the day, we need both. We need clear-cut rules, and we need sound supervisory judgement. Adding more and more details to the rules might come at the expense of supervisory judgement. With the recent reforms we have struck a balance in this regard. If we were to upset this balance, it would become much harder to ensure that banks remain safe and sound. Supervisors and their toolbox But European banking supervisors need more than an adequate rulebook to do their job. They also need the right tools, of course. They need a European toolbox. And here, a lot has been done. We have harmonised the main tool of banking supervision: the supervisory review and evaluation process, SREP for short. In the SREP we take a very close look at each bank. We analyse its business model, its governance, its risk management as well as risks to its capital and liquidity positions. The SREP provides a common yardstick to compare banks across the euro area. It helps us to identify best practices and spot common problems. By referring to the SREP, we develop specific supervisory requirements and measures for each bank. And by the way, supervisory judgement plays a big role in the SREP. But the SREP is a massive tool, and we still need to refine it. Let me give you an example. As part of the SREP, we review the processes that banks use to assess and maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers. These processes are known as ICAAP and ILAAP[1]. Based on what we learnt from our SREP exercises, we will refine our expectations regarding ICAAP and ILAAP, and our methods for reviewing them. And we also need to consider how best to assess the risk management of banks in the SREP. We need to do more than just define what we expect with regard to the management of IT risks, outsourcing or leveraged finance. We need to define fully fledged minimum expectations for the risk management of banks.  But our toolbox comprises more than the SREP. So there are other things that we need to improve. First, there are tools that are applied in different ways in different countries. On-site inspections at banks are one example. In some countries, the preparation takes some time, while the actual inspection is quite short. In other countries, it is the other way round. This makes it difficult to coordinate and to create international teams of on-site inspectors. Second, there are tools which exist in some countries but not in others. In this regard, the moratorium tool comes first to mind. It allows supervisors to suspend all the activities of a failing bank for a short period of time. It helps to handle such failures in a timely and orderly manner. Therefore, moratorium powers should be part of the European toolbox. Another tool that we need to have is called “deductions from own funds”. It would help to ensure that banks make adequate provision for risks – adequate from a prudential point of view. The national accounting frameworks allow for some flexibility with regard to provisioning. And what a bank then chooses may not be sufficient from the supervisors’ viewpoint, taking into account the bank’s risk profile. That’s why supervisors should be able to impose prudential deductions from own funds. And third, there are some tools which are part of the European toolbox not once but twice. And this can cause problems. A relevant case relates to banks that get into trouble and the question of how to intervene as early as possible. As a rule of thumb, banks don’t get into trouble out of the blue. Rather, it is a gradual downfall in most cases. Thus, we have tools at our disposal that allow us to step in early and send warning signals to the banks. This is known as early intervention. However, the relevant tools are the same as some of our standard tools. And this overlap might prevent us from using early intervention tools. The reason is that we are bound to use the least intrusive tool, which is always the standard one. This is particularly relevant should the market authorities demand that the bank disclose whether early intervention tools have been deployed. So, the overlap between early intervention tools and standard tools should be removed. To sum up, we still need to work on the toolbox of European banking supervisors. We have to expand, harmonise and streamline it. Supervisors and the market Now let us come back to my initial question. Being a European banking supervisor means doing an important job. Equipped with an adequate rulebook and the necessary tools, supervisors help to make banks safe and sound. Such banks in turn form the foundations of a strong economy. But we should not become too self-centred. Banks are private enterprises, and the banking sector is a market, after all. As such, it deploys forces that can help to keep risks in check and secure stability. There were even times when many believed that market forces alone could bring about a stable and efficient banking sector, ensure sustainable business models and make banks resilient to the ups and downs of the economy. That belief was shattered by the crisis. But don’t get me wrong. I believe in the market; in theory, the forces of the market work fine. The problem is just that, in practice, they do not always work so well, for several reasons. First of all, the market is made by people interacting, and people have their limits. Ample research shows that human brains are not very good at handling risk. We tend to over- or underestimate it; we tend to get carried away by potential gains; and we tend to overreact when things change. And then, people’s behaviour depends on incentives which are sometimes distorted. The most prominent example is this: whenever you can keep the gains but pass potential losses on to someone else, you might be tempted to take on too much risk. So, in practice, the market has its shortcomings. But is that a reason to do away with it? No, not at all. We should try to make it work. For the banking sector, this means aligning incentives. And as I just mentioned, the best incentive to keep risks in check is potential failure and financial loss. As the economist Allan Meltzer noted: “Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn’t work.” But in banking, there was a lack of failure. During the crisis, many banks that should have failed did not fail. Instead, governments propped them up with public funds – at huge cost to taxpayers. They did so out of fear of a systemic crisis. They were worried that when a large bank fails, it would drag others down and destroy the entire system. So there was a situation where banks could pass on any losses to someone else while keeping any profits. They had an incentive to gamble with other people’s money. So, we need to make it possible for banks to fail without causing the whole system to collapse. And we need to make sure that profit-makers are also loss-takers. That would align incentives, strengthen market discipline and keep risk-taking in check. In Europe, we now have a new system for exactly that purpose: the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM for short. The SRM provides the tools to resolve banks in an orderly manner. Earlier this year, it passed its first test when a couple of banks failed. This was a huge step towards imposing market discipline on banks and making them safer and sounder. And I can confirm that dealing with a failed bank is among the most complex things you can do as a supervisor. The first step is that the ECB declares the bank failing or likely to fail. And that, in itself, is a delicate matter. A bank can fail for a million reasons. Sometimes it is a slow death that drags on over weeks and weeks. Sometimes it all happens within a couple of days. In the end, it is up to the ECB to decide whether the moment has come, and that is a decision which cannot be taken lightly. Taking it too early might infringe the rights of investors and creditors. Taking it too late might lead to a systemic crisis; it might harm the economy and society. So all in all it is a decision that requires supervisors to carefully judge the case at hand. Once the ECB has declared a bank failing or likely to fail, another body takes over: the Single Resolution Board, SRB for short. It is the SRB that decides how to deal with the bank. In a nutshell, this is how we handle failing banks in Europe. Once you start looking at the details, it becomes much more complex, of course. It requires all parties involved to closely cooperate. And it requires all parties, including the banks, to be well prepared. That’s why it is so important for banks to carefully draft their recovery and resolution plans. But as I said, recent experience has shown that our approach works. The ECB, the SRB, the European Commission and the relevant national authorities proved that they can cooperate closely. They have demonstrated that they can deal with failing banks and handle the whole process smoothly. That said, things can and should be improved, of course. And I am not just thinking of the actual failure of a bank. I am also thinking of what can be done before it comes to that. And here, we need to think about precautionary recapitalisation, for instance. Under very strict conditions, the European rules on state aid allow banks to be given public funds. However, these aid rules might need an update that would align them with the new European resolution regime. In this context, we also need to reflect again on how we define solvency. After all, banks need to be solvent in order to receive precautionary recapitalisation. Here, we need to reach a common understanding of how to define solvency, in particular its forward-looking aspect. As for the banks, they need to reflect on how to handle their liquidity during a crisis. Most importantly, they need to make sure that they have a backstop in place that is readily accessible. And then, when push comes to shove, we need to improve the tools that are needed to actually resolve a bank. I already mentioned that some tools still need to be added to the European toolbox. The moratorium is one of them. And finally, we must keep in mind that only systemically relevant banks will be resolved at European level. All other banks will be subject to national insolvency regimes. It might thus be warranted to harmonise these regimes across Europe to ensure a level playing field. All the things I just mentioned will have an impact on how supervisors assess and react to the risks of banks and the risks of bank failures. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, What does it mean to be a European banking supervisor? That was one of my questions at the outset. And the answer was that it means many things. It is a job that is challenging and rewarding at the same time. Today I have mostly talked about the challenges. I have talked about the need to write a solid and harmonised rulebook. I have talked about the need to expand, harmonise and streamline the supervisory toolbox. And I have talked about how to make the market work again. To end on a more positive note, let us turn to the rewarding aspects of being a European banking supervisor. Above all, it means being part of a united Europe. It means working towards a stable and truly European banking sector – a banking sector that spans 19 countries and serves more than 300 million people. And all these people rely on banks. They rely on banks to invest their savings, to help them start a business or buy a home. It is the job of a European banking supervisor to contribute to a stable banking system that can reliably and efficiently serve these needs. Thank you for your attention.

A year ago, we were discussing together the moderate pace of the recovery in the euro area. We were witnessing a slight loss of momentum and assessing the impact of the UK referendum. Over the past 12 months, however, the recovery has accelerated and broadened, supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy.  In my remarks today I will discuss the current economic outlook and the impact of our monetary policy measures. At the request of the committee, I will focus in particular on two topics related to the ECB’s monetary policy, namely the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and monetary policy implementation across the euro area. The economic and inflation outlook The economic expansion is now firm and broad-based across euro area countries and sectors. Real GDP growth was better than expected in the first half of 2017, coming in at 2.3%, year on year, in the second quarter. The euro area economy has enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters of growth, and the latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.  The ongoing recovery is, crucially, driven by domestic forces, and the labour market has notably improved. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in eight years. The number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7\\xa0million since mid-2013. These employment gains, together with increasing household wealth, are supporting the private consumption outlook. Moreover, investment is improving, buoyed by very favourable financing conditions.  The domestic drivers are making the recovery more robust and resilient to adverse external influences. According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon. Annual real GDP is projected to increase by 2.2% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced. At the same time, downside risks continue to exist, mainly related to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics. As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared. Nevertheless, measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months. Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component. Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections. Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise. Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook. Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.  We therefore need to be patient and persistent. An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack. This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation.  With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability. The corporate sector purchase programme The package of monetary policy measures that we have phased in sequentially since June 2014 has led to a significant easing in financing conditions. What is very apparent today, and very difficult to dispute, is that this monetary policy impetus is increasingly leading to stronger economic activity, higher incomes and better employment prospects for people in the euro area.  One key factor has been our ability to activate non-standard instruments that can transmit additional stimulus to the productive sector. In fact, transmission through the banking system has become increasingly effective since we began adopting credit-easing measures. I am referring here specifically to the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), but a similar case can be made for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.  At the request of the committee, let me focus on one component of the APP, namely the CSPP.  Together with the purchase of asset-backed securities and covered bonds, the CSPP represents an important credit-easing component of the APP. By directly lowering the market-based financing costs of non-financial corporations, it boosts the pass-through of our monetary policy.  Under the CSPP, the Eurosystem has since June 2016 purchased bonds issued by a wide range of non-bank corporations established in the euro area, which include large, as well as some smaller, companies. So far, close to €110 billion of corporate bonds from around 200 issuers, in 20 countries, across all sectors, have been purchased. This information is available on our website and in our publications, and is updated regularly. We continue to analyse possibilities for sharing more information, to the extent that it can enhance transparency without undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy. Thanks to our corporate bond purchases, firms in the euro area have witnessed significant improvements in their financing conditions when issuing bonds.  But these improvements in financing conditions stemming from the CSPP are not confined to the companies whose bonds are purchased or to the corporate bond market: they are evident across firms and other market segments.  For example, the yield spreads of high-rated corporate bonds that are not eligible for purchase – namely those issued by financial corporations – have fallen by as much as those of eligible bonds issued by non-financial corporations (almost 70 basis points, from 1.25% in March 2016 to 0.57%) since the CSPP announcement. Spreads of non-investment grade corporate bonds, which are not eligible for the CSPP, have also declined by 262 basis points, from 5.59% in March 2016 to 2.97%.[1]  For asset purchases to boost activity and inflation, however, these improvements in financial markets need to be passed through into credit conditions for the real economy.  In this regard, we have seen very favourable spillovers into credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises. As more corporations seek market-based financing, given the attractive funding conditions prevailing in the capital markets, banks are left with greater capacity to provide loans to smaller companies, which are more constrained in terms of access to funding sources. Hence, bank lending rates on very small loans to non-financial corporations have declined by around 50 basis points since the CSPP announcement. Looking at our latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, smaller companies are indeed reporting improved financing conditions and better access to finance.  The CSPP, therefore, has strengthened the pass-through of our asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy and has contributed to the overall monetary stimulus needed to bring inflation rates back in line with our inflation aim. Conducting monetary policy in the euro area The supportive impact of our policy measures – including all elements of our asset purchase programme – on financing conditions is therefore evident across firms regardless of their size. It is also evident across sectors and across euro area countries. In other words, we are seeing a smooth transmission of our single monetary policy.  A single currency entails a single monetary policy. Hence, the Governing Council takes decisions to achieve the primary objective of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole. It also establishes the necessary guidelines for their implementation. At the same time, and in accordance with its Statute,[2] the ECB has recourse to the national central banks (NCBs) to the extent deemed possible and appropriate for carrying out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem. NCBs in turn have a duty to act in accordance with the guidelines and instructions of the ECB.[3]  This decentralised approach takes into consideration the financial structure of the euro area, i.e. a monetary union made up of segmented national financial markets. In such an environment, the close interaction of NCBs with the banks operating in their jurisdiction brings benefits for the implementation of monetary policy. For example, we are able to collect precise information from a wide range of local counterparties, which can be integrated into the harmonised and rich information set that the Governing Council needs to design policy. Moreover, NCBs, knowing well the specificities of their jurisdictions, are well placed to manage assets to be used as collateral in our operations.  This makes our decentralised system more efficient than a centralised approach under the current circumstances. In the absence of a truly single market for capital, securities markets still depend very much on national specificities and preferences. A successful capital markets union would abolish dividing lines between jurisdictions, with positive effects on the way we implement our monetary policy. In the end, we should not forget that a fundamental reason for monetary union was precisely to foster more integrated capital markets and reap the benefits in the form of improved financing conditions across the euro area. Conclusion Since you asked me to elaborate on the issue of decentralisation, let me conclude with a final thought in this respect and in particular on the implications for the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. The fact that the ECB’s non-standard policy measures have been very effective in supporting the financing conditions of companies and households throughout the euro area should not make us forget the situation we witnessed at the peak of the crisis. For example, institutional weaknesses, structural fragilities and excessive risk-taking contributed to a negative feedback loop between sovereigns and banks in some countries, which significantly impaired monetary policy transmission. The resultant contraction in the euro area economy threatened price stability, our primary objective. Overcoming this vicious circle required considerable effort. The pattern is now running in reverse, with positive spillovers from all countries. They all have benefited from our measures supporting growth across all of the euro area and thus laying the ground for a sustained return of inflation to levels in line with our aim.  But while a cyclical adjustment has been taking place, there are still structural issues which impede sustainable economic convergence.  In the years to come, a higher degree of sustained convergence and strengthened resilience will be necessary in order to achieve a better-functioning Economic and Monetary Union. This requires, on the one hand, policy actions by national governments aimed at unlocking the productive potential of our economies. On the other hand, further decisive steps are needed to make Economic and Monetary Union’s economic governance truly fit for purpose. Thank you for your attention.

I am delighted to see central bank risk managers, practitioners and academics here in Lisbon to exchange views on risk management for central banks. This topic has gained such importance in recent years as central banks across the globe, including the ECB, have sharply expanded their balance sheets, even though the time for ever more of the same is behind us. Like the many great maritime expeditions that started out from this country, some of our endeavours in recent years have taken us into uncharted territory. Now is a good time to take stock of what we have learnt and map out what may come next. Following stable principles in the Eurosystem’s risk management framework  The Eurosystem has a clearly defined objective, enshrined in the Treaty, to preserve price stability in the euro area.[1] The Treaty does not speak of eligible counterparties, collateral haircuts or issue share limits for bond purchases. However, you would be mistaken in assuming that managing financial risks has no role in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy implementation – especially in the light of the significant balance sheet expansion over the past few years. On the contrary, we have applied the guiding principles of our financial risk management framework in a stable manner. We established these principles long before we embarked on non-conventional policies, not least because we have a statutory obligation to lend only against adequate collateral. We continue to apply them to standard as well as non-standard policy measures.  Broadly speaking, these principles are protection, consistency, simplicity and transparency. This means that – if multiple monetary policy options exist to fulfil our mandate – we should select the measures that minimise our own exposure to financial risks. This idea is sometimes referred to as risk efficiency. These principles also imply that we aim to avoid undue distortions in the markets in which we operate. We trade at market prices and we adopt a risk-equivalent approach in setting our risk control measures. In addition, the principles require risk management to be an integral part of decision-making in the institution. So we are compelled to measure risk in an objective and consistent way across different types of operation. Lastly, our frameworks promote transparency and simplicity, and we champion adherence to these principles by being rules-based ourselves and as predictable as possible in our operations. We have come together here to discuss risk management for central banks and the lessons from the crisis. But, in addition to looking back, I would like to take this opportunity to map out some fundamental elements that should be part of the future risk management framework, once we have returned to a more conventional monetary policy environment. Of course, these are largely informed by some of the actions we took over the past decade and founded on the principles I have just described. So while we are clearly not in a position to move to this new steady state in one go, its broad features can already be seen today. Navigating through gusts, storms and crosswinds  Risk managers, including central bank risk managers, are generally prudent. Such prudence is not only necessary to preserve market confidence in the central bank’s independence and ability to comply with its mandate, it is also appropriate since we are entrusted with public money. In a crisis, however, the central bank’s exposure to financial risks can – and may indeed have to – increase, because it is still expected to fulfil its policy mandate. The non-conventional measures that we implemented were necessary and proportionate to achieve our mandate; they have also contributed to financial stability by reducing financial risks in the euro area. There are, of course, limits to the actions of central banks, as monetary policy cannot address structural or fiscal sources of financial distress, nor can it step in to rectify national deficiencies as our mandate applies to the euro area as a whole. It is important for central banks to strike the right balance in this regard, and for financial risks to be correctly measured, properly understood and sufficiently contained. Moreover, the European Court of Justice, in its judgment on outright monetary transactions, has confirmed the need to provide sufficient risk management measures that are “likely to reduce the risk of losses to which the ECB is exposed”. Speaking in a country with a proud history of maritime exploration let me recall the words of Seneca, the Younger: When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind. The “harbour” of a central bank is its mandate. The principles it seeks to adhere to are the “compass” that helps it fulfil this mandate. When a central bank is facing a crisis, it needs to consider whether its monetary policy operations are still proportionate. This need stems from the obligation under primary law (proportionality principle) to properly weigh up all the components of a given measure against one another. The aim is to determine whether the expected benefits of the measure outweigh its costs. As a general rule, a stable risk management approach and a through-the-cycle approach are advisable. However, extraordinary circumstances may require extensions of the framework, such as the acceptance of additional collateral. If this still proves insufficient, unprecedented types of monetary policy measures may call for entirely new operations, accompanied by new risk management measures.  The evolution of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations in response to the crisis featured all these activities. Our risk management framework has evolved accordingly, guided by our stable principles. First, the “gusty winds”: during the early stages of the financial crisis, we increased the amount of liquidity we provided to the banking system without tightening the risk control framework, despite the onset of stress in the system. In this respect, our risk management framework followed a through-the-cycle approach – thereby avoiding further distress to the banking system. It also stood in stark contrast to the more pro-cyclical nature of the commercial banking sector’s risk management approach – and was thus part of the central bank’s duty to lean against such potentially self-reinforcing winds. It was possible to avoid tightening the framework without exposing the Eurosystem to undue risks because the pre-crisis framework had been calibrated in a sufficiently prudent manner. In fact, the framework proved to be robust enough to protect the Eurosystem from losses resulting from counterparties defaulting, such as Lehman Brothers or the Icelandic banks – although the complexity of the collateral in some of these cases led to lengthy liquidation processes. This experience certainly merited a careful review of the collateral rules for complex securities and financial innovations. More broadly, it justified taking steps towards reducing the reliance on external credit ratings, in line with the G20 agenda. Second, the “storm broke out”: after the default of Lehman Brothers, it became evident that such standard measures were no longer sufficient to achieve price stability in the euro area. We therefore provided enhanced credit support and, later on, non-standard credit operations in the light of the increased liquidity demands from the banking system. To avoid potential collateral shortages when satisfying this increased demand, we expanded the range of assets against which banks can draw liquidity from the Eurosystem. But at the same time, we followed the principle of risk equivalence with the assets accepted under the pre-crisis rules. Let me give you a concrete example: since 2012, several national central banks of the euro area, including the one hosting this conference, have accepted additional bank loans as collateral. To ensure risk equivalence, haircuts on these assets were higher than those used in regular operations.  This brings me to the third phase of the crisis, the “crosswinds”: in recent years the continued decline in inflation rates in the euro area called for additional non-standard measures – I am referring, of course, to the asset purchase programmes. This type of liquidity provision was a novelty for the Eurosystem, although the instrument of outright purchases has been envisaged as one of the legal and operational tools of the Eurosystem since its inception. Accordingly, additional risk control frameworks needed to be developed to keep the financial risks in check given the significant rise in exposures.  Our Asset Purchase Program, especially the PSPP, its largest component, is a case in point: the Eurosystem applies strict eligibility requirements. Purchases are subject to issuer and issue limits. We closely monitor the risks of the programme in place and any possible deviations from the benchmarks, e.g. in the CBPP3. Our due diligence can, under very strict conditions, lead to purchases of covered bonds that credit rating agencies rate below our regular eligibility threshold. On the other hand, our due diligence can also lead to additional risk control measures for particularly risky covered bonds. Given that we have not suffered any impairment since we started the expanded asset purchase programmes, I feel justified in saying that the financial risks have been successfully contained so far. Maintaining the risk management principles while returning to a more conventional monetary policy  It is clear that, once we have seen a sufficiently sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we will continue to prudently adjust our tool-box of monetary policy instruments, as we have been doing since December last year. This will also be the moment when we have to carefully review how our operational and risk management framework has deviated from its pre-crisis state. Where necessary, some temporary measures will be rolled back. But we will also consider whether there are areas where we have taken new risks onto our balance sheet – and consequently where certain elements should be kept.  The developments I have just described offer some insights into how the future steady state risk management framework might look. At the moment, I see four key features: First, while the temporary collateral framework has successfully eased potential collateral shortages, it could be argued that it should not become part of the regular framework. As liquidity demand declines, there will also be less need for an expanded set of eligible collateral. Whether some temporary measures might be transformed into a state-contingent framework, ready to be activated again in the future if circumstances so require, is an open question. As experience shows, each crisis needs a tailored response. Second, we will need to keep the flexibility to adjust the collateral framework to financial innovations, especially when it comes to complex new financial products. The new “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation regulation is a case in point. It will allow us to better assess the collateral we accept. In a similar way, we will need to forcefully deal with new types of securities, such as conditional pass-through covered bonds, whose risks may not yet have been fully appreciated. Third, we will have to retain the risk control frameworks for the asset purchase programmes beyond the horizon of our net asset purchases. As long as we keep outright portfolios on our balance sheet, the reasons behind the risk control measures, including eligibility criteria, purchase limits, benchmarks ensuring diversification and the different risk-sharing agreements, will continue to apply. Fourth, the Governing Council will have to decide whether we ought to rely more on our own judgement about the quality of assets and counterparties and to further expand Eurosystem-internal credit assessment systems, steps which would require additional resources. It means further enhancing the due diligence on external credit ratings, for which sufficient transparency on the judgement underlying these ratings is essential. And it means using supervisory information to ensure an efficient implementation of monetary policy operations – the introduction of the European single supervisory mechanism has brought about fundamental improvements here, as it allows for the sharing of relevant information within the legal limits of the separation principle. To conclude, I believe the Eurosystem’s risk management framework has successfully weathered the financial storms of the past few years. The reason is that we followed stable principles when the size of our operations, the assets accepted as collateral or the types of operations changed. Looking ahead, we can already start thinking about a financial risk management framework that will be appropriate for a central bank that has returned to a more conventional environment for the conduct of monetary policy, while still following these principles. I now look forward to the panel discussions, which will pick up on some of those issues in more detail, and to hearing your views.      [1] Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.     ']\n",
      "['2017-09-25', 'Vítor Constâncio', 'Developing models for policy analysis in central banks', 'Opening speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Annual Research Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 25-26 September 2017', '  Developing models for policy analysis in central banks   Opening speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Annual Research Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 25-26 September 2017 I am pleased to welcome you to the second Annual Research Conference of the European Central Bank. Every year this aims to be our flagship research event, bringing together academics and central bank researchers working at the cutting edge of economics.  We value research because it contributes to shape the intellectual framework that we use to understand economic developments and to take policy decisions. We are especially keen to keep abreast of new developments in the research frontier because they are on top of the new challenges to understand the economy´s behaviour which is vital for devising appropriate policies. In the words of Christiano, the Great Recession was a macroeconomics earthquake [1] to which the field is still adjusting. Christiano highlights mainly three aspects: the need to recuperate the Keynesian view that demand shocks and the paradox-of-thrift can be important for economic performance, the notion that economy is not quickly self-correcting and requires public policies intervention and, finally, that the financial sector can endogenously generate imbalances with significant consequences for the real economy. With hindsight, it is surprising how these points were neglected by mainstream economics for so long. Many other aspects can be usefully added to that list.  First, that stabilisation policies are crucial and that not only growth counts as significant fluctuations leave behind permanent losses. Related to this, is the the notion that demand shocks can affect the supply side via hysteresis effects in labour supply and the capital stock via investment deceleration. The distinction between short- and long-term is necessary for theorising and teaching, but often is not useful for policy analysis models.  Second, the heterogeneity of agents, particularly of consumers, is important to understand aggregate behaviour, in view of indebtness, credit restrictions and income and wealth composition.  Third, behavioural economics has also cast doubt on the full rational expectations paradigm as a too demanding hypothesis about the cognitive powers of economic agents, especially for long horizons. In this context, the myopic assumption explored by Gabaix (2017)[2] is a welcomed development.  Fourth, agents’ heterogeneity relates to the issue of distribution that had been neglected but which, with the use of Heterogenous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models, helped bring to the fore as exemplified by the recent contribution of Ahn et al. (2017) at the NBER Macroeconomics Annual Conference.[3] It shows how significant the feedback loop is and how models with realistic household heterogeneity fit empirical consumption dynamics better.  Fifth, the assumption of a unique steady state is now challenged by the consideration of multiple equilibria, particularly some without full employment as seen in the work by Farmer and collaborators[4]. The idea of abandoning the notion of an aprioristic theoretical equilibria in favour of the pure interaction of heterogeneous agents with behaviour rules in ABMs (Agent Based Models) is more controversial. A final point refers to the question whether conventional monetary policy is as powerful as portrayed in mainstream DSGE models via Euler equations. The protracted recovery seems to give ground to the old view of monetary policy effectiveness being asymmetric and weaker in recessions. There is justification for rethinking a more active role for fiscal policy, following the recent papers by Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2017)[5]. A reconsideration of the effectiveness of both macro policies has become even more necessary in view of the two major problems that central banks are now confronted with: first, the lingering low inflation associated with flatter Phillips curves that impairs the policy transmission and, second, the need for policy instruments to deal with the next recession, even if a mild one. The various points I just listed are some of the relevant aspects of the on-going revision of macroeconomics and justify the point recently made by Blanchard that we need different types of models to understand, forecast and analyse the economy and the policies necessary to address its shortcomings. In that spirit, I will concentrate my remaining remarks on some on-going developments in the specification of macroeconomic models at the ECB.  Desirable properties of policy models Macroeconomic models can be used for a variety of purposes in central banks. They are helpful to articulate relationships between certain variables of interest in a systematic fashion, while ensuring that resource constraints are respected. They provide input to the complex process of macroeconomic forecasting. And they can be helpful to conduct scenario analyses and study policy counterfactuals.  To perform these tasks effectively, a model should satisfy two simple criteria. First, since many policy questions are inherently quantitative in nature, a useful model must fit the data reasonably well and should be able to produce effective economic forecasts. Model-based counterfactual analyses will only serve as a credible benchmark for policy discussion, if the results are quantitatively plausible. In practice, this criterion has two implications. On the one hand, the model should incorporate realistic elasticities. For example, the dynamic effects of changes in monetary policy interest rates should be consistent with available reduced-form evidence. In the euro area, the model should provide a reasonably good account of the inflationary impact of national fiscal expansions, or of developments in national wage negotiations. On the other hand, the model should provide a credible narrative for observed economic developments.  The second criterion is really an implication of the first. Partly due to new research findings, partly as a result of puzzling economic developments, we constantly update our beliefs on the key economic mechanisms that are necessary to fit the data. The model should be reasonably flexible to be able to adapt to a changing economic and policy environment and to speak to current policy questions. The financial crisis is a case in point. The macroeconomic models maintained by central banks in the early 2000s were not equipped to speak to all the questions arising in the aftermath of the crisis without further adjustments. From today’s standpoint, these adjustments are simply inescapable. We would like the model to provide a reasonable account of the dynamic effects of non-standard monetary policy measures. With policy rates at the effective lower bound, we really need the model to provide realistic implications on the impact of forward guidance. For me as a policymaker, it is of key importance that our models can be adapted fast enough to address newly emerging questions in a timely manner. Of course, in order to reap the benefits of a flexible modelling framework, it is equally important to have expert staff using and enhancing the models in a practical and innovative manner.  The new ECB multi-country model: ECB-MC These considerations played an important role at the ECB, when we were just recently faced with the decision of enhancing the multi-country (MC) model of the euro area. Which paradigm should we adopt?  One option was to remain within the DSGE framework. For over 10 years, DSGE models have been the key tool used for policy analysis exercises in many central banks. This has also been the case at the ECB, where the initial development of estimated DSGE models has taken place.[6] DSGE models are typically estimated and thus consistent with the data. They often reproduce the dynamic effects of changes in monetary policy interest rates that are observed in identified Variable Autoregression Models (VARs.) This is also the case for the DSGE model developed in the Directorate General Research, the New Area-Wide Model, is regularly used for counterfactual policy analysis.[7]  At the same time, a good fit of the data is to some extent accomplished by DSGE models through persistent shock processes, which questions the empirical validity of the model’s intrinsic propagation mechanisms. More importantly, DSGE models do not always provide a plausible story for observed economic developments. For example, so-called “technology shocks” tend to play an overwhelmingly important role in accounting for the evolution of GDP, even when external data do not show any evidence of technological innovations. Moreover, DSGE models can only slowly be adapted to a new policy environment. The requirement of full internal consistency makes the incorporation of new features--be it a more granular financial sector, household heterogeneity or stronger nonlinearities--often very demanding. Enhancements come with long gestation periods, sometimes limiting the ability of DSGE models to speak to newly emerging policy questions, in a timely manner.  In designing the new ECB-MC we have therefore started from the premise that, in the words of Olivier Blanchard, “policy models” cannot be expected to have the same tight structure as “theory models”.[8] We have decided to adopt a semi-structural approach inspired by two guidelines: 1) include financial frictions or financial mechanisms that could allow monetary policy shocks to be transmitted via channels that were absent before the crisis; 2) adopt a more flexible and empirically-driven approach.  The emphasis is on equation-by-equation fit, while the cross-equation constraints are mostly ignored because they do not impinge on the model’s ability to provide sound quantitative predictions. When introducing financial frictions, we have relied on a reduced form representation that is consistent with different theoretical micro-foundations. This more flexible, semi-structural approach allows us to model a wide range of banking and financial variables, going from bank lending spreads to term premia, without taking a stance on the exact theoretical mechanism linking them to the macroeconomy.  At its core, the new ECB-MC model is designed along the lines of the Federal Reserve’s FRB/US model.[9] The behavioural decision rules of private agents are based on optimisation and in the long run the model boils down to a neoclassical growth model. In the short run, however, it is assumed that agents face adjustment costs which imply staggered adjustment of the actual to the desired levels.  Challenges ahead I believe the design of the ECB- MC model will increase the robustness of our model-based policy analyses and strengthen our capability to address newly emerging policy questions in a timely manner. The model development, which has been led by the Directorate General Research, is a joint effort of economists from a wide-range of policy areas inside the ECB, colleagues from national central banks and academic consultants. I am confident it will soon be part of the ECB toolkit. However, it is easy to forecast that further refinements will prove to be necessary in the future, for the model to continue being a valuable policy tool. I specifically see four areas where significant progress has already been made, but further improvements are likely to be necessary. The first area is related to the modelling of aggregate consumption. I share the concern of Muellbauer that the standard DSGE framework imposes unrealistic micro-foundations for the behaviour of households as embodied in the ‘rational expectations permanent income’ model of consumption.[10] In typical representative-agent models, consumption behaviour is captured by an Euler equation, an inter-temporal optimality condition that links today’s level of consumption to expected consumption in the next period and further into the future. In its linearised form, it does neither envisage that consumers face idiosyncratic (household-specific) and uninsurable income uncertainty, nor that uncertainty interacts with credit or liquidity constraints. This is in stark contrast to recent research that emphasises the importance of precautionary saving, liquidity constraints, leverage and of heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in marginal propensities to consume.[11] Compared to simple representative-agent models, the ECB-MC clearly marks an improvement. The consumption function is explicitly affected by agents’ wealth holdings. [12] Agents have shorter average horizons than presumed under the text-book permanent income hypothesis and the model further allows for the presence of agents that do not optimize but rather exhibit ‘hand-to-mouth’ behaviour. Last, but not least, risk aversion and income uncertainty also play a role for consumption behaviour. This setup, for example, allows quantifying how larger income uncertainty reduces the power of forward guidance. All in all, I think that we are moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, the modelling of aggregate consumption is an area in which research is currently developing fast and we should be ready to learn from new findings.  The second area of improvement concerns the modelling of expectations. As Sargent (1993) emphasizes, rational expectations can be a meaningful characterisation of the long-run equilibrium, but the transition to a new steady state might display non-rational behaviour. [13] An increasing body of research aims to explore the implications of alternative types of departures from rational expectations for business cycle dynamics in general, and the transmission of monetary policy in particular, as in the papers by Garcia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015), Gabaix (2017) or Fahri and Werning.[14] Once again, the ECB-MC goes in the right direction. The model can be simulated under two expectation setups: (i) in a model consistent manner, and (ii) under the assumption of bounded rationality where agents form expectations with a small-scale VAR model. Other expectation formation mechanisms, such as learning or the use of market expectations, are also easily implementable. As was shown by Blanchard and co-authors in a recent study on the macroeconomic effects of changes in the expectations of long-run productivity growth, different assumptions on the expectation formation mechanism can lead to considerably different outcomes.[15] Assessing the most realistic way of treating expectations in policy models remains a crucial area for further work. The third area of improvement has to do with the nexus between inflation, wages and the real economy. When modelled through the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, the nexus seems to have become weaker after the financial crisis.[16] Commentators have repeatedly talked about a “missing disinflation” at the trough of the Great Recession, and about “missing inflation” in more recent years.[17] Recent studies have come up with alternative explanations for these phenomena. For instance, the “missing disinflation” has been argued to be the consequence of either the presence of well-anchored inflation expectations[18], increased downward wage rigidities in recessions[19], or a fall in total factor productivity and increased costs of working capital[20]. Understanding the underlying sources of this apparent structural change will be important for monetary policy. The semi-reduced-form nature of the ECB-MC makes it ill-equipped to address this deep question, but studying structural changes is challenging for all current models built to study cyclical developments.  The fourth and final area where further improvements are necessary is macro-financial linkages. I have already mentioned that the ECB-MC incorporates such linkages. Nevertheless, the exact way in which they affect the monetary policy transmission mechanism remains imperfectly understood, even if the empirical literature is making important advances.[21] These linkages are also relevant for financial stability and may evolve in response to the recent reforms in the regulatory environment. This is why at the ECB we are also making parallel progress on this front within the DSGE paradigm, through the 3D model. The 3D model has been developed under the macroprudential research (MaRS) network, and can be used to assess the macroeconomic benefits and costs of macroprudential policies. “3D” alludes to the fact that, contrary to previous models, it captures the distinct benefits of capital requirements through reductions in default risk in the economy, not only for banks but also for borrowers, i.e. non-financial firms and households.[22]  Concluding remarks To conclude, building models for policy analysis is associated with trade-offs. This is an important reason for central banks to not rely on a single model and a single modelling paradigm, but to make use of a suite of models based on different paradigms. I could not agree more with Blanchard who recently expressed his view that also other types of general equilibrium models beyond DSGEs are useful policy tools.[23] I am pleased this view has been getting more traction lately, as alternative types of models will continue to be part of central banks’ toolbox. Development of those models can greatly benefit from insights from academic research, so I am very much looking forward to the contributions to be presented at this conference.

Introduction: Systemic risks in the non-bank sector Assessing the impact of a large shock on financial soundness of non-bank financial institutions, stress testing can improve measurement of the risks and can help in the calibration of instruments mitigating those risks. There is a need to further develop these policy tools while at the same time adaptation of stress test models towards integrating different agents into a system-wide tool is important. The ESRB - in its strategy paper on macroprudential policy beyond banking[1], for example, emphasises the need to develop a wider financial stability toolkit, including top-down stress tests, for example, for asset managers, the need to operationalise macroprudential instruments for which a legal basis has already been created or the need to investigate the potential for increasing the consistency of available macroprudential instruments across sectors.[2] In its report on stress test analytics for macroprudential purposes in the euro area, the ECB also outlines the plans for extending stress testing into other sectors, most prominently the shadow banking sector, but also into the stress testing of central counterparties and insurance and pension funds.[3]  Let me first set the stage by reiterating the two main systemic risks stemming from the non-bank financial sector.  First, the increasing size and growth of the euro area investment fund sector has the potential to amplify financial stability risks, both in terms of liquidity and leverage. As an example of the structural change in the European financial sector, it is worthwhile noting that the size of the money market and investment fund sector represented only 17% of banks’ total assets in 2008 but is now at 40%. Whereas the banking sector shrank by 18% since the crisis, the fund sector more than doubled since 2008.  The continued inflows into bond funds for example, may raise concerns about sudden redemptions in response to a more widespread repricing in global fixed income markets, if it were to occur. Large redemption calls can have widespread amplification effects in financial markets. There are signs that fixed income investment funds have increased their risk taking in recent years via a higher asset allocation to lower-rated debt securities and an increased duration in their fixed income portfolios. At the same time, there is evidence that redemption patterns can be procyclical, which can foster adverse market dynamics when asset prices are declining.  Second, the procyclical nature of margin and haircut-setting practices of market participants and liquidity risk propagation in collateralised securities financing and derivatives transactions is a concern for financial stability. These practices stimulate the build-up of excessive leverage and funding risk in good times, while amplifying funding stress and deleveraging in bad times.  Collateralised transactions, while limiting counterparty risk, have the potential to amplify funding liquidity risk or market risk via fire sales in a stress scenario. The resulting propagation of risk may be material and potentially of systemic nature. Non-bank financial institutions can be part of the risk transmission mechanism, in particular, since they do not have recourse to central bank liquidity.  2. Macroprudential stress test to gauge the magnitude of the risks stemming from the non-bank financial sector So the questions arise: how to appropriately measure these risks and how to derive policy instruments that are effective in mitigating these risks? What are the challenges for macroprudential stress tests to provide meaningful indicators to measure and predict the level of systemic risk, the position of the economy in the financial cycle and consequently the adequate stance of macroprudential policies? In recent years, stress testing has become an increasingly prominent approach to gauging impact of a large shock on the agents’ financial soundness and on the market functioning.  Developed originally for assessing banking system resilience, macroprudential stress tests have recently been extended to cover a wider range of non-bank financial institutions: let me mention insurance companies (conducted by EIOPA), CCPs (conducted by ESMA) and asset managers.  This more recent development is largely reflecting the increasing importance of non-bank financial institutions within the EU financial system.  However, stress testing tools for non-banks are still in a fledgling state, in particular in how they capture system-wide effects.[4] Let me elaborate on what needs to be improved to operationalise them.  First and foremost, in order to conduct proper stress test analysis for the non-bank financial sector, data availability needs to be significantly improved. A successful application of the system-wide stress test models hinges upon availability of reliable data sources for model calibration and validation. In general, the availability of sufficiently granular and historical data series for the non-bank financial sector is still lagging behind the situation on the banking side. These concerns notwithstanding, it should be acknowledged that data availability is improving in some areas following some important initiatives of financial regulators and overseers. In Europe, trade repository reporting under EMIR is one example that can shed light on interconnectedness via derivative markets.[5] Another European initiative to improve information about SFT should go live in Q1 2019 with the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) transaction reporting obligation.  Furthermore, ad hoc, targeted data collections can help improve the calibration of stress testing models and inform further required changes to the regular financial reporting. If properly constructed, such ad hoc data collections can provide deep insights into potential shock transmission channels.[6] I would like to stress that the research community can offer useful advice on relevant data dimensions in this regard and therefore should be actively involved in designing such data collection templates.  As far as the second enhancement is concerned, existing non-bank stress test approaches need to better account for interactions between agents. We know from experience that the impact of a stress test event hitting a financial institution is often amplified via its interactions with the rest of the financial system. Therefore, failing to account for such interactions may risk overestimating the resilience of single institutions and the system as a whole. Some extensions to the traditional stress testing have already been operationalised, at least for the banking system. I would like to emphasise the inclusion of strategic behaviour (e.g. balance sheet portfolio optimisation in STAMP€ analytical framework of the ECB[7]), game theoretical approaches to handle strategic responses to shocks and activity of other market participants (e.g. in the MFRAF stress testing framework of Bank of Canada), network effects capturing interlinkages (e.g. in the RAMSI framework of Bank of England or the ECB top-down stress test model[8]) or feedback loops with the real economy (e.g. DSGE models in STAMP€). Third, as their business models and behaviour differ from traditional banks, specificities of non-bank financial institutions have to be considered carefully when designing tools to stress them. Both the policy and academic communities are looking into ways to enhance stress testing models for macroprudential policy. STAMP€ is one example. Let me mention a few others focusing on integrating behaviours of different types of agents and on analysing the increasing pool of data. One enhancement is about fire sales mechanisms stemming from interactions between banks and shadow banks.[9] Another example worth mentioning is about systemic aspects of liquidity and its links with solvency conditions accounting for pertinent interactions between market participants captured in an agent-based modelling fashion.[10] Though, what is still required is further strong support from the research community to provide theoretical foundations for the various components of the stress test apparatus. 3. Macroprudential tools to address the risk stemming from the non-bank sector Despite these limitations, we should also note the progress made in understanding how stress testing exercises, in particular, have the potential to support macroprudential policy in the design, calibration and assessment of the impact of macroprudential tools. Let me now turn to the state of play regarding the implementation and progress made for some of the specific macroprudential instruments that authorities would need, should systemic risks materialise.  On the global level, the 2017 FSB policy recommendations on asset management structural vulnerabilities[11], now being operationalised by IOSCO, are expected to reduce liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds. Importantly, recommendation 8 captures the potential macroprudential role for authorities to provide direction on the use of liquidity risk management tools (e.g. suspension of redemptions) by funds in extraordinary circumstances. In the area of liquidity mismatch, the recommendations also address the potential use of system-wide stress testing by authorities. Leverage recommendations focus on the measurement and monitoring of leverage within investment funds, including data for synthetic leverage calculation. On the European level, on-going work of the Expert Group on Investment Funds (EGIF) develops recommendations that are addressed to funds and asset managers. Given that the investment fund sector is growing relative to the financial system as a whole, the ESRB is analysing systemic risks posed by liquidity mismatch and leverage in the types of investment funds exposed to these risks.  To highlight the importance of this work, let me preview results of an ECB Occasional Paper[12] to be published soon. The study shows, for a large sample of European Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), that open-ended leveraged funds experience greater investor outflows after bad performance than unleveraged funds.  This can be explained by investors expecting proportionally larger valuation losses when remaining invested in leveraged funds. During stressed periods, leveraged funds need to de-lever proportionality more than unleveraged funds in order to obtain liquidity to cover margin calls and higher haircuts on leveraged positions. Also, leveraged funds have to sell relatively more assets following redemption requests to keep the leverage ratio constant. To the extent these asset sales impact market prices or are sold at fire sale prices, the net asset value of the portfolio declines.  These new findings on the greater vulnerability of leveraged funds to potential investor runs support the idea that mismatches between the portfolio liquidity and redemption terms of leveraged funds are undesirable for more leveraged funds from a macroprudential perspective. They also complement existing evidence on the greater sensitivity of investor outflows to bad performance in illiquid versus liquid funds, which can be explained by higher liquidation costs for less liquid assets.  Within the EU, competent authorities already have legal powers to impose macroprudential leverage limits on AIFs, such as hedge funds, bond funds and funds-of-funds. The ESRB has marked the operationalisation of this existing policy tool as a key part of the agenda to develop macroprudential policy beyond banking.[13] Achieving this goal is important and may require an EU-level framework to assess financial stability risks related to leverage in the investment fund sector and to evaluate potential designs for macroprudential leverage limits.  For risks in SFT and derivatives, as I have laid in a keynote speech at a dedicated conference last year here at the ESRB[14], I am convinced that macroprudential margins and haircuts are tools that have the potential to allow authorities to control the build-up of excessive leverage in these markets. Importantly, these tools can reach beyond the banking system and also address the build-up of leverage and liquidity risks in parts of the financial system, where we have seen rapid growth in recent years. Since then, we have made some progress on this front. For example, the ESRB has published a comprehensive report on the macroprudential use of margins and haircuts this year. The report describes in detail the mechanics of how these tools would affect leverage and procyclicality. Nevertheless, the report also acknowledges a number of implementation challenges and calls for further empirical and conceptual analysis. So let me conclude by saying that despite the progress made, there is more work to be done: on the operationalisation of tools, on further improving data or the interaction with the policy and research community to enhance stress testing models. I would therefore encourage authorities, including the European Commission, the ESRB but also ESMA to continue to contribute towards this goal.      [1] See Macroprudential policy beyond banking: an ESRB strategy paper.

In my concluding remarks, I will discuss a few issues raised during the conference. Understanding inflation dynamics is especially important today due to the surprisingly low inflation levels prevailing in many countries. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that in some countries, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation seems to have weakened recently. In this context, a striking development is the emergence, of a “twin puzzle” after the Great Recession: first, “missing disinflation” from 2009 to 2011 (Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015), and second, “missing inflation or reflation” after 2012, particularly in Europe (Constâncio, 2015). During the Great Recession, inflation in advanced countries did not fall as much as the usual relation between inflation and economic slack, otherwise known as the Phillips curve, would have predicted, given the severity and length of the recession. Just as puzzling, more recent global developments point in the opposite direction. Between 2012 and 2017, both headline and core inflation in the euro area were lower than expected (i.e. lower than forecasted by the Eurosystem and other institutions). Despite the ongoing recovery, headline inflation rates in several advanced economies remain well below target.  In light of these developments, the ESCB set up a network of experts to study the causes of this low inflation and to research the implications for policy (Ciccarelli and Osbat, 2017). That network has helped us to better understand inflation dynamics in the euro area. In particular, we now know that low inflation in the euro area had different origins: initially, it was mainly due to external factors (the fall in foreign demand, energy and food prices) while, after 2012, inflation was predominantly driven by domestic sources in an environment of weak demand.  Still, a great deal remains to be understood. In this respect, the research presented at this conference has shed light on many angles. Several conference papers have added to our understanding of the drivers of inflation, the nature of inflation dynamics and inflation expectations, also highlighting how new data can help us improve our knowledge. The dynamics of inflation after the financial crisis and the apparent disconnect with real activity led to a belief that this relationship might have broken down or at least became unstable, for headline inflation as well as for core inflation and wages. From a policymaker’s perspective, such an apparent breakdown is serious. The presence of a structural Phillips curve relationship is part of the traditional transmission mechanism which central banks rely on to control inflation over the medium-term. The apparent disconnect between inflation and economic slack seems to have made interpreting and controlling inflation dynamics more difficult, with significant consequences for the conduct of monetary policy. Namely, the inflation trade-offs would worsen: on the one hand, if inflation rises as a result of cost-push shocks unrelated to domestic slack, then it would be more costly, in terms of output loss, to bring inflation down. On the other hand, the flip side is that a sharp dip in inflation would require a more substantial monetary policy stimulus, which in turn could be problematic given the lower bound on nominal interest rates. In sum, as I recently underlined, “a flatter slope of the Phillips curve would make controlling inflation either more costly or more difficult” (Constâncio, 2015). The reduced effect of economic slack is even more significant with regard to wages, a crucial factor of domestic underlying inflation. The fact that wages are not increasing more is an important puzzle in advanced economies. Higher wage increases were to be expected due to the strengthening of the economic recovery and are necessary in order to normalise inflation.  In any case, changes in the Phillips curve over time make the work of the central bank more difficult, especially as they have to be understood in real time. Fortunately, in recent years, , the slope of the Phillips curve has been increasing somewhat in what regards headline inflation in the euro area, especially if we use a broad concept of unemployment (Unemployment 6, which is now at 18%) to measure economic slack. This points to one of the difficulties in using Phillips curves: the choice of an appropriate measure of slack which is a multidimensional reality.  Many explanations have been put forward in the literature to rationalise the decrease of the Phillips curve coefficient of economic slack in all advanced economies. We can group them around three categories of factors: the increased importance of external shocks, including those related to globalisation; the enhanced role of expectations in influencing wage and price decisions, anchored by central bank targets, and finally, the existence of non-linearities and time-varying behaviour of different Phillips curve coefficients.  I will touch upon these three aspects of the Phillips curve relationships that can be at the root of the recent inflation puzzles, trying to link them with the papers and discussions at this conference. . External shocks and exchange rate pass-through Let me start with external shocks or global drivers of inflation. There are several dimensions of the growing importance of international developments in influencing domestic inflation rates notably those related with economic and financial globalisation. Some economists have gone as far as to maintain that the global economic slack became more important than the domestic one to explain inflation to the point of significantly eroding the role of monetary policy in controlling inflation.[1] However, it is very difficult to capture, in quantitative analyses, all the effects of globalisation on inflation. The channels are various and as they overlap, not all of them can be included at the same time.  First, one can list the increased import content of economic activity as trade grows, the extension of global value chains and the augmented input-output linkages across countries. These factors are most visible through the impact of oil prices on energy inflation. Energy accounts for around 10% of the consumer goods basket used to measure the HICP. Energy inflation is very closely linked to oil prices (See ECB Economic Bulletin article 4/2017: “Domestic and global drivers of inflation in the euro area”). And then there are the indirect effects of oil prices on domestic product costs, which can then work their way through the supply chain to influence headline inflation. The global influence is, of course, not limited to oil and energy. Food prices in the euro area are affected by global food prices and prices of imported consumer goods are important for domestic inflation as well. The prices of imported goods and services directly affect headline inflation via their shares in final consumption and indirectly via their use as intermediate products. Beyond commodity prices, the role of import prices has been enhanced by the extension of global value chains and the linkages that this creates. The paper by Auer and co-authors (2017) presented at this conference illustrates this point well. Starting from the worldwide synchronisation of producer price inflation (PPI), they conclude that input-output linkages explain 50% of the global component of PPI. In another recent BIS paper, Auer, Borio and Filardo (2017) show how the relevance of global value chains explains why the contribution of the global economic slack has gained importance. Nevertheless, the analysis of Bianchi and Civelli (2015) for 50 countries from 1971 to 2006, casts some doubt about the global slack coefficient having a consistent increase accompanying the progress of globalisation. Only when the two hypotheses of a decreasing significance of the domestic slack and the increased importance of the global slack are jointly tested, do they find “that in fact trade openness enhances the relative importance of the foreign output gap on domestic inflation”  However, Ciccarelli and Mojon (2010) and Ferroni and Mojon (2014) had previously shown that the commonality of inflation globally goes beyond what can be captured by commodity prices. They also report that the global inflation factor would improve forecasts of domestic inflation in different specifications, from augmenting an AR (1) model to using it in Phillips curve or BVARs. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the importance of the common factor does not depend on spillovers among countries but is rather the result of common shocks and convergence of monetary policy frameworks around the world. One could perhaps add that the subdued behaviour of wages can be partially attributable to a common factor related to the loss of labour pricing power at the national level, stemming from the relocation threat.  Moreover, the way in which exchange rate movements pass through into import prices at the border and at the final consumer level is also critically important to understand the influence of external shocks on inflation. Consequently, understanding exchange rate pass-through into aggregate prices is vital for forecasting inflation and setting monetary policy. In this conference, the paper by Forbes et al. (2017)[2] shows that the Exchange Rate Pass-Through (ERPT) is variable, both across countries and across time. For policymakers this is a challenge, as it makes it significantly more difficult to predict the effect of fluctuations in currency markets on domestic inflation. However, an important insight from this paper and also previous work by Kristin Forbes and co-authors is that the ERPT to inflation may differ depending on the nature of the shocks that triggered the exchange rate movement, as it may reflect different transmission channels.[3] The empirical evidence confirms that different shocks exert different effects on inflation, possibly even leading to inflation responses in the opposite direction of the exchange rate movement. For instance, results in the ESCB LIFT task force (Ciccarelli and Osbat 2017) point to a significantly higher ERPT than on average in case of a monetary policy induced currency appreciation, and even to upward pressure on prices following an appreciation driven by domestic demand. In the latter case, the direct impact of domestic demand on inflation dominates the one stemming from the exchange rate. This insight is especially relevant for the euro area, as it suggests that the recent euro appreciation may have a more limited dampening effect on inflation than what would be implied by historical averages.  Finally, I would like to mention the paper presented by Laseen and Sanjani (2016) that analyses whether the financial crisis, together with globalisation has broken the Phillips curve in the U.S. the economy in which traditional reduced form single equations have shown the highest decline in the economic slack parameter. Using multivariate, time-varying methods (a large BVAR, a DFM and a MS-BVAR) they show that changes in shocks of other variables are “a more salient feature of the data than changes in coefficients”. This is encouraging as it implies that, although financial and external variables have the highest forecasting power for inflation after the crisis, their effect could be more relevant in the short-term, leaving the coefficient of the economic slack in the Phillips curve still significant. In regime-switching models they show that “what changes across regimes is most importantly the variances of structural disturbances”. Together with the slight steepening of the Phillips curve in the euro area, this gives some hope that the future closing of the output gap will allow us to gradually reach our inflation target. In any case, as stated by the ECB President in the latest ECB press conference: “a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium-term”. Insights from household inflation expectations Modern macroeconomic models attribute a central role to inflation expectations in price and wage setting. This literature has stressed the management of inflation expectations as a crucial monetary policy channel, and the importance of central bank credibility. When forward-looking agents expect the central bank to stabilise future inflation, they also react less to current disturbances in adjusting prices and wages, leading to more stable inflation outcomes. Therefore, an important element determining the effectiveness of monetary policy is the trust of the public in the commitment and the ability of the central bank to reach its target in the medium-term. In turn, measures of long-term inflation expectations are invaluable in helping to understand if expectations are well anchored.  The novelty of the work by Christelis, Georgarakos, Japelli and van Rooij presented in this conference, is that they measure both trust in the ECB and inflation expectations of individual consumers through a specifically designed survey. Indeed, their findings are reassuring because they establish a clear link between high levels of trust and inflation expectations that are anchored around the medium-term inflation target. Specifically, they find that trusting the ECB increases inflation expectations when these are below the ECB’s inflation objective, and lowers them when they are above it. Moreover, higher trust in the ECB significantly reduces uncertainty about future inflation. Their findings suggest that a central bank can influence the economy through people’s expectations, even in times when conventional monetary policy tools likely have weak effects. This is certainly very encouraging for policymakers. The literature has also made some progress in incorporating data on actual inflation expectations into macro models, usually relying on survey data. In earlier work, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) suggested a solution to the “missing disinflation” in the U.S., showing that household inflation expectations from 2009 to 2011 remained elevated, reflecting the increase in oil prices at the time. This conference has featured the paper by Slobodoyan and Wouters[4] which embeds inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters in a New Keynesian model with learning. This paper makes a strong case for entering survey expectations data into the standard dataset on which these macro-models should be estimated. What we learn is that survey information improves the model forecast for both inflation and the other macroeconomic variables, especially when expectations are modelled based on adaptive learning.  The work by Coibion and Gorodnichenko I mentioned before points to a source of stickiness in the formation of consumer inflation expectations that can lead to more stable inflation outcomes, independently of monetary policy actions, sometimes helping the monetary authority in achieving its inflation objective, sometimes making it more difficult. In this vein, the work by Weber and co-authors shows us that not all price changes are treated equally by households in forming their inflation expectations. Price changes that are more readily observed such as those that are larger or that are from goods that are purchased more frequently are more important in shaping inflation expectations. To some extent, the large cross-sectional variation of inflation expectations among households is somewhat worrisome for the policymaker, especially if (as the Weber et al. and the paper by Vellekoop and Wiederholt[5] suggest) people change their consumption behaviour and make financial decisions based on these expectations. For policymakers, this seems to suggest that there is an important role of the central bank in shaping the expectations of the general public, not only that of financial markets. It also suggests that more research is needed to understand the different factors that shape the inflation expectations of individual households, in particular the role of volatile sub-series of the HICP in shaping the inflation expectations of the general public and on the decisions that households make, based on their inflation expectations. Only more detailed data that matches inflation expectations of households with their decisions will be able to shed more light on this issue.  Building better models of nominal price rigidities This brings me to the last point of improving structural models of the Phillips curve, and the importance of non-linearities, particularly those that result from considering state-dependency of the Phillips curve and the possible different behaviour of price stickiness in different phases of the business cycle. Practically all models that are considered to be the core of modern monetary macroeconomics rely on the assumption of nominal rigidities, i.e. the fact that prices do not immediately adjust to changes in costs and demand. In such models, price stickiness is the ultimate cause of why monetary impulses have real effects and are transmitted slowly through the economy. Understanding the degree to which prices are sticky or inflation is persistent is important for central banks as it determines how interest rates need to be set to achieve the desired level of inflation.  Still, the exact nature and mechanisms that are at the core of price stickiness continue to be imperfectly understood.\\xa0 The debate among macro-economists on the foundations of nominal price rigidities, and therefore how to model them, is ongoing and far from settled. This is important for our understanding of the Phillips curve from a structural point of view, going beyond a simple correlation between inflation and economic activity. The structural Phillips curve relationship that comes out of the different models of nominal rigidities can be very different. These differences have implications for determining the degree of price stickiness and thus the slope of the Phillips curve. In general, time-dependent and state-dependent models have radically different implications in terms of the determinants of the slope of the Phillips curve, and its sensitivity to the business cycle. In line with the predictions of state-dependent models of price setting, recent research has shown that several features of the distribution of price changes vary over the business cycle (Berger and Vavra 2015). This would imply that the degree of price stickiness and thus the degree of non-neutrality of monetary policy is also different in expansions and recessions. This is a great example of how micro data can provide crucial evidence on nonlinearities that would be more difficult to detect decisively with less granular and more aggregate data. There is some evidence at the aggregate level that the slope of the Phillips curve might have changed during the period when we were over-predicting inflation. For the euro area, the evidence from several new papers points to a relative steepening recently, following the previous flattening, (see e.g. Oinonen and Paloviita (2014), Riggi and Venditti (2015) and Foroni and Porqueddu (2015)). This development is especially marked in those countries which experienced deeper and longer recessions and made greater efforts to reform their product and labour markets. Estimating the same specifications of Phillips curves over two samples, one stopping at 2012 Q1 (when we started systematically over-predicting inflation) and the other covering a longer sample, one finds evidence of an increase in the slope estimate. Indeed, regime-switching estimates, accounting for parameter change depending on the state of the business cycle, can help to explain the “excessive” disinflation since 2012 and justify the expectations about future normalisation. Concluding remarks Let me conclude. The findings of many papers in this conference would not have been possible without the use of detailed micro data. Micro data help us identify the channels of transmission better, such as when household expectations determine household choices or when micro price allow us to build better micro-founded models. The Eurosystem has already previously organised a number of large-scale research efforts with the aim of better understanding prices and price-setting at the micro-level: the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network (Angeloni et al. (2006); Álvarez et al. (2006); Dhyne et al (2006); Fabiani et al (2007); Vermeulen et al (2012)), and an expert group studying Nielsen scanner data in 2012 (ECB, Economic Bulletin, Issue I, 2015).\\xa0\\xa0There is a lot of potential for research on price-setting behaviour, especially given the recent opportunities to enhance access to relevant data. This is why we have made micro-price research a strategic priority in our research work plan for the next three years. A primary task will be a renewed effort in collecting a wealth of new price micro data for the euro area countries. The contribution of academic research to this ambitious agenda will be vital, and this conference is a great example of how much we can benefit from it. References Álvarez, L., E. Dhyne, M.

I am happy to see my friend Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. We see each other in Frankfurt every other week so I am pleased to see him in a different setting. It’s also nice to see my former colleague Patrick Honohan. And a warm welcome to all of you. I am especially honoured to speak here in Ireland for the first time and here in this prestigious, world-class institution, Trinity College, Dublin. Many of you are students, and to speak to young people who will carry today’s message into tomorrow’s world always entails a special responsibility. With it comes the honour of having been chosen to give this address. Your lives are being changed forever by the education of exceptional quality that you are receiving here, in a testimony to the history of Trinity, its birth, its glorious past and its distinguished alumni.  I should especially acknowledge its extraordinary teachers, including Patrick Honohan, former Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, and his successor Philip Lane.  The Book of Kells, on permanent display here at Trinity, with its history and its beauty, reminds us of the importance of nurturing knowledge, spreading it throughout the world, and protecting it in times of peril. It also tells us how important Ireland and its culture are for Europe. It is well known how relevant the role of Irish monastic orders was in preserving our European cultural heritage in the early medieval period. At the turn of the 7th century, St.\\xa0Columban embarked on a journey across Europe. From the Atlantic to the Alps, he founded monasteries which were the centres of learning of his time. Along the way, he urged kings and commoners alike to adopt a notion of a European society rooted in the universal values of human life, the common good and education.  Robert Schuman, a founding father of the European Union, honoured St.\\xa0Columban in 1950, saying that “this illustrious Irishman who left his own country for voluntary exile, willed and achieved a spiritual union between the principal European countries of his time. He is the patron saint of all those who now seek to build a united Europe.”  It is with these thoughts in mind that I have chosen the topic of our meeting today: young people and the labour market in Europe.  Youth unemployment in the euro area Youth unemployment is not a recent phenomenon. It was high over the last few decades, driven both by cyclical and long-term structural factors. In Europe, the worsening labour market performance for young people became apparent in the 1970s, when unemployment increased from 4.6% to 11.1% by the end of the decade, partly due to the substantial increase in supply as the so-called baby-boomers entered the labour market. But even when the size of this group declined, the relative labour market performance did not improve. There was some recovery in the early 1990s, but it never returned to the level of the early 1970s.[1] In 2007, when total unemployment in the euro area declined to 7.5%, its lowest level since the early 1980s, the unemployment rate for young people was already very high at around 15%.  Youth unemployment is not just structural but also highly pro-cyclical. During the Great Recession, and the corresponding cyclical downturn, youth unemployment surged markedly. Between 2007 and 2013, it increased by about 9 percentage points in the euro area – twice as much as the overall unemployment rate.  But euro area aggregates hide important differences across the euro area. Greece and Spain entered the crisis with youth unemployment rates of 23% and 18% respectively, and reached rates well above 50% by 2013. In Ireland, it tripled over the same period, peaking at 30%. In comparison, the youth unemployment rate in Germany, a country less affected by the cyclical downturn, declined from about 12% in 2007 to about 8% in 2013. What is the situation now? The ongoing economic recovery in the euro area has led to improved labour market conditions. Euro area real GDP has now grown for 17 consecutive quarters, creating in total over 6 million jobs. As a result, from its peak in 2013, the youth unemployment rate fell from 24% to around 19% in 2016, but is still about 4 percentage points higher than at the beginning of the crisis in 2007.[2] In Ireland, where real GDP grew 5.2% last year, it declined by more than 13 percentage points from its peak, and is now below the euro area average.  However, headline unemployment rates give only a partial picture of the labour market situation. Many young people in the euro area are still in education or are not actively seeking employment. The possible significant social and economic consequences are even more relevant if we look at new measures of labour utilisation, taking into account both unemployed people and those not involved in further education or training. In 2016, around 17% of people between the ages of 20 and 24 in the euro area were neither in employment, education or training, with Ireland being close to this euro area average. [3] In Greece and Spain, the numbers are 23% and 21% respectively.  The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment across Member States point to continued underlying problems in labour market structures, with correspondingly high costs for our societies. Long-term costs of youth unemployment Cyclical unemployment can turn structural if people remain unemployed for a long time. Protracted periods of unemployment can result in “scarring” effects, leading to a greater likelihood of future unemployment, human capital losses and lower earnings[4]. And this has negative effects not only on life satisfaction, but also on health, and may persist well into later life. The sense of detachment that is produced by prolonged unemployment has been well documented in several social experiments. With a large proportion of young people not having any defined role in society (neither looking for jobs, nor acquiring the skills to find one), there is a high risk of social cohesion and of trust in public institutions being undermined, with harm for medium-term growth prospects.[5]  Youth unemployment is also costly in terms of long-term productivity. High-productivity firms, particularly in their early expansion phase,[6] are more likely to hire young people because that group will help them to become more innovative. Innovation is driven, among other things, by curiosity and creativity. The fact that young people are more curious requires no further explanation; the teachers among you or those of you with children or grandchildren are well aware of that.  When it comes to creativity, age plays a crucial role. Creativity can be measured, for example, by the number of original and valuable contributions to fields such as science and art. By that measure, output first increases in our mid-20s, reaches a peak when we are in our 30s or early 40s, and then undergoes a slow decline as we age[7].  So to foster innovation, it is very much in the interest of firms to recruit young people[8].  The young are also in a better position to facilitate knowledge diffusion. In this regard, labour mobility is key. During the early years of their careers, young workers, in the search for a better job, move more frequently between professions and assignments. As we get older we change jobs less often: at the age of 40 we switch half as much as we do at 20.[9] The mobility of the young is likely to facilitate an efficient allocation of labour through higher job-to-job transitions. And this mobility across firms and sectors, and sometimes across regions and countries, contributes to the diffusion and expansion of knowledge. For these reasons, youth employment and productivity growth create a virtuous circle. When firms become more productive they are more likely to employ young people. And when young people have such opportunities, they can capitalise on their skills, adding to productivity growth, which among other benefits for society will lead to higher wages.  Youth unemployment breaks this virtuous circle: it is a drag on innovation and impedes knowledge diffusion by decreasing mobility.  Additionally, unemployment prevents experienced workers and young workers from interacting. The experienced ones don’t benefit from insights and knowledge of the young. And they, in turn, don’t gain from the know-how of more experienced workers. The role of policies  As we have seen, there are cyclical and structural reasons for the high rates of youth unemployment.  Demand-side policies, such as fiscal and monetary policy, can help to address cyclical fluctuations. Our monetary policy measures, aimed at maintaining price stability, are supporting domestic demand and thus the recovery in employment, from which also younger generations of Europeans are benefiting.  Furthermore, we should not forget that the crisis was a financial crisis, and therefore financial policies are also essential. It is important to further improve the resilience of the financial system by strengthening sectoral balance sheets, and having an appropriate financial regulatory and supervisory framework, and a robust macroprudential policy framework.[10]  But the rise in youth unemployment has also deeply rooted structural reasons. The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment rates across the euro area countries even before the crisis, as well as the diverse developments during the crisis, indicate that there is need for specific policies to improve education and labour market functioning in some countries. Higher levels of education are positively correlated with both greater labour market participation and lower unemployment. The risk of losing a job is significantly higher for people with low educational attainment. And this group was severely hit by the crisis, with their unemployment rate increasing from about 11% in 2008 to 21% in 2013 in the euro area. The pattern is similar for young workers. For example, in Ireland the unemployment rate of young people with an educational attainment below lower secondary education was 27.5% in 2016, while for young people with tertiary education it was about 11%. Acquiring a good skill set at school and university is therefore essential for a young person to find work. However, skill mismatch indicators – which quantify the difference between skills wanted and skills offered – still remain at elevated levels, with only a slight moderation compared with the record levels at the height of the financial crisis.[11]  But skill mismatches are not just a consequence of the crisis. In fact, they started to increase before the crisis because of structural changes related to digitalisation and globalisation. The skill mismatch index for the euro area labour market in 2007 was almost twice as high as it was in 2004.[12]  There is also large heterogeneity across the euro area countries. The OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills shows that while young adults in, for instance, Finland and the Netherlands perform well in problem-solving in technology-rich environments, in other countries they score significantly lower and youth unemployment is correspondingly higher.[13] Furthermore, the correlation between PISA scores and youth unemployment in the euro area is strong and negative.[14]  The percentage of the working age population that has completed upper secondary or tertiary education ranges widely in the euro area – from a high of more than 90% in some countries to a low of around 40% in others. The need for improving skills has also been confirmed by the results of an ad hoc ECB survey of leading euro area businesses. The survey revealed that over 90% of businesses strongly supported reforms geared to enhancing the quality of education and training.[15] These factors were deemed particularly relevant in the light of shifts towards knowledge-intensive skill sets, digitalisation and given long-standing structural deficits in engineering skills. Other non-tertiary education, such as the dual training and apprenticeship systems which we have in some euro area countries, has also been shown as helping to facilitate the transition from school to work. In particular, Austria and Germany have been successful in keeping youth unemployment low mostly because of their efficient use of vocational training and programmes targeted at disadvantaged youth.[16]  The employment prospects of the young also depend on the existence of efficient labour market institutions. The vocational education system, together with more flexible wage setting, and stronger public support for helping the unemployed to seek and find jobs, as well as lower labour market segmentation explain in part why the youth unemployment rate is lower in Germany than in France.[17] Furthermore, labour market rigidities decrease both inflows into and outflows from employment, and tend to reduce hiring of the young, especially during recessions.  In dual labour markets, it is typically young workers that have temporary contracts and that shoulder much of the burden of adjustment. Segmentation of the labour market and poor vocational training are also among the main reasons for the persistent high level of youth unemployment in several countries that have been hit severely by the recession such as Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. [18]  The role of Europe Europe’s role in addressing the problem is primarily defined by its Single Market that has removed many barriers to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. Indeed, the Single Market fosters competition among firms. In the long run, firms’ competitiveness is not only determined by pricing, but also by other product features that meet customer demands. Knowledge and innovation of products and processes are therefore essential.  The Single Market requires firms to be more productive, so that they activate the virtuous circle between productivity growth and youth employment that I described earlier. And indeed, the countries that have a high degree of openness and have benefited most from the Single Market, are also those with lower youth unemployment[19].  Therefore, also to support youth employment and incomes, the first and most important policy decision at European level is to complete the Single Market in all its dimensions. But to fully reap the benefits of openness, the Single Market needs to be embedded in supportive policies and institutions. Competition not only creates opportunities for some firms to expand, it also drives others out of business and displaces workers in entire industries. It is therefore essential that those workers are supported when resources are channelled towards more productive firms or sectors. Protecting people, rather than jobs, means ensuring that they have or will acquire the necessary skills to be employed in other more productive parts of the economy. Today much of this support falls under the competence of Member States, but also the EU can build on existing instruments, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Social Fund. [20]  There is a second way in which European integration can support youth employment: by fostering the exchange of ideas and knowledge as researchers, students, and technologies move across Europe. [21]  I am sure that many of the students here have been on an Erasmus exchange, or have come from other European countries to study here. There is clearly a European dimension to education. And Europe can contribute by investing in such exchanges as well as more broadly in the advancement of science.  The new Erasmus+, which now offers more opportunities for learning and training, is thus a welcome development. And the Bologna Process makes it easier for young people to work in another EU country by facilitating the recognition of qualifications across borders. Moreover, the Youth Guarantee programme provides welcome support to the commitment by Member States to ensure that young Europeans under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, training or continued education.  Labour mobility is often, when undesired, the result of poor cyclical and structural labour market conditions. It is those conditions that should be addressed in the first place. The completion of the Single Market, the continuing progress in European integration and the deepening of our Economic and Monetary Union, will further expand the opportunities for young people beyond borders, and job matching possibilities. Labour mobility across countries and sectors is bound to increase. This will require adequate supranational policies.  Conclusion  Let me conclude. In some countries, and Ireland is one of them, some progress in reducing youth unemployment has been achieved. More generally, the strengthening of the recovery in the euro area will continue to reduce its extent. But to address structural causes of youth unemployment, a uniform degree of protection among workers, flexible labour arrangements, effective vocational training programmes, high degree of trade openness, and support to reduce the social cost of mobility are all necessary conditions.  I have highlighted the economic reasons that make addressing youth unemployment an invaluable undertaking. But there is a more fundamental reason to continue addressing this challenge with determination and as a priority. We have seen how in several countries the weight of the crisis has fallen disproportionately on the young people, leaving a legacy of failed hopes, anger and ultimately mistrust in the values of our society and in the identity of our democracy. Some say that a more equitable distribution of income and wealth is the answer and that it would bring those who have lost out from globalisation back into our compact. But that cannot be enough for the young people who are the future of our democracies. They do not want to live on subsidies. They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities. Today after the crisis, governments know how to respond to their quest, and how to create an environment where their hopes have a chance. They should do so: for the future of their countries’ youth and of their democracy.       [1] See Bell, D. and D.G. Blanchflower (2011): Young People and the Great Recession.

I would like to thank Governor Softić for the invitation to speak to you on this occasion.  When the CBBH was founded in 1997, people in western Europe were still paying with their national currencies. The ECB did not yet exist and there had not even been a decision on which countries would eventually participate in monetary union from its launch. For a European central banker, this almost feels like ancient history. The past 20 years have been too hectic, too exciting and too eventful to fully appreciate the passage of time. So significant birthdays are always a welcome opportunity to take a step back and consider what has worked and what has not. And for the CBBH, like for many other central banks, there can only be one yardstick to measure success: the achievement of monetary stability, the primary objective of the CBBH. And looking back over the past 20 years, you clearly have delivered on your mandate. By effectively implementing the currency board arrangement, you created trust and confidence in the currency and you were able to secure this confidence over time. I would like to congratulate the past and present management and all staff of the CBBH for this success over the past 20 years.  Your achievements are particularly remarkable when seen in the light of the challenges you have faced in implementing the monetary framework. A small, open economy like Bosnia and Herzegovina, where total merchandise trade accounts for more than two-thirds of nominal GDP, is constantly exposed to foreign shocks that are often hard to anticipate. This is a demanding environment for central banks, in particular when several shocks hit the economy at the same time, as has been the case in recent years. In fact, it is probably fair to say that the global economy was in almost constant flux following the outbreak of the financial crisis ten years ago. Here in Europe, of course, and in the euro area in particular, we faced significant challenges that required unprecedented action by central banks and governments.  So the current resilience and broad-based strengthening of the global economy represents a welcome change for policymakers, here and in many other parts of the world. An increasing number of economies, across both advanced and emerging markets, are benefiting from the recovery. Unemployment has fallen to pre-crisis levels in many countries. And the broad stabilisation of oil prices has reduced the strong disinflationary pressures that were putting additional downside pressure on headline inflation at a time of economic hardship in many regions around the globe. The euro area too is now contributing to global growth, rather than subtracting from it, in large part thanks to the range of monetary policy measures taken by the ECB in recent years. This is certainly good news for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where exports to the euro area account for more than half of total exports.  Making the cyclical recovery sustainable  At the same time, the current global cyclical recovery also harbours risks – risks of complacency and inaction. Despite the encouraging upturn in growth and the shift in consumer and investor sentiment, some of the more fundamental obstacles to sustainable growth have not disappeared. In the euro area, for example, there is still considerable scope in all Member States to improve the range of economic, social and legal frameworks that shape the conditions in which households and businesses operate. We should not allow ourselves to succumb to the false impression that the current cyclical recovery will heal all wounds. Deep-seated structural reforms are needed to boost potential growth, raise productivity, increase resilience to shocks and, ultimately, foster sustainable real convergence among Member States. In a speech in Brussels a few months ago, I highlighted the clear empirical relationship in Europe between the quality of institutions and GDP per capita.[1] This means that sustainable growth requires unfailing policy efforts to ensure that our institutions are fit for purpose.  In a globalised world, where we are more likely than not to be directly affected by the actions of others, this is probably true for all countries, whether inside or outside the euro area or the EU. What the EU offers, however, is a framework to overcome common global challenges together, as long as all Member States play by the rules. For candidate and potential candidate countries this means that adopting suitable economic and legal structures and putting in place the appropriate institutions in good time will allow many of the benefits of EU membership to be frontloaded.  This also applies to central banking. The ECB, and in fact the entire European System of Central Banks (ESCB), supports central banks in the region on their path towards joining the EU. While the ECB plays no formal role in the EU accession process, it contributes in its areas of competence. As you know, we maintain close relations with central banks in candidate and potential candidate countries, which will eventually become part of the ESCB and later the Eurosystem.  Through technical cooperation, we also support central banks in building and enhancing institutional capacity. This may take the form of EU-funded programmes, twinnings with ESCB national central banks or regional workshops and seminars hosted by the ECB. The CBBH was one of the first beneficiaries of such technical cooperation in the region through EU-funded and ECB-coordinated programmes in 2007 and 2010-11. These programmes also involved many EU national central banks and are remembered as being very successful. In addition, the ECB contributes to the assessment of the Economic Reform Programmes of candidate and potential candidate countries as part of the EU’s economic and financial dialogue with applicants. Here the ECB naturally focuses on monetary and exchange rate policies and financial stability. Our views then feed into the joint conclusions of the economic and financial dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans and Turkey.  This year the ECB recommended that countries take five main actions: (i) adopt and implement comprehensive non-performing loan (NPL) resolution strategies; (ii)\\xa0strengthen the use of local currencies; (iii) expand the analytical and policy toolkits of central banks; (iv) reinforce the medium-term orientation of fiscal policies; and, finally, (v) improve the overall business and institutional environment, with a view to reducing external vulnerabilities, among other things. Many of these recommendations also apply to current EU Member States, as I alluded to before. In particular, low productivity, together with large stocks of NPLs and sovereign debt, remain a drag on growth in large parts of the euro area. Also with respect to the third recommendation, on expanding the policy toolkit of central banks, the ECB is no exception. The environment of low interest rates and low inflation forces us to constantly review and upgrade our analytical toolkit to ensure we take the best possible decisions in our pursuit of price stability.[2]  Unofficial euroisation as a policy challenge Let me therefore spend a few minutes on the one recommendation that is specific to candidate and potential candidate countries, albeit not uniformly to all, namely that the use of local currencies be strengthened.  As you know, the high degree of unofficial euroisation is a striking feature of the banking systems in the Western Balkans. In the region as a whole, on average 56% of total loans and 52% of total deposits are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, in most cases the euro.[3] This phenomenon, also known as currency substitution, is driven by many factors, such as low confidence in the domestic currency, which is often the result of not-so-distant memories of monetary instability.  Another factor relates to the fact that the risk premium on loans in the domestic currency is higher, thereby providing an incentive to take out foreign currency loans. Lower funding costs, in turn, are often supported through strong integration with the euro area via trade and financial channels, but also via migration and remittances, which contribute to the holding of bank deposits in euro. All this is conducive to widespread unofficial “euroisation”. But a high degree of foreign currency use also has serious drawbacks. For example, unofficial euroisation, while being a sign of trust in the euro as a stable store of value, constitutes a financial stability risk in the event of sudden and substantial exchange rate fluctuations. Households and firms may suddenly no longer be able to service their foreign currency-denominated debt, creating credit risk for banks. The same holds true for dollarisation in other parts of the world, as the Asian financial crisis vividly demonstrated. Unofficial euroisation also impedes monetary policy transmission and may limit the overall room for manoeuvre of monetary policy. In Albania and Serbia, for instance, where central banks have adopted inflation-targeting frameworks, exchange rate flexibility remains relatively limited as policymakers are mindful of adverse balance sheet effects resulting from sudden and substantial exchange rate fluctuations. In countries that have opted to stabilise the exchange rate in the first place, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, maintaining the credibility of the framework remains central to keeping financial stability risks contained.  Prospective EU countries that have their own legal tender and monetary policy have recognised these risks and constraints, and are thus making efforts to promote the use of the local currency, in line with the ECB’s recommendations. This is certainly not an easy task. Success crucially hinges upon the track record of the domestic monetary authority in maintaining monetary stability. To this end, central banks in the region have made laudable progress in recent years. Efforts need to be channelled towards extending this track record.  History teaches us that central banks’ success in sustainably maintaining confidence in the currency critically hinges on two elements: political independence and a clear mandate. The ECB was successfully built on these principles. Independence and a clear stability-oriented mandate ensure that central banks are not overburdened with pursuing other, potentially conflicting objectives, and that monetary policy makes the best possible contribution to growth and employment. They are therefore also a necessary condition for strengthening the use of local currencies.  Experience in other regions of the world – in Latin America, for example – suggests that targeted prudential measures as well as deeper local capital markets in domestic currency can reinforce the use of local currencies.[4] Such advances should ideally be embedded in a carefully designed comprehensive strategy involving all relevant stakeholders. Serbia adopted such strategies in 2012, and Albania has done so more recently, while other countries have started to put in place measures of this nature or are considering designing similar strategies.  So progress is clearly visible, in particular on the lending side, but more remains to be done. There are certainly no quick fixes, as currency substitution tends to be a sticky phenomenon. But the drawbacks of unofficial euroisation deserve policymakers’ attention. The expectation that countries will at some point join the EU, and eventually also the euro area, should not divert attention from such policy efforts. Conclusion Remaining challenges, however, should not distract from past achievements. So let me conclude by congratulating you once more on the impressive track record that the CBBH has built up over the past 20 years.  The ECB will continue to offer technical cooperation and advice whenever possible, and we will accompany you and other central banks in the Western Balkans on your journey towards the EU. We look forward to our future work with colleagues from the region, including you, Governor Softić, and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish you and your colleagues all the best for the next 20 years and beyond.  Thank you for your attention.      [1] For more information, see B.

      "['2017-09-21', 'Mario Draghi', 'Building on the achievements of post-crisis reforms', 'Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the second annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2017', '  Building on the achievements of post-crisis reforms   Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the second annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2017 It is my pleasure to welcome you to the second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).  The conference coincides with the tenth anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis in the summer of 2007. The crisis shook the European Union to the core, and required substantial policy actions to stabilise the economy and the financial system. With a return to stability having been achieved, it is important that we take time to reflect on what we have learnt, what we have achieved over the past ten years, and where we need to do further work. The crisis taught us that individual banks and the banking system as a whole needed to be more resilient than they were pre-crisis. As a result, many reforms have been put in place in recent years. Our banking regulation and supervision have become stricter. Moreover, the European regulatory framework now places greater emphasis on identifying and addressing system-wide risks. This includes the establishment of the ESRB and the creation of macroprudential instruments assigned to public authorities.  A more resilient post-crisis banking sector In the banking sector, significant efforts have been made in recent years to increase resilience. In the euro area, for example, the average Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions rose from 7% in 2008 to 13.5% by end-2016. And banks are required to set up solid governance structures and prudent risk management practices. Moreover, resilience is now tested more rigorously in a forward-looking manner. The EU-wide stress tests coordinated by the European Banking Authority (EBA) have become an important tool for quantifying banks’ capital needs, with a view to ensuring that they would be able to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers even during a severe recession.[1], [2]  Post-crisis prudential rules have also provided public authorities with macroprudential tools to address systemic risks in the banking sector.[3] And the understanding of how to calibrate and implement these tools has advanced. For example, all Member States now have a countercyclical capital buffer framework that is fully operational. [4] Four Member States have announced a non-zero buffer rate for domestic exposures. Yet despite these steps forward, it is important to remain vigilant. One important aspect concerns the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policies.[5] Financial and business cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances can grow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation. In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances.  Indeed, the ESRB last year identified medium-term vulnerabilities in some countries’ residential real estate sectors – precisely the type of situation that macroprudential policies are designed to address. It published country-specific warnings to eight Member States in November 2016, in accordance with its mandate to identify and flag significant systemic risks.[6]  But beyond increasing the resilience of the banking sector, there is also a need to address the remaining legacies of the crisis. Two important aspects are the resolution of already impaired assets, and better accounting for impaired assets for the future.  Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks’ balance sheets remains high.[7] At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around €1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks’ profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks.[8]  The outstanding stock of NPLs is a consequence of cyclical and structural factors. First, the severe recession resulting from the global financial crisis led to a deterioration of the quality of banks’ loan books. The current economic expansion should therefore help to improve the asset quality of European banks. At the same time, structural weaknesses still persist. These include inadequate internal governance structures in banks, ineffective and costly debt recovery procedures in some Member States and misaligned incentives that prevent a quick resolution of NPLs. To this end, the ESRB has proposed[9] a series of measures to complement those already being taken at EU and euro area level.[10]  In the short term, the ESRB’s proposals focus on strengthening banks’ NPL management, including their prudent measurement and the valuation of the associated collateral. Policymakers could aid this process by developing blueprints for asset management companies, accompanied by harmonised data templates across the EU.  Measures should also concentrate on insolvency regimes, debt recovery and servicing capacities with a view to improving recovery rates from NPLs. Over a longer horizon, secondary markets’ trading platforms should be further developed. And banks also need to be given adequate incentives, in particular in relation to accounting for impaired assets.  From 1 January 2018 onwards, a new accounting standard for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, known as IFRS 9[11], becomes mandatory in EU. At the request of the European Parliament, the ESRB has recently published a report on the financial stability implications of IFRS 9,[12] which concludes that it is a major improvement, particularly regarding accounting for NPLs. The most important change introduced by IFRS 9 is the shift from an incurred loss approach to an expected credit loss approach for measuring impairment allowances. This means that banks will have to recognise impairments earlier, curtailing excessive forbearance towards NPLs and helping ensure that banking sector repair takes place in a timelier and more comprehensive manner in future downturns. A recent impact assessment, based on a sample of 54 banks across 20 Member States published by the European Banking Authority, suggests that the introduction of IFRS 9 would lead to an increase of provisions of about 13% on average.[13]  The expected credit loss approach also means that banks will have to react in their accounting to new and forward-looking information as it is received. This means that impairment allowances may increase suddenly and significantly when economic conditions deteriorate, which could have certain pro-cyclical effects.[14] The ESRB report considers a number of policies that could address such effects.  For example, stress testing could be used as a means to gauge the variation in impairment allowances associated with adverse scenarios, in order to ensure that sufficient capital buffers are in place and to allow for remedial policy action if required. If banks can withstand a hypothetical adverse scenario, they would likely be able to cope with the early recognition of expected credit losses under a real downturn, as required by IFRS 9.  Identifying and addressing risks beyond the banking sector Given the bank-based nature of the European economy, the state of the banking sector is central to our assessment of systemic risk. But the financial system is constantly evolving. Since 2008, the assets of the non-bank financial sector in the euro area have roughly doubled and are now slightly larger than those of the banking sector.[15] The path to growth set out in the European Commission’s Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union (CMU) means that the non-bank financial sector is likely to play an increasingly important role in financing the economy.[16] This evolution offers many opportunities: it would provide new sources of funding for business, and it would help increase options for investors and savers.  Yet, as financial intermediation shifts from banks to non-banks, existing risks may migrate and new risks may emerge. It is important, then, to identify such risks and to develop tools to mitigate them.[17]  Take, for example, the issue of interconnectedness between different parts of the financial system. Interconnectedness – be that through direct exposures or indirectly via common or correlated asset holdings – is a natural feature of an integrated financial system. But during times of financial stress, interconnectedness transmits and potentially amplifies shocks, and can lead to contagion. Full visibility is of the essence here.  In this regard, the second EU Shadow Banking Monitor, published by the ESRB earlier this year,[18] analyses a unique data set collected by the EBA. The data show that exposures of EU banks to shadow banking entities amount to over €1 trillion.[19] Focusing on a more granular subset of these exposures, the analysis finds that 60% of EU banks’ exposures to shadow banking entities are to entities domiciled outside the EU.[20] These findings highlight the global and cross-border interconnectedness of the banking and shadow banking systems and the need for international cooperation in monitoring and addressing cross-sectoral risks. Unilateral actions and isolated national attempts are predisposed to fail.  When moving from identifying to addressing risks in the financial system, a number of elements need to work in tandem: good regulation and supervision make individual firms safer; recovery and resolution regimes provide legal certainty when a firm gets into trouble and they ensure that failure is orderly; and macroprudential policy looks beyond individual institutions and deploys tools to target systemic risks.  A recovery and resolution regime is particularly important for central counterparties (CCPs), which have become critical hubs in the financial system. Legislation in this area is progressing, and the ESRB continues to identify areas of refinement to better address macroprudential considerations.[21] This includes the need for cooperation and coordination between resolution authorities for banks and CCPs, as distress of a CCP would typically be triggered by distress in one or more banks that are clearing members of the CCP. Creating a harmonised recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector across the EU is also important. Ordinary insolvency procedures may not always be consistent with policy holder protection and financial stability objectives. This means that they may not suffice to manage the failure of a large insurer or the simultaneous failure of multiple insurers in an orderly fashion. For example, Romania developed a comprehensive recovery and resolution framework of this kind following difficulties faced by two large insurers in 2014 and 2015. And the Netherlands and France are in the process of developing such frameworks after experiencing the near-failure of some financial conglomerates during the global financial crisis.[22]  Addressing systemic risks requires macroprudential tools that public authorities can use. Reflecting this, the ESRB recently noted that there is a need to establish a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit beyond banking, which to date is lacking.[23] Of course, specific tools still need to be developed. The ESRB has done preliminary work assessing what those tools might be. One example is the macroprudential use of margins and haircuts, on which I updated the European Parliament earlier this year.[24], [25]  Conclusion Let me conclude. Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy. At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector.  I hope that when you return to your institutions, this conference will have strengthened your resolve to address the challenges in banking and beyond that are discussed here. On that note, I am pleased to open this second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board.      [1] For example, the most recent stress tests by the European Banking Authority in 2016 included 51 banks from 15 EU and EEA countries, covering around 70% of banking assets in each jurisdiction and across the EU. See European Banking Authority (2016), “2016 EU-wide stress test results”, July.     [2] The ESRB has contributed a macroprudential perspective to these stress tests and developed surveys to consider feedback loops.

What followed was a financial crisis that wreaked havoc on economies around the globe. But it did more than that. The crisis also shattered many beliefs about how the banking system works and how it should be regulated and supervised. There was a time when many people believed that the market could bring about a stable and efficient banking sector on its own. They thought that market forces would ensure banks had sustainable business models that were resilient to the ups and downs of the economy. We now know that this did not turn out so well. In fact, there are three pillars that support a stable banking sector: regulation, supervision and market discipline. The crisis made clear that all of these pillars were in need of some repairs. The good news is that we have come a long way – today, the banking sector rests on more solid foundations than before. But some issues still need to be resolved. Let us briefly look over them, beginning with regulation. Once the crisis had started, everyone agreed that the rulebook needed to be rewritten. And back then, everyone agreed that the revised rulebook needed to be a global one. The crisis clearly demonstrated that banking is a global business, so the rules that govern it should also be global. Today, however, it is much less clear whether everyone still subscribes to the idea of a global rulebook.  And this worries me.  It worries me because it shows that people are starting to forget the lessons we learned from the crisis.  That’s why we need to finalise the global rulebook, Basel III, as quickly as possible. But that is just the first step.  The second step is to implement and apply the rules in a broadly consistent manner at regional and national level. And this is a challenge – sometimes we see quite a different interpretation of the standards when it comes to implementing and applying them at national level. You won’t be surprised that I will focus on the euro area. The euro area countries have become closely intertwined. For many years now they have shared a single market and a single currency. Since the crisis, they have even begun to build a banking union, which includes a single supervisor. But when it comes to regulation, we still see differences between countries. It is true, of course, that we have a single rulebook in Europe. As one might expect for a union, we had to come further than other countries. However, parts of that rulebook come in the form of EU directives. And these still need to be transposed into national law, which explains some of the differences we see. So regulation in the euro area remains fragmented. But this runs counter to the idea of “same business, same risk, same rules”; and it runs counter to the idea of the European banking union. So there is a clear case to be made for further harmonising the rules. We need a well-written rulebook to keep risks in the banking sector in check. But rules are just one of the pillars that support a stable banking sector. The second pillar is supervision. And here we need to strike a delicate balance because these two pillars interact in a subtle way. The general idea is that rules create the foundations for supervisors to do their job. There is a danger, though. If the rulebook becomes too detailed, it might wall supervisors in and limit their options too much, rather than provide them with solid foundations. And this can happen fairly quickly. By way of example, just think of speed limits. Let’s say you want to set a speed limit for motorways. Does 120 kilometres per hour sound about right? At first sight, this is a very simple and straightforward rule. But then you start to think – what if there’s a sharp and dangerous bend in the road? Wouldn’t that call for a lower speed limit? And what if the road becomes slippery when it rains? Perhaps the speed limit should depend on the weather? And shouldn’t it also depend on the kind of vehicle? One could easily think of many more questions like these. So even a seemingly simple rule can quickly start to become more and more complicated.  The world is complex and uncertain, particularly when it comes to finance and banking. That leaves us with two options.  Either we come up with more rules to try to cover every potential situation.  Or we allow supervisors some discretion within a set framework and let them judge specific situations on their merits. In the end, these two options need to be in balance, and we must be careful not to disturb this balance. And here is where I see some cause for concern.  Regulators might be tempted to lay down rules to cover every eventuality – think of the example I just gave you. And their motivation would certainly be laudable. But their goal would be unattainable. It is just not possible to cater for every potential situation. There are too many possibilities, most of which we cannot anticipate. No one knows what financial innovations might emerge; no one knows where technological change will lead us; and no one knows how the economy will evolve over the coming decades. If we try to cover everything, the rulebook will, at some point, become too detailed, too big and too complex. From that point onwards it will stop making the banking sector a safer place and instead create new problems. First, overly complex rules facilitate regulatory arbitrage. Yes, we could add page after page to the rulebook, setting out detailed rules, definitions and thresholds governing how banks should deal with risks and specifying, for instance, which tools supervisors should use in certain situations, and when. But with each new page, more loopholes open up. It becomes easier for banks to game the system. This defeats the purpose of a rulebook and poses a threat to stability. Second, there is the problem of interaction. The more rules there are, the more they can interact and interfere with each other. If there are two rules, there is just one way in which they can interact. If there are 1,000 rules, they can, in theory, interact in at least 500,000 ways. It becomes ever more difficult to foresee the overall effect of the rules, and the danger of unintended side-effects increases.  And third, there is the issue of costs. The thicker the rulebook, the more expensive it becomes for banks to comply with it and for supervisors to do their jobs. These costs are justifiable if each additional rule reduces the risk of another crisis. However, at a certain point the costs of the rules begin to outweigh the benefits. So, instead of having overly detailed rules, we should have a strong basic set of rules that allows supervisors some discretion. .Supervisors have the relevant skills and experience, and in-depth knowledge of the banks they supervise. We should ensure that supervisors can continue to apply their judgement. They should be empowered to assess the risks that a bank poses to its stakeholders and the financial system. This will enable them to deal with risks at an early stage. But if the rulebook becomes too extensive and too detailed, supervision turns into a simple box-ticking exercise. A large, detailed and seemingly comprehensive set of rules would make supervisors less flexible and effective; it would leave no room for discretion. Supervisors would no longer be able to react quickly to newly emerging risks in an ever-changing banking sector. They would be walled in by rules that were devised to cover every possible situation but, in reality, were outdated right from the start. So, looking ahead, we must fight the urge to make the rulebook ever more detailed. But don’t get me wrong – we shouldn’t unwind any of the reforms. What has been done was necessary. But we should be cautious about going too far. A few clear principles can be more effective than 1,000 complex rules. The two pillars of regulation and supervision are equally important and we should not favour one at the other’s expense. And this brings us to the third pillar of a stable banking sector: market discipline. With all this talk about rules and supervision, we must not forget that banks operate in a market economy. So why not use market forces to keep risks in check? There is nothing like the prospect of failure and financial loss to keep a lid on risk-taking. And this, as a general rule, is the essence of market discipline. Investors who stand to lose their own money will be more cautious than investors who can offload losses onto someone else. But, as I said earlier, markets have not always exerted discipline. During the crisis, bank failures were rare. But why? Well, first, there was a lack of tools to resolve failing banks – particularly across borders. And second, there were fears of contagion and a meltdown of the entire financial system. So, in the end, governments often stepped in and propped up failing banks with public funds. There was no chance for the market to impose discipline. This has changed. In Europe, we now have a single resolution mechanism for banks. It was designed to ensure that banks can fail in an orderly manner without damaging the financial system. This new mechanism has recently passed its first series of tests. Generally speaking, it was successful, although some adjustments are still needed. In any case, we have taken a big step towards more market discipline in the European banking sector. To sum up, a stable banking sector is supported by three pillars: regulation, supervision and market discipline. Since the crisis, we have made these three pillars stronger. Now we have to make sure that they remain in good shape and share the load in a balanced way. Otherwise, we will not reap all the benefits of the transformation that has taken place in banking supervision. Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",
      "['2017-09-15', 'Sabine Lautenschläger', 'Monetary policy – what’s next?', 'Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017', '  Monetary policy – what’s next?   Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017 Monetary policy has changed significantly since the financial crisis. For many years we have pursued a highly expansionary monetary policy stance. During that time, monetary policy has also become quite unconventional; we have deployed a range of different non-standard measures. But now, markets, banks and savers are waiting for it to become more conventional again. And there’s no doubt that monetary policy will return to normal. The question is when. That is the first challenge. We need to find the right moment. The conditions are all in place for inflation to reach a stable trend towards our goal: below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. The conditions for that are all in place. Growth has returned to the euro area, and so have jobs. We can look back on 17 quarters of economic growth and an unemployment rate that has fallen from around 12% to around 9%. This has given a boost to demand; people have started spending again. And the recovery is not confined to a few countries; it has taken hold across the euro area. Given all of that, inflation should pick up. And it is picking up, but less quickly than one would expect. So what is holding it back? Well, there are a couple of things – oil and commodity prices, for instance. They suppress headline inflation and make it more volatile. And they also affect core inflation. And there is another issue: the headline unemployment rate seems to miss some of the slack in the labour market. So the economy might be a bit further away from full potential than would appear to be the case at first sight. That, of course, holds inflation down. At the same time, a long period of low inflation has an impact on how wages and prices are set. This is particularly problematic when prices and wages are indexed to inflation. This effect should wash out over time, though. In any case, we can conclude that inflation is taking a bit longer than usual to pick up. So some monetary accommodation is still needed to bring inflation back on a stable trend towards our goal. But to a large extent, this accommodation is being provided by the standard monetary policy measures and by the stock of bonds that we have already bought. So even when we phase out our net purchases of bonds, the accommodation will still remain in place and be sufficient to ensure the necessary support to growth. The buoyant growth coupled with the monetary accommodation will take us back to an inflation rate which is in line with our goal. There’s little doubt about that. Hence, it is time to take a decision now on scaling back our bond purchases at the beginning of next year. And this point leads to a second challenge. We need to think about how to bring our unconventional measures to an end. We need to look ahead and discuss what the exit might look like. I am aware that this requires us to communicate very carefully. On the one hand, we must help markets to get an idea of what the exit will look like. On the other hand, we mustn’t confuse them with vague or ambiguous ideas. It’s a delicate balance we have to strike. And in my view, we need to find this balance now. Thank you for your attention.

      "['2017-09-15', 'Sabine Lautenschläger', 'Banking supervision – is variety really the spice of life?', 'Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017', '  Banking supervision – is variety really the spice of life?   Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017 Variety is the spice of life, they say. But with regard to regulation and supervision, too much spice spoils the dish. Europe has thus opted for less variety and more harmonisation. There is a single European rulebook for banks, there is a single European supervisor and there is a single resolution mechanism. All this helps to make banks safe and sound, and it prepares the ground for a truly European banking sector. But below the surface, things are less harmonised. I will just mention three things in this context. The first thing is the legal basis. The single rulebook is less single than the name implies. Parts of it are have been implemented through EU Directives which provide huge incentives to add as much national spice as possible. The rulebook also contains a number of options and discretions. These offer some leeway in applying the rules. As European banking supervisors, we have agreed to exercise many of these options and discretions in a harmonised manner. Still, there are some which lie in the hands of governments – these too need to be harmonised. The second thing is the scope of supervision. There are very good reasons for supervising specific types of entity at European level. However, these entities are still subject to national supervision and national regulation. The most obvious examples are large investment firms with cross-border, bank-like activities and third-country branches of non-EU banks. In the wake of Brexit, many banks will decide to relocate from the United Kingdom to the euro area. And they might choose to set up third-country branches. At the same time, investment firms might also relocate. So I think it would make sense to regulate and supervise them at European level. The third thing is the supervisors’ toolbox. There are tools which are available in some countries but not in others. The moratorium tool is one example. It is crucial for handling bank failures in a safe way; so it should become part of a harmonised European toolbox. To sum up, in my view, there is still too much variety. To put it another way, there are too many differences when it comes to regulation and supervision in Europe. Such diversity can only be justified when it reflects country-specific risks. And that is not always the case. So if we are serious about the banking union, we must strive for more harmonisation. Thank you for your attention.  ']\n",

By now, and contrary to these stories, we have seen that pro-European policies can garner political support. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that Euroscepticism is receding and that trust in the EU and the euro continue to increase.  At the same time, the economic and financial situation in the euro area has improved considerably in the last years: since early 2015, euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter with an average of 1.9\\xa0% in annualised terms; more than six million jobs have been created since the recovery began in the last quarter of 2013; employment has surpassed its pre-crisis peak of early 2008. Nevertheless, there is still considerable slack in a number of euro area countries which are burdened with high unemployment. Stock imbalances also remain in other areas, such as the level of NPLs in the euro area banking sector, or the large negative net international investment positions in countries that in the years prior to the crisis were running high current account deficits. Thus, there is a clear need for further action. The favourable economic as well as political environment present a unique window of opportunity to fix the shortcomings of our economic and monetary union and relaunch the Eurozone – as the title of this session suggests. The June 2015 Five Presidents’ report presented the outline of a roadmap to that effect; the European Commission’s reflection paper on the deepening of EMU further developed the contours of a roadmap. Before going into the specifics, let me make a few more general remarks. Learning from history - strengthening the Union Let us not forget that the EU is a union of Member States but it also has to be a union of European citizens. Their elected representatives at the European level and the Union institutions should drive the agenda on the future of the EU, not a few Member States. As much as I welcome a Franco-German initiative to revive the debate on EMU deepening, this should not become an alternative or parallel process that might come at the expense of other, in particular smaller Member States. History teaches us that European integration has been most successful when it was based on the community method, not intergovernmentalism. This is because it allows all Member States to commonly share sovereignty in a democratic, transparent and inclusive manner.  Speaking as a central banker of a genuinely European, you might even say federal institution, let me elaborate further on this institutional point. We should avoid entertaining the illusion that competences have been effectively transferred to the European level, even if this may be de jure the case, when they are still largely de facto controlled at the national level. This risks creating confusion among citizens who are legitimately asking for effective policies that address their needs.  On the contrary, if we want to progress along the path of further European integration, there needs to be alignment of sovereignty and responsibility on the one hand and legitimacy and accountability on the other hand. In other words, where competences are given to the European level, they should be part of the Union framework, with clear institutional independence, instruments to accomplish the responsibilities transferred, full democratic accountability and judicial control. For me, the single monetary policy framework put in place and enacted in the EU Treaties provides a fine example to that effect. Europe seems less effective in areas were competencies are shared between the Union and the national level, even in cases where the Union is imposing a rule-based framework. Europe is even less effective in areas where the intergovernmental approach is indefinitely preferred over the Union method.  Financial and economic priorities Let me be more concrete now on what I consider to be the EMU deepening priorities:   Financial Union: Completing the Capital Markets Union (CMU) and Banking Union should be among our top priorities. They are each other’s natural complements. Both a genuine CMU and a true Banking Union not just support a homogenous and smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, but they ensure that savings are allocated in the most efficient way to productive use in the form of investment across the area, regardless of their national location. In creating an ever more robust financial integration, we will facilitate private risk-sharing which will help to make our economy more resilient to shocks and we will become less reliant on public risk sharing to do this job. In particular Banking Union must not be left unfinished, given the importance of the banking sector in the financing of the euro area economy. A single currency for all euro area citizens needs to be complemented by a single banking system so that ‘a euro is a euro’ is the shared conviction of everyone holding it in his pocket or in a bank deposit.  Fiscal and economic governance: While the economic governance framework has been strengthened in response to the crisis, we see that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) are insufficiently delivering on guiding countries to implement comprehensive structural reforms and to live up to fiscal policy recommendations. The implementation of the country-specific recommendations is poor, to say the least. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the rules is thus essential, also to build confidence and trust for further steps in terms of sovereignty sharing.  At the same time, other European instruments can also be of help in providing carrots, not just sticks. For example, the instruments of the Single Market are not yet used to their full potential in the field of economic policies also to induce further reform momentum. Technical support from the European level, for example through the Commission’s Structural Reforms Support Program, can also support reform efforts. And the EU budget can play a role – albeit in a limited way - in providing public goods to EU citizens.  A euro area fiscal capacity with own resources managed at the central level could undoubtedly do much more, in particular to pursue union-wide macroeconomic stabilisation goals, by offering funding to member countries hit by external shocks for purposes that would otherwise remain unfunded. Public investment funding offers a good example, when looking at what crisis-hit euro area countries did in the earlier years of this decade. There can be no question that such a pooling of resources requires sufficient economic convergence among participating countries and effective borrowing constraints at the Member State level. This begs the question of how to design this convergence process. The key challenge will be how to create a conditionality architecture that supports reforms while setting the right incentives in order to avoid the creation of a transfer union. But it would be a fallacy to believe that an intergovernmental approach could do a better job at this than the Community method. Building coalitions of the ‘willing’ to make progress in this direction would in my view also be the wrong approach.  Of course, a euro area fiscal instrument will require adequate institutional backing which in turn might necessitate a change to the Treaties. The appetite for such an endeavour has been notoriously low for many years. However, the fear of Treaty change should not deter us from discussing what is necessary to put our Economic and Monetary Union on a more solid footing. I remain convinced that European nations and citizens are willing to share more sovereignty in policy areas where national member states are increasingly less able to tackle the challenges on their own. But citizens rightly ask for a concrete roadmap in which policy fields sovereignty need to be shared and how such powers at the central level are controlled and legitimised. Once we have convincing answers to these questions, Treaty change will lose its trepidation.  ']\n",
      "['2017-09-13', 'Peter Praet', 'Karl-Otto Pöhl Lecture', 'Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2017', '  Karl-Otto Pöhl Lecture   Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 13 September 2017 The monetary policy measures introduced by the ECB since June 2014 have played a pivotal role in supporting the economy and have proven to be effective in preventing a period of disinflation from degenerating into one of outright deflation. More than three years on, the risks of deflation have largely disappeared and the transmission of our policy measures to the real economy is clearly demonstrated by a broad-based recovery with solid momentum. This is a pre-condition for inflation returning to the medium-term objective that the Governing Council identified almost 15 years ago as its preferred definition of price stability.  Before turning to price dynamics and monetary policy, let me say a bit more about the latest economic developments. Real GDP in the euro area has expanded for 17 consecutive quarters, growing by 2.3% year-on-year during the second quarter of 2017, according to Eurostat – and surpassing our projection at the start of the year. This compares with the latest potential growth estimates for the euro area of just over 1%.[1] The latest survey data point to a strong start to the third quarter. The composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index – which is highly correlated with growth in the euro area – is above its long-term average and remains close to six-year highs. The forward-looking components of the survey continue to point to growth in the quarters ahead. Moreover, Eurostat’s economic sentiment indicator is at a ten-year high. A distinctive feature of the ongoing recovery is that it has led to tangible employment gains. Since hitting a trough in mid-2013, the number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7 million. As a result, all of the employment losses recorded during the crisis have been offset. The unemployment rate is also continuing to fall, despite an increase in labour force participation, and is now at its lowest level in eight years.  Employment growth, together with the gradual increase in employee compensation, is supporting households’ disposable income and underpinning solid consumption dynamics. Buoyant sentiment, favourable bank lending conditions and the notable progress achieved with respect to deleveraging are all conducive to robust consumer spending. The investment outlook is also positive, supported not only by a need to modernise the capital stock after years of subdued investment and an improving outlook for profitability, but also by highly accommodative financing conditions as our policy measures have passed through financial markets to affect the borrowing conditions of businesses and their customers.  Since June 2014, bank lending rates for euro area non-financial corporations have fallen by almost 120 basis points, and for households by over 100 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by almost 190 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area. Heterogeneity of lending rates across countries has also fallen sharply. For example, the difference between the average lending rate for firms in countries that were severely affected by the crisis versus other countries has narrowed by about 100 basis points over this three-year period. The pass-through of monetary policy has become more even and less distorting.  These positive developments have been further supported by the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which have led to banks passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers.[2]  The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, as recent surveys have shown.[3] Moreover, bank lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. According to the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, covering the period from October 2016 to March 2017, euro area SMEs have continued to signal improvements in the availability of bank loans. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016. Against the backdrop of this substantial easing of financing conditions, domestic demand has become the mainstay of growth in the euro area, making the recovery more resilient to developments overseas. The latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections point to robust private consumption and a continued recovery in investment over the period ahead. Real GDP growth is projected to remain well above potential growth and to average between 1.7% and 2.2% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced: on the upside, the current cyclical momentum could result in stronger than expected growth, while the remaining downside risks relate primarily to global factors and developments in the exchange rate. From today’s point of view, the strength and resilience of the recovery tends to boost our confidence that reflationary forces will gradually support headline inflation returning towards a level that is below, but close to, 2%. But it’s too soon to claim victory: inflation dynamics remain subdued. After hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last year and stood at 1.5% in August according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. Owing to energy-related base effects, headline inflation rates are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year. Looking further ahead, headline inflation, according to our latest staff projections, is expected to remain clearly below a level that is consistent with our inflation aim over the next two years, averaging 1.5% in 2019. Furthermore, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Some measures of underlying inflation – which relates more to domestic price pressures – have ticked up moderately in recent months. For example, HICP inflation excluding food and energy, which in August was 1.3% for the second consecutive month, has surpassed the 1% level where it had been languishing for around three years. Nevertheless, underlying inflation pressures are yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend.  An important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued is muted wage dynamics, which are shaped by many factors. Besides weak productivity developments, the significant degree of remaining labour market slack acts to contain wage growth. When assessing slack, it is also worth looking at alternative measures of unemployment. The so-called U6 measure captures unemployment, underemployment (meaning workers who would like to work more hours) and marginal attachment, namely those workers who are not competing very actively in the labour market, for example because they are not available to start a new job at short notice. Labour market slack measured in this way currently affects around 18% of the euro area extended labour force and is thus considerably higher than the headline unemployment rate. [4]  We are undoubtedly experiencing a solid, broad-based and resilient economic recovery that is contributing to a narrowing of the output and unemployment gaps, but a seeming disconnect between growth and inflation remains. As slack in the economy continues to be absorbed, reflationary forces will gradually build up and the traditional Phillips curve connection between inflation and the business cycle should eventually re-assert itself.  Recent empirical evidence suggests the Phillips curve has flattened since the period preceding the global financial crisis. There are two polar interpretations of this development. The weakening of the relationship between inflation and economic slack could be attributed to a mismeasurement of slack, owing to structural changes in the labour market. But there could be a less benign interpretation too. Lower estimates of the slope of the Phillips curve could also stem from parallel shifts in the curve. If such shifts result from sustained disinflationary developments unmooring inflation expectations, they raise significant concerns. It is our duty, as a central bank, to ensure that the Phillips curve reasserts itself at a steady rate of inflation that is in line with our medium-term objective of below, but close to, 2%. Our mission is not yet accomplished and we must remain patient and persistent.  Patience is required for inflationary pressures to show through convincingly in the data. The euro area’s economic environment is improving, and the negative tail risks to inflation expectations, which were so visible at the start of our asset purchase programme, have virtually disappeared. But measured inflation rates are exceedingly volatile and metrics of underlying price pressures remain anaemic. The entire distribution of inflation expectations still needs to shift a fair distance to the right. We must also be persistent with the use of our policy instruments to ensure a durable and self-sustained return of inflation towards a level that is below, but close to, 2% over a meaningful medium-term horizon. The baseline scenario for inflation going forward remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance.  Therefore, maintaining a steady hand continues to be critical to fostering a durable convergence of inflation towards our monetary policy objective.

Similar workshops have become a regular part of our annual conference schedule here at the ECB for almost ten years now. They keep offering novel insights and help to deepen our understanding on the transmission and optimal conduct of non-standard measures. This workshop was no exception. In my concluding remarks, I will share personal takeaways regarding some of the non-standard measures deployed by the ECB since the beginning of the global financial crisis. These policies include the provision of liquidity on demand at fixed rate full allotment since October 2008; facilities to provide medium-term liquidity to banks against collateral in a series of long-term refinancing operations (LTROs); the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme; the use of forward guidance in our monetary policy communication as well as the large-scale asset purchase programme (APP) and the use of negative interest rates. The workshop papers provide a rich set of analysis relevant for many of these non-standard measures that I will refer to in my remarks.  Credit easing programmes Banks play a predominant role in the euro area financial system, so it was particularly important to support banks’ credit provision after the turbulence caused by the global financial crisis. Research on the bank lending channel and the effectiveness of our credit easing programme is particularly welcome and was well represented at our workshop. Let me briefly review two contributions with particular relevance for the euro area: The paper by Boeckx and co-authors studies the response of bank lending to firms to credit easing measures. They find a positive effect for the most constrained banks, provided that they have a sufficiently high capital buffer. Poorly capitalised banks do not respond to the credit support measures. These findings underscore the interactions between prudential regulation and monetary policy and gives further justification for setting up the SSM and the regular stress testing exercise, ultimately serving not only financial stability but also the effectiveness of euro area monetary policy. The paper by Cahn and co-authors is on the effects of the Additional Credit Claim (ACC) framework, decided on 8 December 2011, to address bank funding concerns in several euro area countries. Credit claims are loans that banks can pledge as collateral with the ECB to obtain liquidity in our refinancing operations. As you may recall, at the end of 2011 we decided to offer the euro area banking sector two additional LTROs with a maturity of 3 years and an interest rate as low as 1 percent, fixed over the maturity of the operation. But that alone would not have been sufficient. Banks also needed collateral to access the operations. While overall collateral buffers were sufficient, the distribution of eligible collateral between banks was highly uneven. The ACC framework comes into play here. It allowed NCBs to temporarily accept an expanded list of credit claims as collateral in their refinancing operations. Specific risk mitigation measures were put in place to keep the overall risk of the collateral pool unchanged. I interpret the results of Cahn and co-authors as supportive for our decision in December 2011. The paper shows that the ACC made a crucial difference for banks’ lending behaviour. SMEs that were previously served by only one bank, i.e. the part of firms most vulnerable to a tightening of credit, benefitted the most from the introduction of the ACC framework. The findings clearly show the importance for policy makers to understand the constraints under which lending decisions are being made; although collateral appeared to be sufficient when we launched the 3-year LTROS. Without ACCs, many firms would not have benefitted from the liquidity injection. Besides the bank lending channel, our credit easing policies also influenced the euro area economy through the exchange rate channel. The nominal exchange rate is one of the asset prices that we pay particular attention to because of its impact on the inflation rate. Dedola and co-authors (2016) document the effectiveness of our balance sheet policies on the exchange rate and their transmission to prices and economic activity in a careful empirical analysis. It is notable that the authors find significant exchange rate effects predominantly emanating from a reduction in international financial distortions achieved by our liquidity policies. It is an open question whether their results will change were they to redo their exercise in a follow-up study for APP-related balance sheet changes. For this exercise to be feasible, further data points are however needed. The Outright Monetary Transactions Programme By mid-2012, the global financial crisis had morphed into a sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. In stressed countries, interest rate spreads had grown excessively and monetary conditions became tight despite the easy stance of monetary policy. The problem was a liquidity crisis: a general distrust among market participants about the future ability of distressed sovereigns to roll over their debt. The crisis had self-fulfilling features: under low interest rates sovereigns were solvent, but the high interest rates demanded by market participants and the ensuing deterioration of the economic outlook indeed threatened the sustainability of some of the stressed sovereigns.  The OMT programme was designed to diffuse such tensions. It offers conditional liquidity insurance by promising outright purchases of sovereign bonds with maturities up to 3 years on the condition that the countries meet domestic economic conditions laid out by an agreement with the European Stability Mechanism. The credibility and the potential ‘fire-power’ of the ECB have made the programme successful. Without actually spending one euro to this day, the programme has contributed to the steep decline of sovereign spreads by as much as 2 percentage points. The evidence analysed by ECB researchers in Altavilla, Giannone and Lenza (2016), suggests that this helped ensure a more uniform transmission of our exceptionally easy interest rate policy and led to substantial increases in credit growth, activity and prices in stressed countries, with some positive spill-overs to core countries.  These events and the success of the different policy actions have drawn renewed attention to the relevance of macroeconomic frameworks that can help us understand situations with multiple equilibria and devise appropriate policy responses. I am encouraged to see new quantitative macroeconomic models incorporating such frameworks,[1] some with the help of ECB researchers, and see some potential for future policy-relevant research in this area.  Forward guidance  Let me now turn to the most “standard” instrument in the central bankers’ toolkit of non-standard measures: “forward guidance” about the future conduct of monetary policy. Its emphasis is on the management of expectations, as opposed to the current setting of a monetary policy instrument. Most frequently it has been related to the future course of policy rates, but the ECB also provides forward guidance in relation to its asset purchases. In fact, ECB’s forward guidance currently links the lift-off date for interest rates to the end of net asset purchases by stating that “we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels […] well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.” The effectiveness of forward guidance is however, a hotly debated topic, both in academia and in policy circles. In standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, forward guidance is extremely effective, under the usual assumptions of forward-looking rational expectations, coupled with the central bank’s ability to commit to future actions. So much so that the lower bound on nominal interest rates in these models becomes a trivial constraint: the central bank can maintain the full effectiveness of monetary policy by setting an appropriate future lift-off date. This is a consequence of the models assuming that consumer behaviour is determined by standard Euler equations that impose a strong present impact on consumption resulting from the future behaviour of interest rates. However, economists and policy makers around the world including myself, are much more sceptical about the power of forward guidance alone to deliver stable macroeconomic outcomes in relation to the predictions of the standard models. This became known in the literature as the “forward guidance puzzle” (a term coined by Del Negro, Giannoni, and Patterson, 2015). Naturally, forward guidance helps but it certainly does not possess the powerful grip on the economy that it shows in the standard theory. Furthermore, its marginal effectiveness is certainly not increasing as the central bank extends the lift-off date further in the future. Therefore, an effort to amend the standard theory is needed, and I am very glad that some of the papers presented at this conference address this very issue.  At this point in time, there is a wealth of approaches to solve the problem created in DSGE models.[2] Among these, I find the solutions of McKay and co-authors (2016) and Gabaix (2015 and 2016) particularly useful. Heterogeneous agents, credit constraints and precautionary savings limit the reaction of consumers to future interest rate movements. Gabaix introduces behavioural agents with myopic capacity to perfectly anticipate the future, a hypothesis reflected in a discounted Euler equation that avoids the “forward guidance puzzle” and illustrates the advantages of considering shorter horizons implied by behavioural cognitive impairments.  The approach of Angeletos and Lian (2016) is also promising.[3] It relaxes the assumption of ‘common knowledge,’ which typically goes hand in hand with the assumption of rational expectations. The paper points out that the puzzlingly strong effects of forward guidance arise through general equilibrium mechanisms, such as the feedback loop between aggregate spending and inflation. Assuming a lack of common knowledge attenuates the general equilibrium effects. Sufficiently strong information frictions qualitatively solve the forward guidance puzzle through anchoring the response of expectations to changes in policy. This is clearly another intuitive and welcome development in the theory of monetary macroeconomics.  What do these findings imply for the practice of forward guidance? As policy makers, we know that many of the conditions that the standard models presuppose are often not met in practice. We are also acutely aware of the challenges that arise when attempting to effectively communicate the conditionality of promises on the future path of interest rates. We understand the advantages of a consistent and clear communication strategy – indeed, inconsistent or vague promises about the future course of monetary policy often introduce additional noise and raise rather than reduce economic uncertainty. My answer therefore is that we will continue using forward guidance to some extent, but knowing that it is an imperfect tool and therefore only as one of the various non-standard measures that we can activate when deemed necessary. Large Scale Asset Purchases Large-scale asset purchases, especially purchases of sovereign bonds since early 2015, have been one of our most salient non-standard measures in the euro area. The Eurosystem has already purchased more than 2 trillion euros of public and private assets and we intend to purchase assets at a monthly pace of 60 billion euros until December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim. The programme was instrumental in eliminating deflation risks, contributes to the ongoing recovery and helps us bring inflation closer towards our objective.  The APP in the euro area has drawn attention to particular transmission channels of large-scale asset purchases over and above the standard portfolio rebalancing and signalling channels.  Another classic channel through which the programme exerts its influence is the so-called ‘duration channel,’ which also appeared in multiple papers presented at the workshop. According to this view, the public-sector purchase programme can best be understood as a swap of long-term sovereign debt for short-term – actually overnight – central bank deposits by the Eurosystem. This swap influences asset prices because the central bank eliminates duration risk from the private market. Suggestive evidence on this channel in action in the euro area was described in Altavilla and co-authors (2015). The ECB researchers analysed the intraday development of government bond prices during the January 2015 press conference, when the details of the programme were announced. Surveys conducted before the announcement suggested that market participants expected the maximum maturity of eligible assets to be around 10 years. Instead, the eligible assets included bonds with maturities up to 30 years. The researchers could separately identify the impact of this duration surprise, because its announcement came somewhat later than the announcement of the overall size of the purchases, (which was also somewhat larger than expected). They confirmed that the duration announcement reduced yields all across the maturity spectrum – and not just for assets with maturities over 10 years – in line with the predictions of the duration channel. The paper by De Graeve and his co-author (2016) presented at this workshop confirms, for the United States, that reducing the outstanding maturity of sovereign debt through asset purchases does indeed reduce long-term interest rates. This is consistent with recent euro area observations. Their paper also draws attention to an important condition for the effectiveness of a public-sector purchase programme: governments’ maturity policy should not undo the impact of the maturity reduction through increasing the relative supply of long-term government bonds. U.S. evidence cautioned about this effect: Greenwood and co-authors (2014) estimated that the Treasury’s active maturity extension programme offset around one-third of the duration supply impact of Quantitative Easing (QE) between 2007 and 2014. Early euro area evidence suggests comparable numbers. ECB researchers in Andrade and co-authors (2016) find that during the period when APP reduced the ten-year equivalent government supply in the euro area by 4.5 percent of GDP, euro area treasuries increased it by around 1.9 percent. So they could have offset around 40 percent of the impact. This requires further monitoring, and points to the importance of co-ordination with national treasuries.  I would also like to use this opportunity to draw your attention to ongoing modelling work at the ECB. We are working to incorporate financial frictions and an effective asset purchase programme into our euro area wide structural macroeconomic model, the New Area-Wide Model (Coenen and co-authors, 2017). Similar efforts apply to the New Multi-Country Model that is now being developed and includes a more granular treatment of the financial sector. The New Area-Wide Model aims to take into account the importance of bank-based financing in the euro area as well as the importance of open economy considerations. The estimated model finds a relevant role for both financial imperfections and shocks emanating from the financial sector in explaining business cycle fluctuations and propagation in the euro area. The APP is effective in the framework, because the central bank can temporarily improve the balance sheet constraints of financial intermediaries, which then leads to better credit conditions, improving the economic outlook and raising the inflation rate. The ensuing lower term premium, furthermore, depreciates the exchange rate to satisfy an arbitrage condition between the local and foreign long-term sovereign debt markets. This exchange rate channel increases consumer prices, with marginal impact on output, not unlike those identified by Dedola and co-authors (2017). This new version of the framework will continue to help us form a consistent view about conjunctural developments and will be applied to analyse the quantitative impact of alternative policy scenarios.  So what have I learned about QE programmes and specifically the APP? A key question is how large a balance sheet the ECB should maintain in the long-term. This issue is broader than just the question about a possible “permanent QE” addressed in the paper by Harrison (2017) from the perspective of its contribution, to a reduction in the frequency of zero lower bound episodes. He concludes that the contribution would be small and therefore dismisses the case for what he calls “permanent QE”.  The debate about the size of the central banks’ balance sheets however, refers mainly to other objectives. In the 2016 Jackson Hole Symposium, two papers by Duffie and Krishnamurthy and by Greenwood, Hanson and Stein,[4] stressed the importance of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Reverse Repurchase agreement Programme (RRP) through which it repos against cash securities on its balance sheet. The first group of authors advocate the continued use of this programme in order to involve more counterparties and to affect several interest rates beyond the overnight rate, thereby contributing to a better transmission of monetary policy. The decline in size and importance of the unsecured interbank money market affects the pass-through to other maturities.  A second set of objectives relates to central banks keeping a large balance sheet as a way to steer the supply of safe assets, particularly through the same RPP, to create very short-term safe assets. This fosters greater financial stability by avoiding unsuccessful private sector attempts in fulfilling that role and amplifying risks in financial markets as seen before the crisis. This is an important issue as the attempt to create safer private assets was behind the expansion of a shadow banking sector that played a significant role in the crisis.[5]  Finally, a third objective was recently expressed by the President of the New York FED[6] that it would be justified to keep a balance sheet with a sufficient size in order to enable the use of bank reserves’ remuneration and the RRP as ways to steer short-term rates, instead of using open market operations only as was previously the case.  In the euro area, some similarities regarding the transmission via the unsecured interbank market may justify in the future, reflections on these new aspects of conducting monetary policy. Meanwhile, the predominantly bank-based nature of the European financial system allows us the possibility of going back to a “leaner” balance sheet, with lending to banks remaining the main channel for managing liquidity and steering short-term interest rates. Asset purchase programmes would be in any case a potential tool to be applied again in future contingencies, if necessary.  Negative interest rates The ECB was the first major central bank to introduce negative policy rates. The rate of the ECB’s deposit facility was lowered to -10bps in June 2014 and reached -0.40bps in March 2016. Negative rates stimulate the economy via the usual channels: they lower\\xa0real\\xa0yields and bank lending rates at various maturities, encouraging borrowing and real activity. In this context, negative policy rates have been an effective tool in the euro area, lowering not only short-term rates but also rates at longer maturities via expectations. I agree with both keynote speakers in our workshop that the transmission of rate cuts in negative territory may be different from conventional rate cuts. Let me briefly outline why.  While banks enjoy valuation gains on securities they hold on their balance sheet, as with any other rate cut, they may face a squeeze in their interest rate margin in the future for their loans, new and/or old, depending on whether the loans are fixed or floating rates. Such a loan margin squeeze may occur because a significant part of banks’ funding costs is unlikely to fully reflect the central bank’s move to negative rates: for a variety of reasons, banks’ retail deposits are essentially floored at zero, as was also emphasised in the keynote speech by Eggertsson. If banks cannot adjust the rates they pay their customers for their deposits as a reaction to falling loan rates, their profitability could decrease, leading to lower bank equity which in turn, could lead to lower lending, potentially hindering the pass-through of policy. This mechanism points to the importance of banks’ balance sheet structures for the transmission of negative rates: banks’ with large securities holdings and relatively small retail deposit shares are more likely to benefit from negative rates than are banks with relatively small securities holdings and a higher retail deposit share.  Work conducted by ECB economists, Demiralp and co-authors (2017), explores this exact point. They identify banks’ exposure to negative rates by their exposure to excess liquidity conditional on each banks’ business model and find that banks have reacted to negative interest rates by granting more loans, reducing their reliance on wholesale funding and by acquiring non-domestic government bonds. Interestingly, banks classified as investment banks, i.e. those with largest securities holdings and smallest retail deposit share are the one most active in granting more loans. Overall, Demiralp and co-authors (2017) conclude that negative rates have led to a more expansionary stance of monetary policy as well as an empowerment of the ECB’s APP, as banks’ desire to adjust their balance sheets has contributed to lowering interest rates in financial markets.  Similar findings were reported by Basten and Mariathasan at this workshop in their paper on the impact of negative rates on banks in Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) introduced negative rates in December 2014 and lowered rates to a record low of -0.75bps in January 2015. The paper by Basten and Mariathasan (2016) is a very welcome contribution to the emerging literature on the effect of negative rates in that it uses a very detailed dataset, notably comprising supervisory data and a convincing identification, constructed around the institutional specificities of the implementation of negative rates in Switzerland. This puts the authors in a position to answer a variety of questions regarding the impact of negative rates on Swiss banks. Just like Demiralp and co-authors (2017), they find that negative rates have been overall expansionary. With the help of their comprehensive dataset, they are able to point out that banks have been able to more than offset the compression of their interest rate margin by lending to customers formerly not served. This expansion is in line with the predictions of the risk taking channel of monetary policy and in line with what Heider and co-authors (2017) find in the case of the syndicated loan market in the euro area. At the same time, I do not challenge the view that there can be an effective lower bound, or a reversal rate, as it was called by Brunnermeier in his work with Koby, under which an interest rate cut would turn contractionary. However, where this lower-bound lies is still unknown, we have every reason to believe that it is still below the current rates in the euro area or in Switzerland. Once this lower bound is reached, however, perverse outcomes may materialise because the interest rate cut does not reach retail bank deposit holders as Eggertson pointed out. I share these concerns: negative rates are a tool that needs to be closely monitored. We are happy with the experience and we think the evidence accumulated so far points to the negative side effects being dominated by the positive aspects of the policy, which means that this is a new instrument in the central banks’ toolkit to be used in exceptional circumstances. Conclusions Let me conclude. The non-standard measures that the ECB had to use in order to face the challenges of the crisis and the threat of too low inflation have been successful to avoid the worst for the European Monetary Union. From innovative liquidity facilities to asset purchase programmes and negative deposit rates, non-standard measures proved crucial to avoid deflation and foster the economic recovery. We have not yet achieved our main goal of inflation being below but close to 2 percent. We share with other advanced economies the puzzle of wage and prices not responding to strong growth as usual. By keeping a sufficient degree of monetary policy accommodation we can be confident that our goal will eventually be reached, in accordance with our mandate.. I thank the presenters, the discussants, the organisers and the audience for this successful workshop. Non-standard measures are going to be part of our toolkit for some time to come, and some of them might even be deemed standard measures at some point, so I can promise you that we will continue to organise similar events. I am looking forward to seeing further contributions on the ongoing debates, further analysis on the potential costs of non-standard measures and new results related to relevant questions like the impact of non-standard measures on inequality that I recently addressed.[7] I look forward to your future work to foster our understanding of the non-standard times that continue to challenge all of us.

      "['2017-09-11', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'The transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy in standard and non-standard times', 'Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the workshop “Monetary policy in non-standard times”, Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2017', '  The transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy in standard and non-standard times   Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the workshop “Monetary policy in non-standard times”, Frankfurt am Main, 11 September 2017 Monetary policy has had a powerful impact on financial markets in recent years.[1] There is compelling international evidence that non-standard policy measures, such as asset purchases, forward guidance and negative interest rates, have been successful in altering relative asset prices in a way that is consistent with the predictions of portfolio rebalancing theory and the signalling channel of monetary policy.[2] Few therefore dispute that the first stage of transmission of non-standard policy measures to the financing conditions of the private sector has been effective. Since the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates is expected to prevail more often in the future, this is undoubtedly good news. The situation is less clear, however, when it comes to the second and third stages of transmission – that is, from easier financial conditions to economic activity and from economic activity to prices. Many central bank observers point to continued anaemic growth and low inflation across the globe and conclude that unconventional policy measures have failed to stimulate the economy. If this were the case, it would place a question mark over the use of such measures.  In my remarks this morning I would like to examine this claim more closely. In doing so, I will focus on two prime channels underlying the second stage of transmission: the exchange rate channel and the real interest rate channel. My remarks will therefore be neither exhaustive nor complete, given that monetary policy can affect the economy through many other channels as well, such as its impact on the valuation of equities and, hence, on firms’ cost of capital and investment decisions, Tobin’s q in short.[3] Another channel of relevance is the bank lending channel as formalised by Bernanke and Gertler (1995). But by focusing on the exchange rate and interest rate channels, we can get a good understanding of how effective recent policy measures have been. In particular, I will show that monetary policy-induced exchange rate movements may have considerable impact on consumer prices, but that this relationship depends on the state of the economy and the shocks driving it, much in line with the recent literature in this field. And I will show that the New Keynesian Investment and Savings (IS) curve is alive and well in the euro area – that is, aggregate demand responds to changes in real ex ante interest rates, and can also be shown to have done so in recent times, provided it is measured properly. A state-dependent exchange rate pass-through Let me start with the exchange rate channel – a channel that has been heavily debated in recent months in the light of the large movements that we have observed in the foreign exchange market. For example, since the beginning of April the euro has appreciated by around 13% against the US dollar and 7% in nominal effective terms. Textbook economics would suggest that such sizeable changes ought to lower the prices of imported goods and thereby put downward pressure on producer and consumer prices. Slide 1  On the left-hand side of slide 1 you can see that there is indeed a strong correlation between annual changes in the euro’s nominal effective exchange rate and annual extra-euro area import price inflation, here shown for consumer goods excluding food, beverages and tobacco. Simple eyeballing would suggest a pass-through of around 40%, at least following depreciations, a point I will return to later. On the right-hand side you can see that the correlation is already much weaker in the case of the pass-through to producer and consumer prices. No discernible pattern emerges over the past seven years or so.  Of course, the reduced responsiveness at higher stages of the pricing chain in part reflects the fact that imports only account for a fraction of both producers’ overall input costs and final consumption. But the seemingly stubborn resilience of consumer and producer price inflation to the sharp depreciation of the euro in 2014, and the subsequent appreciation in 2015, is nevertheless surprising. After all, based on prevailing estimates in the literature, the net effect of these two opposing exchange rate movements could have lifted HICP excluding energy and unprocessed food inflation – I will refer to this as core inflation from now on – by up to 0.5 percentage point over the course of last year.[4] In other words, such estimates suggest that euro area core inflation in 2016 would have been less than half its actual level if it had not been for the euro’s depreciation in the preceding years.  While this cannot be ruled out in the absence of a reliable counterfactual, it at least invites suspicion, not least as producer price inflation proved equally resilient lately. Recent price developments therefore raise two important questions. First, has the exchange rate pass-through declined over time and, if so, is it a temporary or a more permanent phenomenon. And, second, if it has declined, is this related to the use of non-standard monetary policy measures? My answer to the first question is that, yes, the pass-through is likely to have been lower in recent years, mainly for two reasons.  The first, and more permanent, reason has to do with structural factors unrelated to monetary policy. A large body of the literature illustrates that the exchange rate pass-through depends on factors such as the monetary policy framework, import composition, trade integration, currency invoicing and the rise of global value chains.[5] Broadly speaking, as globalisation has advanced and inflation and inflation volatility have declined, these factors have contributed to progressively reduce the exchange rate pass-through in most developed economies. For example, in the case of the euro area, it has been found that a growing share of local currency pricing has mechanically reduced the pass-through.[6] You can see this on slide 2 for the euro area. Today the pass-through to final consumer price inflation may be less than a third of what it was at the beginning of the century.  Slide 2    The second reason is more cyclical in nature. It relates to the state of the economy and the response of monetary policy to it. The theory is that exporters will not set their prices as a constant mark-up over costs, but will adjust them to expected changes in their future marginal costs and demand prospects. The implication is that what ultimately matters for the exchange rate pass-through is the type of shock that is hitting the economy. This notion goes back at least to Corsetti and Dedola (2005) but has received more prominence lately following the work of Kristin Forbes and co-authors (2015).[7]  Slide 3    On the left-hand side of slide 3 you can see initial evidence to support this claim. ECB staff find that less than half of the euro’s exchange rate variations vis-à-vis the US dollar over the past almost 20 years was purely exogenous.[8] More often than not, exchange rates move in response to changes in relative demand, supply or monetary policy. And each of these shocks might entail a different response from domestic prices. This you can see on the right-hand side. What this chart shows you is that there are occasions when euro area core inflation rises, rather than falls, following an exchange rate appreciation – which is entirely at odds with our traditional thinking on the pass-through. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is typically the case when the exchange rate appreciates in response to a favourable demand shock. The logic is as follows: as the economy operates above capacity, inflationary pressures emerge that are sufficient to fully offset the disinflationary effects coming from the exchange rate channel.  The chart also shows that changes in the relative monetary policy stance have, on average, the expected impact on consumer prices: if euro area policy tightens, the exchange rate appreciates and inflation falls. In other words, there is no empirical evidence that the exchange rate channel of monetary policy is inactive.  But its strength will critically depend on the overall state of the economy, and not on the type of policy measure, standard or non-standard. This is my answer to the second question and can best be seen by looking at two concrete examples.  Slide 4  The first one relates to the sharp depreciation of the euro in the run-up to the announcement of the APP. As you can see on slide 4, a simple model-based analysis suggests that a large fraction of the decline in the euro’s external value reflected the worsening economic outlook, to which we ultimately reacted. It is likely that exporters to the euro area, faced with falling euro area demand, absorbed part of the exchange rate movement in their mark-ups to protect their market shares, thereby mitigating the upward pressure on prices stemming from a weaker currency.  The second example relates to the current situation. Slide 4 shows that there are three forces, of roughly equal strength, that help to explain the euro’s marked appreciation in recent months: improved euro area growth prospects, an exogenous component and a tightening in the relative monetary policy stance vis-à-vis the United States. Slide 5     Slide 5 illustrates the implications of this shock decomposition for the assessment of the exchange rate pass-through. The black line, which is the net effect, suggests relatively mild downward pressure on core inflation, much below what the rule of thumb would tend to suggest, despite the sizeable appreciation.  The reason is simple. The current solid economic expansion in the euro area allows firms that export to the euro area to increase prices in their currency without losing market share, thereby mitigating, once again, the pass-through. So, exporters to the euro area are now able to recoup part of the margins they compressed during the downturn. The extent to which they are able to do so also depends on the degree of competition, a point made by Rudi Dornbusch back in 1987. The more concentrated market power is, and the less substitutable products are, the more likely firms are to increase their margins following exchange rate appreciations. This also means that the pass-through may well differ across industries.[9]  These examples demonstrate that it is by and large the state of the economy that will determine the strength of the pass-through. Monetary policy, for its part, is likely to influence the pass-through predominantly through its impact on the economy itself.  And at the moment this support from monetary policy may be even more powerful than in the past. The reason is that, in the class of models used here, positive demand shocks are normally identified by assuming that short-term interest rates rise in response to higher growth and inflation.  At the current juncture, however, the policy-relevant horizon – the “medium term” concept in our monetary policy strategy – is likely to be longer given the persistence of subdued inflationary pressures. Our forward guidance on both policy rates and the APP, as reiterated by the Governing Council last Thursday, reflects this assessment. This means that, compared with past demand shocks, policy will remain more accommodative for longer, thereby likely muting further the pass-through of any growth-driven exchange rate appreciation. And with the current recovery in the euro area being largely driven by domestic demand, euro strength may also have less of an impact on growth than, for example, after the Great Financial Crisis. All of this suggests, therefore, that monetary policy never acts in isolation on the exchange rate and that, in periods of recovery, the positive confidence and stimulus effects of monetary policy are likely to offset, at least in part, the disinflationary effects of a stronger currency coming from expectations of tighter policy. Slide 6    Of course, this also means that should the contributions of the different shocks driving the exchange rate change over time, then also our assessment of the impact on inflation will have to change – expansion or not. Exogenous shocks to the exchange rate, if persistent, can lead to an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions with undesirable consequences for the inflation outlook. As shown on slide 6, the emerging disconnect between the euro’s exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar and the long term interest rate differential between the US and Germany may suggest that we are entering such a situation. Against this background, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring. The New Keynesian IS curve in the euro area This brings me to the second channel I would like to discuss this morning: the effects of monetary policy on real economic activity.  Much of our attention recently has been focused on the properties of the Phillips curve – that it may be flatter, non-linear or mis-specified in terms of the relevant economic slack. By now, we are fairly confident that non-linearities and broader labour market slack are likely to explain much of the weakness in inflation as of late.[10]  Some observers have interpreted the lack of stronger price pressures as a failure of monetary policy to stimulate the economy. They argue that persistently low inflation is testimony to the ineffectiveness of non-standard policy measures. If this were true, then also the reasoning behind the shock-based exchange rate pass-through would in part be misguided.  I would argue, however, that such claims reflect a serious misunderstanding and simplification of how monetary policy works. There are very few instances, such as through the exchange rate, where policy can directly affect prices. In most cases monetary policy transmits to prices through its impact on the intertemporal allocation of consumption, savings and investment. If prices are slow to adjust, a cut in the key policy rate lowers the real interest rate, which, in turn, stimulates interest-sensitive spending. In other words, if we want to see if policy works or not, or if the economy has become less sensitive to changes in interest rates, then we should examine the slope of the IS curve, and not only of the Phillips curve.[11]  Empirical research on the IS curve is scarce, however. And the few studies available are generally not encouraging from a monetary policy perspective. They typically find that output does not respond, in a statistically significant way, to the real interest rate.[12] Often they even find a positive relationship between real interest rates and output. These findings are at best disturbing given that much of mainstream monetary thinking is built on the idea that firms and households take the level of the interest rate into account when making economic decisions. Slide 7    To illustrate the empirical failure of the IS curve, slide 7, column 1, shows the estimated coefficients of a regression of the euro area output gap on its own lag and a measure of the real “interest rate gap”, i.e. the difference between the real ex ante interest rate and the time-varying natural rate. Except for the fact that output is not forward-looking – I will come to this in a minute – this is a standard New Keynesian IS curve where the output gap is based on estimates by the European Commission, the short-term interest rate is the three-month Euribor, expected inflation is taken from the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the natural rate is taken from the euro area estimates by Holston, Laubach and Williams (2016).  Clearly, the real interest rate gap is not statistically significant at any reasonable confidence level. This finding holds true if we use actual ex post inflation – specification 2 – instead of expected inflation, or if we include the real interest rate per se, and not as a deviation from the natural rate, as is sometimes suggested, as in specification 3.  The financial crisis and the use of non-standard policy measures do not seem to explain the puzzle either: the real interest rate remains insignificant if we restrict the sample to the period before the outbreak of the crisis, specification 4, or if we take the euro area shadow rate as estimated by Wu and Xia (2016) – specification 5 – a measure that attempts to mimic the joint effects of unconventional policy measures at the zero-lower bound.  What I would argue, however, is that the short-term interest rate is not the appropriate measure to use in an empirical IS curve. In a bank-based economy, such as the euro area, the short-term interest rate may simply not be sufficient to characterise the monetary policy stance and, hence, the financial conditions ultimately determining the decisions by households and firms. The imperfect substitutability between market-based financing and bank loans was already recognised by Modigliani (1963) and later refined by Bernanke and Blinder (1988). Indeed, it is enough to recall the period after the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis, and the associated financial fragmentation, to see that the interbank market rate is a biased measure of the financing conditions facing the private sector.[13] In other words, unless there is a perfect transmission from changes in short-term rates to the ultimately relevant borrowing rates, estimates using the former will yield inconclusive results.  This conjecture is also supported by the data. In specification 6 we replaced the short-term interest rate with a measure of the composite bank-based cost of borrowing for non-financial firms. If we use this measure instead, the real ex ante interest gap in our IS curve has the expected sign and becomes statistically significant at the 10% level: a 1 percentage point reduction in the gap increases output by 0.13 percentage point.  The interest rate channel becomes even more powerful once we estimate a New Keynesian IS-curve that is closer to first principles – that is, one that is also forward-looking in output, as in specification 7. For this purpose, we add to the equation the expected real GDP growth rate six quarters ahead, as collected by the ECB’s SPF.  As in previous findings in the literature, output appears to be strongly forward-looking. But the thing to note is that the real interest rate gap is now significant at the 1% level, suggesting an increase in output by 0.3 percentage point following a 1 percentage point drop in the real rate gap. There is also no evidence that output might have become less sensitive to changes in real bank lending rates with the advent of non-standard measures: although the sample is naturally small, and estimates might therefore be biased, specification 8 illustrates that the coefficients remain unchanged when we estimate the same forward-looking IS curve for a sample starting with the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010.  In other words, these estimates would suggest that about a quarter of the reduction in the output gap that we have observed since the introduction of our credit easing measures in June 2014 can be directly explained by the impact of our measures on bank lending rates, even after controlling for the indirect positive impact on expected inflation.[14] These estimates are very close to other internal ECB staff estimates, using more sophisticated term structure and general equilibrium models, of the impact of our measures on economic growth.[15]  So, monetary policy is far from being ineffective in stimulating aggregate demand, also when approaching the effective lower bound. The fact that inflation remains subdued rather reflects constraints operating at the third stage of transmission – from activity to prices – that are often outside the control of monetary policy. Before I conclude I would like to illustrate one last point. Bank lending rates are without doubt a key variable in explaining output movements in the euro area. The evidence I provided today further emphasises this point. At the same time, the financial conditions that are ultimately relevant for firms and households may be broader than that. One of them – the exchange rate – I discussed in more detail earlier in my remarks.[16] Other factors may include equity prices or long-term interest rates that are often relevant for household mortgages.[17]  One way to summarise these factors is to use financial conditions indexes (FCIs). My colleague Peter Praet gave a detailed speech on such indices earlier this year, which I strongly recommend reading.[18] Here I would like to focus on the relevance of these broad measures for economic activity.  As you can see in column 9 of slide 7, FCIs are highly statistically significant when used in a New Keynesian IS curve. This is unlikely to be a statistical artefact. It is rather further evidence that we cannot reduce our analysis of the impact of monetary policy to a simple short-term rate as has typically been done in the academic literature so far.[19]  The question then is no longer which financial variable to use in estimations, but how to weigh them to reflect any varying impact they may have on output and, ultimately, inflation. For example, my last specification on slide 7 uses an FCI that attributes a much larger weight to the exchange rate, in line with the rule of thumb I mentioned earlier, which suggested a strong pass-through to inflation. Interestingly, this FCI fits the data less well, and is just about significant at the 10% level, which might support the view that the exchange rate pass-through could be lower than what such a rule of thumb would suggest.  But as I explained earlier, even a lower weight on the exchange rate would likely not fully capture the relative importance of the various financial variables at each point in time. That is, if the impact of changes in financial conditions on inflation depends on the state of the economy, then ideally FCIs would be based on time-varying weights. This is food for thought for future research.  Conclusion With this in mind, let me conclude.  The negative relationship between the real interest rate gap and economic activity as posited by Wicksell back in 1898 is a mainstay of modern central banking. This relationship has not been lost with the advent of unconventional monetary policy measures. By easing market-based financial conditions, and by putting downward pressure on the real interest rate that banks charge to borrowers, central banks can stimulate aggregate demand, even when short-term interest rates approach the effective lower bound.  The validity of this relationship is also crucial for assessing the price effects of monetary policy-induced movements of the exchange rate. With policy being effective in boosting growth, any disinflationary effect of a stronger currency arising from expectations of a tighter future monetary policy stance might be mitigated, or offset, by the ensuing improvement in the economic outlook. However, exogenous shocks to the exchange rate, if persistent, can lead to an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions with undesirable consequences for the inflation outlook.  Thank you.

[10] See e.g. Cœuré (2017) and Draghi (2017).     [11] Phillips curve estimates are often partial equilibrium in nature, building on single equation specifications. Of course, because output and pricing decisions are taken simultaneously, both the IS and the Phillips curve are equally relevant and should therefore ideally be analysed in a general equilibrium model, such as in Smets and Wouters (2007).     [12] See e.g. Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2004), Stracca (2017) and references therein.     [13] See also Al-Eyd and Pelin Berkmen (2013) and Blattner and Swarbrick (2017).     [14] The real bank rate gap has fallen by around 1.6 percentage point since the second quarter of 2014. The output gap has fallen by around 2.1 percentage point over the same period.     [15] See, e.g., Draghi (2015).     [16] In empirical open economy extensions of the New Keynesian model, the exchange rate appears as an additional variable in the IS curve (see e.g. Ball, 1998, and Svensson, 2000).     [17] Fuhrer and Moore (1995) show that the correlation between short-term rates and output reflected the fact that the statistical properties of the short rate were similar to that of the long rate, which should ultimately matter for aggregate demand.     [18] See Praet (2017).     [19] This is similar in spirit to the findings of Meltzer (1999) and Goodhart and Hofmann (2005) that changes in the real monetary base exert separate effects on aggregate demand and that the addition of other asset prices can explain the real interest rate puzzle.

Today and tomorrow we will discuss matters that are relevant not just to the ECB and the legal community, but also to the public. The legal order indeed has a direct impact on all our daily lives.  And it is of crucial importance to what we do at the ECB. With the ratification of the EU Treaties, the citizens of Europe made us independent and gave us a clear mandate. So it is entirely legitimate that we are held to account. We need to be able to show that we continue to act in accordance with our mandate; we do not need to enter into a contentious debate about changing it.  In fact, the demand for accountability has been increasing across advanced economies and across institutions. It’s a trend that reflects questions stemming from the crisis as well as societal and technological change – people want more answers, more quickly. But we need to be mindful that direct, instant and constant communication does not necessarily translate into stronger accountability. In our constitutional democracies, parliaments and courts provide fundamental checks and balances, for good reasons. The increased attention and stronger scrutiny we are facing at the ECB also reflects the growing importance and more direct impact of decisions taken at European level. Citizens in Europe witness the power exercised by EU institutions – and they want to be able to see that it is not wielded arbitrarily or from behind closed doors.  Today, I will discuss how these trends are affecting the ECB. And I will aim to draw some conclusions on how to align accountability with sovereignty in the EU’s multilevel governance framework at a time when, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey[1], 68% of those polled say they feel they are citizens of the EU as well as citizens of their own country.  Independent, accountable and European The survey shows that trust in the ECB has increased, albeit from a lower level than trust in other public institutions. Still, during the crisis, reduced trust in public institutions tempted some people to reopen the debate on central bank independence. They often argued that independence was incompatible with accountability on the basis of the trends I have described. A critical assessment of why trust in public institutions fell is important, but questioning central bank independence is not the right approach – subjecting central banks to political influence is unlikely to make them more trusted. We know the economic argument – empirical evidence shows that political influence is more likely to lead to short-termism and make the central bank less effective in preserving price stability. But there is also a political argument – political influence does not necessarily mean stronger legitimacy, precisely because it is likely to arouse the suspicion that the central bank is politically motivated and may therefore deviate from its mandate for political reasons. So I would argue that independence does not weaken accountability, it strengthens it. Accountability, in turn, ensures that independence does not lead to arbitrariness and that the mandate is fulfilled. So, proper accountability arrangements strengthen the case for independence. And they reinforce each other as cornerstones of central banks’ legitimacy and effectiveness.  At the ECB, our monetary policy mandate is for the euro area as a whole. And when the governors of the national central banks (NCBs) attend the Governing Council meetings, they are not representing their respective countries. They are there in a personal capacity and represent the interests of everyone in the euro area. So it is appropriate that we are held to account at European level, while the NCBs explain monetary policy decisions at national level. Importantly, explaining decisions is not synonymous with exercising accountability. In principle, where a competence, such as monetary policy, has been fully transferred to European level, accountability should be practised at that level. This ensures that everyone in Europe has the same ability to hold us accountable through the same bodies, namely the European Parliament, complemented by judicial review by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In other words, a single monetary policy requires single accountability, but in a multinational setting it can be explained through various channels.  Attempting to strengthen political ties to national political systems, “renationalising” accountability through the back door, if you will, would only risk undermining the singleness of monetary policy and threaten its independence. People and markets would end up suspecting that the ECB is responding to national interests instead of acting in the interests of the euro area as a whole. Accountability during crises Central banks played a key role in managing the crisis and implemented some controversial measures. Understandably, this triggered a demand for stronger scrutiny. The ECB was among the institutions that took such measures: preserving price stability was particularly challenging in an Economic and Monetary Union that was still incomplete. We were facing doubts about the integrity of the single currency, not to mention a unique institutional environment that lacked crisis management capacities. We increased our accountability and transparency in line with the essential role we played in managing the crisis. And this was not only driven by external demands. It was in our own interest to provide the public and the markets with a comprehensive analysis of the economic situation and monetary policy decisions. For instance, we decided to publish the accounts of the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings. Of course, this higher level of transparency had to be counterbalanced by the need to maintain the frank and dynamic exchanges which make for efficient collegial decision-making. The accounts offer a fair and balanced reflection of policy deliberations by Governing Council members. They aim to provide clear and accurate information that elucidates the message, rather than overloads it with detail. However, there is a caveat: the growing importance of forward guidance has increased the risk of self-censorship in the official discussions.  Since the start of the crisis we have substantially increased our interaction with the European Parliament, our key counterpart in terms of accountability. In addition to the regular hearings, the ECB now participates in exchanges of views. The number of MEPs’ written questions to the ECB has also considerably increased; the average number of replies to the Parliament per year has risen tenfold compared with the pre-crisis period. This is partly a reflection of the fact that we now have a broader role, albeit mostly in relation to financial assistance programmes and banking supervision.  Alongside this increased accountability, the CJEU has become more involved in judicial review of our actions in recent years. On the one hand, the Court has exercised its powers in relation to a wide range of central bank decisions and policies. Recent cases have seen it review not only monetary policy and supervisory decisions, but also technical advice provided within the framework of the Troika and central banking policies, even where they do not involve the exercise of our decision-making powers. On the other hand, the Court’s decisions have far-reaching implications, as recent rulings have confirmed that individuals can also challenge our conduct by seeking damages, in addition to asking the Court to annul our decisions for reasons of illegality. We need to ensure that all our actions, even when we are not exercising our core decision-making powers, also comply with the legal requirements that are intended to confer fundamental rights on individuals at EU rather than national level. The European Ombudsman and the European Court of Auditors also play a role. The Ombudsman can act in matters involving the ECB regarding transparency and good governance, while the Court of Auditors examines our operational efficiency. The European Anti-Fraud Office has the power to conduct administrative investigations within the ECB for the purposes of fighting fraud, corruption and other illegal activity, as well as to investigate serious matters relating to the discharge of officials’ professional duties. Finally, we are also subject to the scrutiny of the European Data Protection Supervisor, which monitors and ensures that data protection legislation is appropriately applied to our data-processing operations. Aligning accountability with sovereignty in the EU The ECB’s monetary policy provides an example of how sovereignty and accountability can – and, ideally, should – be aligned when transferring a competence to European level. It also shows that it is possible to keep pace with events and meet the demand for greater accountability from society, while respecting essential principles enshrined in primary law.  However, there are two challenges in this regard that I would like to discuss as they also have broader relevance for the EU, with its unique institutional framework. First, the distinction between the euro area and the EU means that it is more difficult to fully tailor accountability to euro area tasks. In particular, the European Parliament does not sit in euro area composition when discussing euro area matters, even though it would be common sense for it to do so.  Second, accountability and sovereignty also need to be proportionate in areas that are not exclusively dealt with at EU level but of shared competence. For instance, more specific arrangements within our accountability framework have been established for banking supervision. Although the SSM Regulation and interinstitutional arrangements focus mainly on relations with the European Parliament and the EU Council, the SSM Regulation also provides for specific reporting requirements to national parliaments. This reflects the significant potential impact of microprudential supervision on banks, their customers and public finances at national level and justifies ad hoc reporting at different levels. At the same time, the national competent authorities remain accountable at national level for their tasks in the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. These arrangements are, however, incomplete as the Single Resolution Mechanism backstop is not operational, and neither is the European deposit insurance scheme.  For other bodies, such as the European Stability Mechanism, the situation is somewhat more complex and blurred. It was created on the basis of intergovernmental arrangements and for tasks where the EU only has a coordination role, and where the European Parliament is not yet a counterparty in terms of accountability. So a balance needs to be found. On the one hand, accountability should be assigned to national parliaments for decisions that are fully in the hands of national authorities. On the other hand, it would seem appropriate for the European Parliament to be accountable for decisions that affect the interests of the EU as a whole. Addressing the risk of an “accountability deficit” Let me conclude. Accountability and sovereignty need to be aligned to address risks of a perceived “accountability deficit”.  The development of the ECB’s accountability practices has ensured continued effective scrutiny, even as our role expanded as a result of the crisis. In turn, this has allowed the temptation of renationalisation to be resisted, in keeping with our European mandate.  Public opinion surveys suggest that Euroscepticism is now receding. But we should not be complacent, as trust in the ECB is only gradually returning. Moreover, while European policies have assumed a stronger role over time, in many areas they still overlap with national policies. In those areas, confusion over the assignment of responsibilities and accountability arrangements threatens efficiency and legitimacy. We should reflect on how it can be addressed.  And there is a need for us to complete not only the banking union, but also the institutional set-up. This includes the ongoing debate on a euro area finance ministry and a euro area composition of the European Parliament.  This is important for two reasons. First, it would be a true reflection of a functioning democracy where sovereignty has been either fully transferred to EU level (e.g. monetary policy) or is shared between national and EU levels (e.g. prudential policies). And second, liability and control need to be aligned – he who pays the piper calls the tune. When taxpayers’ money is involved at European level, a European control function is called for. If, going beyond the Westphalian paradigm, EU citizens can receive rights and obligations not only through the national sovereignty channel but also directly through the EU channel, we need to adjust the institutions. This was already recognised at the Maastricht Treaty conference on political union in 1990. On a final note, let me just add that the return to intergovernmentalism for fear of Treaty changes will destroy the EU, as Europe, over the centuries, has repeatedly seen the breakdown of such alliances of dominant states. Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to the many fruitful discussions and exchanges we will no doubt have at this conference.     [1] Standard Eurobarometer 87    ']\n",
      "['2017-09-01', 'Vítor Constâncio', 'Growth, adjustment and resilience in the euro area', 'Remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Forum Villa d’Este, Cernobbio, 1 September 2017', '  Growth, adjustment and resilience in the euro area   Remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Forum Villa d’Este, Cernobbio, 1 September 2017 In my remarks today, I will reflect on the outlook for growth in the euro area taking distance from monetary policy considerations at the present time by focusing on recent economic developments and their structural component. I will then elaborate on opportunities and risks posed by broad structural developments across euro area countries.  In my intervention today, I want to convey five main messages: First, the ongoing cyclical recovery in the euro area is now broader and more consolidated. Second, this notwithstanding, the strong worldwide reflationary phase that seemed likely at the beginning of the year has not materialised. Therefore, the tasks of normalising inflation and unemployment to acceptable levels continue to be difficult. Third, the euro area peripheral countries have completed a notable adjustment phase. Consequently, the monetary union is now more resilient to shocks as a result of a reduction in imbalances and stronger synchronisation of the economic cycle across countries. The euro area is thus better prepared to resist financial market shocks.  Fourth, in this context, a correction in the worldwide risk premia, particularly in the bond market seems now more absorbable. Financial conditions may nevertheless deteriorate suddenly, due to developments in the US or emerging economies’ or to geo-political risks that can trigger spikes in a situation of prolonged low volatility.  Fifth, resuming real economic convergence among member countries is vital for the euro area. This is the next fundamental challenge and it will require more structural and institutional reforms both at national and European levels. A broader and more consolidated recovery The euro area has now been expanding for 17 consecutive quarters while business confidence is at a decade high. Equally important, practically all countries are now taking part in the recovery and more people in the euro area are employed today than before the crisis. These developments would not have materialised without the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy after the second recession in 2012-2013. While we can be increasingly confident about the sustainability of the recovery, we have to recognise that it has taken much longer for the euro area than for other advanced economies, to emerge from the financial crisis which started in 2008.  The depth and length of the euro area crisis unveiled inter alia the incompleteness of the euro area’s institutional design. However, on the positive side, it has also encouraged the euro area to equip itself with new instruments to tackle these weaknesses.  Indeed, significant reforms have been adopted since 2010 to increase the resilience of the euro area. At the European level, the revamp of the Stability and Growth Pact and the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) strengthened the fiscal framework and the crisis management capacity with a permanent funding instrument. Moreover, the decision to establish the Banking Union in 2012 has put in place the basis for a supranational supervision and crisis management. Also at country level, steps were taken to correct macroeconomic imbalances, including through the implementation of structural reforms. These measures have put the euro area on a more resilient and safer footing and we have started to see the pay-off: countries with previously large current account deficits now record surpluses, competitiveness has improved and the impact of reforms on growth starts to be visible in some countries. At the same time, these positive developments should not lead to complacency as crucial challenges remain in an environment of low trend growth and still high debt levels in a number of euro area countries. To address these challenges we need to continue to make progress at national and European levels. At the national level, the reform momentum needs to be maintained while at the European level, further steps need to be taken to complete the institutional architecture.  Let me start by reviewing a few facts on the euro area recovery and on the adjustment process during the past years.  The euro area has been on a recovery path during the past four years (see slide 1, chart on the left) with the recovery gaining momentum as of late. The euro area has finally reached a GDP level above the 2007 level, recovering the output lost over the period 2008-2013. On the other hand, stronger growth was coupled with increased convergence of growth rates in the euro area, as shown by the development of the cross-country standard deviation of annual real GDP growth over time (see slide 1, chart on the right).     Slide 1  Over recent quarters, the economic recovery has also become more broad-based across euro area countries and the different sectors of the economy. All euro area countries are currently recording positive real GDP growth in annual terms, for the first time since 2007 (see slide 2, chart on the left). At the same time, growth rates have become less dispersed across countries compared to the past, which also suggests increased business cycle synchronisation within the euro area. The recovery is also broadening across sectors. The share of sectors with positive growth has returned to its pre-crisis levels (see slide 2, chart on the right). At the same time, the dispersion of growth rates across sectors is the lowest since the inception of the euro.  Taken together, the broadening of the recovery across countries and sectors suggests that it has not only gained momentum but, importantly, the recovery has gained robustness.     Slide 2  A more robust recovery has also been visible in the labour market where conditions have improved markedly (see slide 3, chart on the left). Employment has risen by almost 6 million since 2013. This stands in contrast to the jobless recovery of 2010, which is another indication of the turning tides in the euro area.  Furthermore, labour market recovery is stronger in countries where it was especially weak. Euro area unemployment rate has receded, despite still too high unemployment rates in some countries (see slide 3, chart on the right).     Slide 3  Notwithstanding these improvements, the growing uncertainty surrounding the strength of the world economic recovery, and of the US in particular, makes the normalisation of inflation and unemployment levels in the euro area more difficult (see slide 4).     Slide 4  Adjustment and resilience The increased robustness of the euro area economy is also reflected in the gradual unwinding of the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated before the crisis. In fact, countries that eventually entered a programme had recorded large losses in price competitiveness in the run-up to the crisis. Since the crisis, the initial dramatic increases in the real exchange rates of those countries have largely been corrected (see slide 5) along with a marked improvement in price competitiveness. In most programme countries relative unit labour costs are now below their respective level in 1999.     Slide 5  At the same time, the large current account deficits registered in several euro area countries before the crisis have narrowed significantly or even turned into surpluses (see slide 6). Importantly, the largest part of the current account adjustments is estimated to be non-cyclical and therefore likely to be sustained as the recovery continues.[1] From this perspective, it is very relevant that (with the exception of Greece) the external account improvements were also a consequence of dynamic export growth and not just resulting from import compression due to the recessionary period.      Slide 6  The impressive correction of current account deficits in some euro area countries has been mirrored in a significant adjustment of intra-euro area trade and current account imbalances (see slide 7). As a result, some euro area countries with large external surpluses now record current account surpluses mostly vis-à-vis countries outside the euro area.     Slide 7  Fiscal deficits have been reduced. Fiscal effort, measured as the change in the structural primary balance, has been significant in many countries (see slide 8, chart on the left). As a result, and also thanks to the reduction in interest payments, fiscal deficits are now in almost all countries below 3% of GDP (see slide 8, chart on the right).      Slide 8  Beyond fiscal deficits, the level of public and private debt has also posed concerns in some countries. In the run-up to the crisis, it was not so much public debt but rather the private sector indebtedness that increased substantially (see slide 9). This should be underlined because, as Jordà, Schularik and Taylor (2016) said: “…private credit booms, not public borrowing or the level of public debt, tend to be the main precursors of financial instability in industrial countries.” [2]  It was only after the crisis that public debt increased, on account of the necessary interventions. More recently, both public and private sector debt levels stabilised, thanks to consolidation efforts and private sector deleveraging, even if remaining rather diverse across countries. Focusing on the programme and post programme countries, private debt levels in percent of GDP are currently lower than 10 years ago in Spain, Portugal and Greece, but still higher in Cyprus and Ireland. Public debt however is higher than at the start of the crisis, across the euro area. Increasing the growth potential of euro area economies would help to achieve a downward shift in the debt-to-GDP ratios.     Slide 9  Synchronisation of economic cycles and symmetric shocks An important aspect stemming from the theory of optimal currency areas, relates to the risk of asymmetric shocks to countries in a monetary union, placing them in different phases of the economic cycle, which would make a single monetary policy inadequate for a smooth functioning of the union. This concern was in everyone’s mind when the EMU was being conceived. In 1992, Bayoumi and Eichengreen published a well-known paper,[3] using data from 1963 to 1988 to calculate the correlation of demand and supply shocks of each potential EMU member with Germany, which represented the core of the union in terms of size and level of development. The analysis clearly identified a core of countries well correlated with Germany and a periphery much less correlated to the centre (see slide 10). They also showed that the difference between core and periphery was bigger than the one among the Federal Reserve Regions in the US.      Slide 10  This analysis raised concern of whether EMU could face the problem of asymmetric shocks thus hampering the single currency performance. Some other authors[4] pointed nevertheless to the fact that synchronisation could be endogenous to the formation of the monetary union itself, meaning that the adjustment to the single monetary policy would lead member countries’ cycles to become more aligned. Interestingly, this is precisely what Bayoumi and Eichengreen found out when conducting the same analysis in 2017, with data from 1990 to 2014. Remarkably, most of the countries (with the exception of Greece) that were previously in the periphery are now more correlated with Germany than some of its own neighbours (see slide 11). From this point of view (synchronisation of cycles) there is now a new core in the euro area to which most of the geographically periphery now belongs.      Slide 11  This is particularly important as a sign of robustness of the euro area, indicating that all countries were able to restore competitiveness within the euro and return to growth thus ensuring a better transmission of the single monetary policy. The euro area is now better prepared to withstand financial market shocks. Future risks and challenges These signs of recovery and resilience should not lead to any complacency towards the future of the euro area. Besides the tasks of normalising inflation and reducing unemployment to more acceptable levels in all countries, many structural and institutional reforms are needed to safeguard and improve the future functioning of the euro area. Both the Five Presidents Report on “Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union” (2015) and the recent EU Commission paper on the “Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union” (2017), provide sufficient guidance on the way to proceed. Next steps include: completing the Banking Union, creating a Capital Markets Union, creating a Macroeconomic Stabilisation function at the euro area level, possibly with a European Treasury and a full European Monetary Fund. These institutional reforms would be crucial for the EMU to face two of the most fundamental objectives to consolidate its future: increase its growth potential and restore a path of real economic convergence among its member countries.  While at present the recovery is on track, looking ahead the growth potential of euro area economies needs to be strengthened. Further efforts thus need to be devoted to strengthening productivity growth which requires an expansion of productive investments. Both the recovery of productivity and that of business investments in the euro area has been lagging behind that of the US (see slide 12).     Slide 12  There have been important reform efforts in the euro area in recent years supporting the recovery of potential growth. Since 2009 the reform responsiveness in the euro area has exceeded the OECD average (see slide 13). In particular, countries which had financial assistance programmes took a number of reforms to improve their resilience and competitiveness, in particular through reforms in product market regulation, employment protection and wage flexibility, and through revamping of active labour market programmes. Many of these reforms are expected to support potential growth but they tend to exert their full impact with a considerable lag. At the same time, the business environment in some of the euro area countries is still well behind that of countries near the frontier, and reform needs are significant.      Slide 13  A final challenge relates to convergence of income levels in the euro area. Gradual but real economic convergence of income per capita across all countries is the ultimate condition for a healthy and consolidated economic and monetary union prepared to resist the test of time. Taking a long-term perspective[5] – from 1960 till today – and focusing on the twelve initial members of the euro area, it is striking that the euro area crisis (2010-13) was the only period when strong divergence materialised in the dispersion of GDP per capita levels.  However, it is since about 1993 – well before the adoption of the euro – that this group of countries does not experience phases of marked income convergence, such as those recorded in the periods 1960-1972 and 1986-1992. The same applies to broader groupings of mature economies in the European Union, such as the Member States which had joined the EU by 1995 (see slide 14). Focusing on the individual euro area countries with the greatest catching-up needs, while some have made significant progress, others have stalled or even reversed their process of real convergence. Such countries are concentrated in the South of Europe, with Greece and Italy being the two most prominent examples.     Slide 14  The re-establishment of a path towards real convergence in the euro area is, therefore, a vital and difficult challenge. Some tentative signs of reversal of the divergence experienced during the euro area crisis are visible since 2014. But more needs to be done, along the lines sketched in the Five Presidents Report and the Commission paper already mentioned. Also crucial in this regard will be the enhancement of countries’ economic structures through improved institutions and governance. Let me conclude. It is clear that the euro area recovery is becoming increasingly robust. The upturn is not only strengthening and broadening, but is also starting to rest on more solid structural foundations. The daunting challenges ahead may still have an existential nature but they can be overcome with time. However, the wise attitude now is not to predict the future but to prepare it.      [1] ECB staff estimate the cyclical and non-cyclical contributions to changes in the current account balance based on an empirical model linking the current account balance to a broad set of cyclical, fundamental and policy variables. A similar exercise, both in terms of methodology and main findings, is undertaken by the IMF in the context of its External Balance Assessment: https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/eba/data.htm.

      "['2017-08-25', 'Mario Draghi', 'Sustaining openness in a dynamic global economy', 'Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Economic Policy Symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, 25 August 2017', '  Sustaining openness in a dynamic global economy    Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Economic Policy Symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, 25 August 2017 The global recovery is firming up. In some countries like the United States, this process has been visible for some years, in others like Europe and Japan, the consolidation of the recovery is at an earlier stage. So it is fitting that our discussions are now focusing not only on how to stabilise the economy, but also on how to make it more dynamic – while at the same time improving people’s welfare. At the centre of this debate is the question of how to raise potential output growth, which has slowed from around 2% in OECD countries in 2000 to around 1% today.[1]  Without stronger potential growth, the cyclical recovery we are now seeing globally will ultimately converge downwards to those slower growth rates. Slower growth will in turn make it harder to work through the debt and demographic challenges facing many advanced economies.  With the population growth rate in those economies projected to slow, the burden of raising potential growth must fall on productivity. There are a number of areas in which domestic policies can encourage an upward shift in productivity growth, such as competition, research and development, and insolvency regimes.  But when thinking about the global economy, one of the key ingredients for raising productivity is openness. Open trade, investment and financial flows play a key role in the diffusion of new technologies across borders that drive forward efficiency improvements.  The social consensus on open markets has, however, been weakening in recent years. This is driven not so much by a belief that open markets no longer create wealth, but by the perception that the collateral effects of openness outweigh its benefits. People are concerned about whether openness is fair, whether it is safe and whether it is equitable.  As Karl Polanyi observed many years ago, if the dislocation created by an open market goes beyond a certain point, protectionism is society’s natural response.[2]  So a central element of efforts to raise productivity growth – and build a dynamic global economy – must involve responding to these concerns about openness. And this is a feat countries cannot accomplish by themselves. Although domestic welfare policies are, of course, essential to the task, a commitment to working together through multilateral institutions is just as important.  This is because fears about fairness, safety and equity ultimately reflect a lack of trust in other countries’ regulation and enforcement. One of the main reasons why multilateral institutions exist is to create regulatory convergence, and therefore to increase trust between countries.[3] And perhaps the most important area where this applies today is global financial sector regulation. Openness as the key to a dynamic global economy One of the key questions facing the global economy is whether the trend towards ever greater economic openness, which has defined the last three decades, is coming to an end. Temporary trade barriers have indeed risen from covering around 1% of products in 2000 to more than 2.5% today, with the crisis accelerating this pattern. The same is true of anti-dumping actions.[4]  That said, at the global level openness is still viewed favourably; three-quarters of people consider growing trade and business ties with other countries to be a positive trend. But those polled in rich countries are more negative than in the pre-crisis period.[5]  Given the established gains of trade, this is plainly a concerning trend for the global economy. International trade results in a more efficient use of production factors and in specialisation where comparative advantage exists, thereby raising productivity growth.[6] And welfare gains from trade for firms and consumers follow from the wider availability of cheaper and better quality products.[7]  Moreover, for advanced economies the importance of trade may actually be growing. As economies converge towards the global technological frontier, innovation becomes more important for sustained productivity growth. And as OECD research has shown, openness to trade is a crucial factor in enabling an economy to benefit from frontier innovation. [8]  According to OECD estimates, in the case of a 2% acceleration in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth in a frontier economy, the productivity spillover will be 0.3 percentage points higher for a country that trades intensively with the frontier economy than for one which trades less intensively. To put this in context, MFP growth has averaged only around 0.5% in OECD countries since 2000.[9]  Thus a turn towards protectionism would pose a serious risk for continued productivity growth and potential growth in the global economy. And this risk is particularly acute in the light of the structural challenges facing advanced economies.  Old-age dependency ratios are rising, putting more pressure on public finances. By 2025 there will be 35\\xa0people aged\\xa065 and over for every 100\\xa0persons of working age in OECD countries, compared with 14 in 1950.[10] At the same time, public debt levels have surged in those countries from 56% of GDP in 2007 to around 87% today.[11] Only higher potential growth can provide a lasting solution.  So, clearly, to foster a dynamic global economy we need to resist protectionist urges. But to do so, we also need to identify how best to respond to protectionism. The role of multilateral cooperation in making openness sustainable Much has been written over the past few years about the negative effects of free trade and the need to pay more attention to those who benefit less from it. The debate has typically focused on the extent to which welfare policies can be used to share the gains of trade more evenly.  Though this is a complex issue,[12] I have no doubt that making better use of public policies to support the more vulnerable members of society, not just financially but also through education and retraining, is a vital part of the equation. More work needs to be done in this area and it is important to learn from best policy practices. But the other key question is: how can we work together to make openness sustainable? What role can multilateral cooperation play towards this goal? This is the angle I would like to address today. Its importance becomes clear when one thinks about the three main areas of concern that people have about open markets that I mentioned earlier. First, there is the concern about whether openness is fair – i.e. whether all are playing by the same rules and applying the same standards. This manifests itself in fears about currency manipulation by trading partners, dumping practices and lack of reciprocal market access.  Second, there is the concern about whether openness is safe – i.e. whether it exposes people to harmful spillovers from abroad. This is perhaps most visible, at least for economists, in the case of cross-border capital flows[13], but it also applies in areas such as agriculture and biotechnology.  Third, there is the concern about whether openness is equitable – that is, whether it disproportionately benefits some groups in society over others. Though it is not straightforward to disentangle the effects of trade and technology on inequality – and they may in fact be linked[14]– the perception that openness contributes to inequality has become more widespread. In each case, multilateral cooperation, leading to regulatory convergence, is a precondition for addressing the underlying causes of these concerns. To demonstrate this, let me draw on our experience of managing openness within the European Union.[15]  As regards fairness, the point is obvious: regulatory convergence provides the strongest assurance that the playing field is level right across the European market. This is why, as borders have opened within Europe, common supranational powers of legislation and enforcement have strengthened in parallel.  For example, the Single European Act in 1986 not only launched the single market, it also substantially extended the powers of the EU to make laws, the role of the European courts to rule on them, and the powers of the Commission to execute them. The logic was that a single market could only be sustainable over time if all participants could be certain that they faced the same rules, and had recourse to the same courts in the case of infractions.  Despite the political events of last year, this symmetry between regulatory convergence and market deepening has, by and large, been a success. In fact, the free movement of people, goods and services within Europe is regularly mentioned in polls as one of the two most positive aspects of the EU, the other being peace among its Member States.[16]  Similarly, what has permitted the Single Market to survive various financial and consumer protection crises is its ability to restore safety by adapting market-wide regulation and enforcement.  To give an illustration, the internal market for frozen foods overcame the mis-selling scandal of 2013, when horsemeat was sold as beef, in large part because it was met with an improved food labelling and EU-wide inspection regime that restored trust. By contrast, a perceived lack of regulatory convergence between the EU and other countries, especially regarding food safety, is one reason for opposition to preferential trade agreements, such as the TTIP.  More fundamentally, following the sovereign debt crisis, the euro area experienced first-hand the risks of a diverging supervisory and regulatory framework for cross-border finance – and faced a serious threat of financial market fragmentation when those flows reversed. Safety was restored by elevating supervision and resolution to the European level with the banking union. This was key to re-establishing trust in the banking system and reviving cross-border capital flows within Europe. These are only the first steps, but the direction of travel has been drawn. When it comes to the effects of openness on equity, it is admittedly less obvious how multilateral cooperation represents a solution to the fears being expressed. As I said, such fears typically have to be addressed by national distributional policies. But there is also an important international dimension, in particular related to tax avoidance.  Indeed, the problem many have with openness is not just that it redistributes income between different social groups. Almost everything that happens in a market economy – skill-biased innovation, churning of firms – redistributes income in some way, and we have in place mechanisms to deal with those outcomes, such as tax systems. Where trade may differ from these other market forces, however, is in the perception that, in Dani Rodrik’s words, it “undercuts the social bargains struck within a nation and embedded in its laws and regulations”.[17] For example, increasing openness to trade and finance is perceived by some to shift the burden of taxation from footloose capital to labour, or to create pressures to reduce labour protections to boost the competitiveness of domestic producers – the “race to the bottom”. Such perceptions, and the sense of injustice they fuel, are deeply damaging to public faith in open markets – and this is where multilateral solutions can play a role.  Addressing tax arbitrage between jurisdictions, for instance, can clearly best be achieved by countries cooperating via international institutions. Likewise, taking a stand against race-to-the-bottom dynamics that threaten labour protections, calls for a common regulatory approach. Again, our experience in Europe offers some insights into how this can work, as well as into some of the difficulties involved.  Thanks to its common legal framework, the EU has successfully upheld labour standards even as its market has expanded to lower-income countries. The Single Market has no doubt prompted some relocation of jobs across countries, and this has at times triggered fears of “social dumping”.[18] But in fact openness has not fundamentally challenged labour protections.  One main reason for this is that safeguards central to the European social model have been progressively embedded in European law, ensuring gradual convergence in labour standards among EU countries. Thus, while there is still heterogeneity, the gap between them is narrowing. Preferences about the degree and type of social and labour protection differ across the world, and I am not claiming that those in the EU should be a model for everybody. The point here is that through multilateral decision-making, the EU has successfully built and defended the single market, addressing the perception that openness is always a source of inequality.  At the same time, in areas where unanimous decision-making is more prevalent, Europe has not always used the potential of its multilateral structure to the same extent. This is the case, for instance, in combatting profit-shifting and tax avoidance, although progress is now being made,[19] which clearly chimes with the mood of EU citizens.[20]  In short, there are certain concerns about equity that can most effectively – and perhaps only – be addressed through multilateral actions. As such, in tandem with well-targeted welfare policies, they are a key part of the policy toolbox for making openness sustainable.  Implications for the global economy Clearly, the European model involves several unique features. In particular, it depends on a relatively advanced political structure that helps reconcile multilateral cooperation with democratic control, which is difficult to replicate elsewhere. Still, EU countries are generally more open than other advanced economies and perhaps have fewer problems of skewed income distribution.[21] So what lessons can we draw for the global economy from our experience? The most salient is that, at a time when disaffection with openness is growing, multilateral institutions become more, not less important. They provide the best platform to address concerns about openness without sacrificing open markets.  So organisations like the WTO, which make sure that trade is governed by rules and is subject to fair arbitration, remain vital to ensuring that global trade is perceived as fair and safe – while at the same time avoiding protectionism in disguise.\\xa0And bodies that foster global cooperation, such as the G20, remain just as necessary to reconcile openness with equity. The OECD/G20 initiative to combat tax base erosion and profit-shifting is just one example of such cooperation. That said – and going by our experience in Europe – the area where we need a special focus today is cross-border finance. Organisations that facilitate convergence in financial regulation and supervision, such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel committees, are key in this context.  Within these committees, a substantial amount of work has been done since the crisis to strengthen microprudential regulation, as well as to design and calibrate macroprudential tools. This work has been essential for at least three reasons. The first reason is that finance is the most mobile production factor, and therefore the most likely to cause dangerous spillovers. This makes convergence in financial regulation one of the most important components of a sustainable open economy.  And we should remember that diverging financial regulation would endanger not only financial openness, but also global trade, since they are often two sides of the same coin: finance and trade are complementary in spreading knowledge and underpinning global value chains. A striking feature of the global financial crisis was indeed the collapse in world trade: between the third quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 global trade volumes declined by approximately 15%. The second reason is that we have only recently witnessed the dangers of financial openness combined with insufficient regulation. International financial flows both contributed to and propagated the global financial crisis and the ensuing collapse of trade, output and employment.  Financial integration only survived relatively unscathed because the global regulatory response was swift and decisive, creating a financial system that posed fewer risks to the world economy. Any reversal would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learnt – and thus whether financial integration can still be considered safe.  Third, financial regulation interacts critically with monetary policy. Lax regulation implies an underestimation by regulators of incentives which lead to behaviour that is individually profitable, but socially costly. Given the large collective costs that we have observed, there is never a good time for lax regulation. But there are times when it is especially inopportune.  Specifically, when monetary policy is accommodative, lax regulation runs the risk of stoking financial imbalances. By contrast, the stronger regulatory regime that we have now has enabled economies to endure a long period of low interest rates without any significant side-effects on financial stability[22], which has been crucial for stabilising demand and inflation worldwide.  With monetary policy globally very expansionary, regulators should be wary of rekindling the incentives that led to the crisis.  To design and agree, in reciprocal trust, a regulation that preserves financial stability without unnecessarily restricting the flow of credit to the economy, while revisiting the post-crisis regulatory framework where necessary, the FSB and the Basel committees remain essential. This is also because, for large economies, changes in domestic regulation have international consequences. Global financial conditions account for 20-40% of the variation in countries’ domestic financial conditions, as shown by recent research from the IMF.[23]  Conclusion Let me conclude. To inject more dynamism into the global economy we need to raise potential output growth, and to do so with ageing societies we need to lift productivity growth. For advanced economies that are close to the technological frontier, this depends crucially on openness to trade. Yet openness to trade is under threat, and this means that policies aimed at answering this backlash are a vital part of the policy mix for dynamic growth. Some of those policies can be implemented domestically, but some can only be effectively enacted through multilateral cooperation. Multilateral cooperation is crucial in responding to concerns about fairness, safety and also equity. By encouraging regulatory convergence, it helps protect people from the unwelcome consequences of openness. And protection ensures that we do not lapse into protectionism over time.  The European experience provides some insights into the opportunities and challenges involved. It also shows the importance of ensuring that, at all times, openness remains under democratic control. Multilateral institutions are necessarily staffed by experts. But it is essential that they always remain accountable to elected representatives who set the parameters and have the final say.

All of you Nobel laureates share the extraordinary ability to explain parts of our everyday reality that have not been understood before, or were previously seen from a different, and less informative, perspective. You are the builders of a science that is also a guide to policymaking. Your discoveries have contributed to the way we think, the way we do policy, the way we affect the welfare of millions of individuals.  This year marks the 200th anniversary of David Ricardo’s Theory of Comparative Advantage[1] – in the words of Paul Samuelson, one of the few counter-intuitive fundamental ideas in economics, which moved the world away from mercantilism. And when we look at other giants in the history of economic thought, Adam Smith, who laid down the foundations of capitalism; Keynes, who drove us into policy activism and away from laissez-faire; until the founders of econometric model building in post-war time, we cannot but conclude that there is little in economics that does not have policy implications and that the interaction between research and its policy application is continuously evolving in an ever expanding universe.  Let me review the most recent development of those interactions and in so doing, I will focus on monetary policy and financial regulation.  The pre-crisis macroeconomic framework  The breakdown in the ability of post-war macroeconomic models to accurately forecast the economic developments of the 1970s and the early 1980s opened up space for further advances in research. Advances that, by and large, provided the foundation of the pre-crisis consensus that inspired central banks in their monetary policy and governments in their stance on financial regulation and supervision. In a very stylised fashion, the range of views that formed this consensus shared three general features. Dominant was the emphasis placed on the interactions between policies and economic agents’ behaviour under rational expectations. Price and wage rigidities were often the only types of rigidity considered in the economy. Finally, financial markets and intermediaries – their regulation, their imperfections, and their supervision – played only a minor role, or were even entirely neglected in macroeconomic models.  It would be a mistake to look back at this considerable body of theory and evidence only with today’s disenchanted, post-crisis eyes and to underestimate the profound changes that it produced in policymaking and institutions.  In the 1970s governments attempted to maximise social welfare, in the form of low unemployment and inflation, by trying to exploit the short-run trade-off between the two. They engineered surprise booms “just once” before promising to revert to a policy of low inflation in future, especially when motivated by the electoral cycle. The insights of a number of Nobel laureates showed how these policies were bound to fail and why they were time inconsistent.[2] The same incentive to renege remains in the future, and promises to do otherwise lack credibility. Rational wage and price setters will not believe in a policy that policymakers will find it optimal to renege on, making it difficult for policymakers to achieve price stability without a recession. It is hard to overestimate the enormous impact that the Lucas critique and the problem of time inconsistency have had on the conduct of monetary policy over the past 40 years. In the 1970s, most central banks were under political control and obliged to follow more or less short-term oriented policies. During the 1990s and 2000s, the importance of credibility was increasingly appreciated and evidence mounted that operationally independent central banks with a clear mandate to maintain price stability delivered much better economic outcomes than those under direct government control.  The result was a revolution in central banking. Today, most countries’ central banks are independent, but subject to a mandate drawn up by the legislators, who in turn hold the central bank to account. As a result of independence and of greater accountability, communication of monetary policy has become much more transparent. The second dominant feature of the paradigm prevailing before the crisis was its focus on nominal wage and price rigidities. Models including these rigidities had greater explanatory power than previous models and were more in line with monetary policy practices at that time. Price stability emerged in both central bank mandates and macroeconomic models as the overriding objective that central banks should pursue in order to maximise social welfare. In the words of an influential article, one could see a “science of monetary policy” developing next to the traditional “art” of monetary policy.[3]  But there was a notable absence of a role for banking and finance in these models. Wage and price rigidities, together with a few other frictions, appeared to be sufficient to provide a realistic characterisation of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the main macroeconomic models. Financial sector developments did not seem to affect this mechanism, because financial intermediation was assumed to be fully efficient. And generally, the interest rates faced by households and businesses typically moved in line with movements in central bank policy rates. True, there were some models that incorporated financial frictions into macroeconomics.[4] Central banks themselves were also aware of the role of monetary and financial markets in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The first Eurosystem Research Network at the ECB studied the so-called bank lending channel, which maintains that banks play a crucial role in the transmission of monetary policy. But the impact of financial frictions was generally estimated to be small in developed countries and these frictions were therefore absent from the canonical models used for monetary policy analysis.  Financial economists of course studied banks and financial markets much more closely, but they used predominantly partial equilibrium models and showed less interest in the way the financial system interacted with the wider economy.  In fact, the pre-crisis paradigm in macroeconomics predicted neither the onset nor the severity of the crisis in any meaningful fashion for the conduct of policy. Unconditional trust in the self-repairing capacities of financial markets, or simple neglect, had led to deregulation and lax supervision in the years preceding the crisis. Low quality capital with little loss-absorbing capacity, underestimation of asset risk, excessive and overlooked leverage, ignorance of the interconnections, disregard for the liquidity buffers, low resilience of the funding markets, and pervasive fraud, especially in the sub-prime sector were just a few of the factors that produced the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. The evolution of the financial and sovereign debt crises As the crisis unfolded, the interbank funding market dried up and credit availability contracted sharply. Annual credit growth to the private sector fell from 9.3% in 2007 Q4 to -2.1% in 2009 Q3 in the United States and from 8.5% to 0.7% in the euro area over the same period. The effect on economic activity was sudden and significant. Between 2008 Q3 and 2009 Q2, GDP declined by 3.6% in the United States and by 4.9% in the euro area. Though the initial effect of credit contraction was similar in the United States and the European Union (EU), its propagation was considerably different owing to the EU’s predominantly bank-based system of financing. The first banks to be hit in 2007 were obviously the ones that invested the most in related financial products that had by then lost much of their value. These banks were mostly located in Germany, France and Netherlands, countries with comparably strong fiscal positions. Then, starting in 2008, it was the turn of several Spanish and Irish banks, which were overexposed to the collapsing domestic real estate market.  Governments across the globe stepped in to shore up their banking systems. The European Commission estimates that in the EU, public sector aid provided in 2008 was around 5% and in 2009 around 9% of EU GDP.[5] The direct net fiscal costs of financial sector support in the United States between 2007 and 2009 are estimated to be at around 5% of GDP.[6]  Up until that point, sovereign debt had been considered as effectively risk free, regardless of the rating of the sovereign. The Greek crisis destroyed that illusion, and induced a general repricing of risk in the EU. This repricing of sovereign and other risks, combined with the drying up of funding markets, in turn affected other countries’ banks which, having little exposure to either toxic financial products or to real estate, had been immune up until that point. Banks in, for example, Italy and Portugal were overly exposed to their fragile sovereigns. The banking crisis morphed into a sovereign debt crisis. In these countries credit contracted even further, aggravating the ongoing recession and further weakening the banking system in a vicious circle.  Fears of potential sovereign default, with likely catastrophic impact on domestic banking sectors, caused interbank lending between countries to dry up and funding markets in the euro area became fragmented along national lines. This threatened the even transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. The interest rates faced by businesses and households – and indeed sovereigns – became increasingly divorced from movements in short-term central bank rates. The crisis that had started as a global crisis was now becoming the crisis of the euro. The financial sector played a significant role in not only propagating but also originating negative shocks to the economy. Financial frictions – largely absent from both the pre-crisis experience of developed economies and the canonical macroeconomic models – had become major drivers of the recession. The resulting crisis prompted academics to reassess existing economic paradigms and policymakers to adjust their frameworks. The rediscovery of the notion that policy may have a role in coordinating private expectations at times of severe uncertainty played a major part in the transition to today’s post-crisis world.  The evolution of economic theory in response to the crisis A number of significant academic contributions during the 1980s had focused on the way optimal individual behaviour could change depending on what individuals expect other private agents to do.[7]  The presence of this interdependence between agents, or as it is called, strategic complementarity, leads to multiple outcomes. Each of these outcomes is a rational equilibrium, but ones that differ in their implications for social welfare. Panic-based bank runs and panic-based sovereign debt crises are examples of policy intervention being needed to avert “bad” outcomes during a financial crisis.  To an extent this is not a new idea for policymakers – central banks have been acting to stave off panic-based runs on banks for centuries. But the financial crisis has shown that severe financial frictions can exacerbate strategic complementarities. Moreover, the financial sector nowadays is much more sizeable relative to the economy, and runs are correspondingly more costly. Advances in the literature have made strides in incorporating these ideas into macroeconomic models, thus to providing a clearer theoretical framework for these types of interventions.[8]  Economic research has also evolved in its thinking of how central banks should respond to an emerging crisis, particularly when their standard monetary policy instrument, typically a short-term interest rate, reaches its effective lower bound. At the lower bound, monetary accommodation cannot be provided through further reductions in short-term interest rates and policy must become non-standard.  One option is to rely on forward guidance, i.e. to promise to keep interest rates low for longer in the future. Such commitments, if credible, lower longer-term interest rates and provide economic stimulus even if the current interest rate remains unchanged.[9] While forward guidance is a useful instrument, recent research has highlighted that its effectiveness can be improved if combined with other non-standard monetary policies.[10]  Research in both academia and in central banks has therefore re-examined alternative monetary policy tools, including so-called quantitative easing (QE) policies. And here the newly developed models with financial frictions have been useful.[11] Earlier studies based on the assumption of frictionless financial markets had concluded that QE is completely ineffective. The renewed focus on financial frictions clarified that this conclusion is unwarranted, once it is recognised that financial intermediaries are subject to leverage constraints.[12] Large-scale asset purchases can ease these constraints and increase investors’ risk-bearing capacity, leading to a portfolio rebalancing towards risky assets and to strengthened lending activity for banks. All in all, research has confirmed that central banks are not powerless at the effective lower bound. Provided they are willing to explore non-standard policy avenues, they can continue pursuing their price stability mandates even in the most adverse circumstances. The evolution of policymaking The policy response by central banks and governments has evolved along the two main lines suggested by research. As short-term interest rates approached the effective lower bound, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic undertook a number of unconventional measures aimed at influencing the whole constellation of rates that are important for the financial decisions taken by households and businesses.  Forward guidance helped guide market expectations of future short-term rates. QE involved direct intervention by central banks in markets through large scale asset purchases to influence the yield curve beyond the very short term. A large body of empirical research has substantiated the success of these policies in supporting the economy and inflation, both in the euro area and in the United States.[13]  But central bank policy moves extended beyond just measures to counteract the impairment of the transmission mechanism caused by financial frictions. The ECB also acted in various ways to prevent self-fulfilling expectations from delivering socially undesirable outcomes by co-ordinating expectations onto “good” outcomes.  One such policy initiative was our lender-of-last-resort intervention during the financial crisis. Revisiting the Bagehot principles set out a century and a half ago in the light of the ongoing crisis,[14] the ECB lent freely to solvent financial institutions against sound collateral, penalised by a haircut. We did so in multiple ways: our liquidity operations moved to a fixed rate full allotment basis with unprecedented maturity of four years, and we widened the eligible collateral accepted in our operations.  The second occasion came later in 2012 when we had to prevent a self-fulfilling bad outcome that threatened to occur as a result of the sovereign debt crisis. Investors had begun pricing redenomination risk into sovereign debt and interbank markets, as they worried about the possible break-up of the euro area.  However, as I said earlier, the pricing of such risk led to a breakdown of money markets, a fragmentation of banking systems along national lines and threatened the unity of monetary policy transmission across the euro area. Moreover, expectations fuelled a vicious cycle. Tightening monetary conditions in countries affected by perceptions of redenomination risk put downward pressure on economic activity, exacerbating the perceived risk. Such moves are a classic example of expectations leading towards an outcome that is non-optimal for social welfare. This is why we announced Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) as an instrument that can support our monetary policy. The idea was for the ECB to purchase the sovereign bonds of countries affected by panic-based redenomination risk. By breaking the link between perceptions and downward pressure on economic activity, OMTs would aid in restoring the proper transmission of monetary policy across the whole euro area and support the recovery.  OMTs were not used. That the ECB had the tool at its disposal was sufficient to anchor expectations at the “good” outcome. Once unwarranted fears of redenomination were removed, sovereign spreads fell and banks were once again able to raise debt and equity funding. This played a vital role in fostering the euro area recovery that is currently under way. Financial Sector Policies The greater awareness of the costs of financial instability and of financial frictions has also resulted in a revamp of financial sector policies.  First, financial sector regulation and supervision are much stricter. The quality of regulatory capital has improved and its quantity has increased. In the euro area, banks have materially bolstered their capital positions, with the average common equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions rising to 13.5% by end-2016 from 7% in 2008.  The establishment of a new stress testing framework lends a further quantitative dimension to the process of ensuring that, even in a pre-defined “stressed scenario”, financial institutions should remain well capitalised and able to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers.  Second, policymakers have acquired new macroprudential tools to mitigate the effect of financial cycles on the economy. Across the globe, authorities have imposed measures such as loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, to reduce the endogenous link between credit and house prices. This new macroprudential approach to regulation aims to safeguard not just the solvency of individual banks but also the systemic integrity of the banking system and its ability to continue providing finance to the non-bank private sector. In addition to the overall global move to stricter regulation, there have been also a number of institutional improvements. In the euro area, banking supervision is now carried out by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, composed of the ECB and the national competent authorities. This has unified the basis on which supervision is carried out. The largest and most significant banks are now supervised directly from Frankfurt, in close partnership with the national authorities. The euro area has also set up the Single Resolution Mechanism to ensure the orderly resolution of failing banks, while at the same time reducing the impact on the taxpayer. Conclusion This account of how policymakers and researchers have interacted in the past ten years shows how indebted the former are to the latter. From my point of view, one can draw five lessons for policymakers. First, sudden shocks often make visible the flaws in our policy frameworks and challenge the explanatory power of existing theories in ways that have been previously overlooked. But analysis conducted by researchers and embraced by policymakers remains essential in designing the policy response.  Second, a policy response that has its foundation in rigorous research is less prone to being impaired by political compromise and easier to explain to the general public. Third, Keynes is often quoted as saying, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” Well, for policymakers, it is not that simple, and research helps us to decide whether a change in the facts deserves a policy response or, as we say, we should look through it. Fourth, when the world changes as it did ten years ago, policies, especially monetary policy, need to be adjusted. Such an adjustment, never easy, requires unprejudiced, honest assessment of the new realities with clear eyes, unencumbered by the defence of previously held paradigms that have lost any explanatory power. Fifth, we must be aware of the gaps that still remain in our knowledge. Our mainstream macroeconomic models still have little to say, for instance, about the non-linear propagation of shocks, the distributional impacts of policies, or how endogenous firm entry and exit can affect economic performance.[15] Policy actions undertaken in the last ten years in monetary policy and in regulation and supervision have made the world more resilient. But we should continue preparing for new challenges.  The changes that we have discussed, profound as they are, often hinge on one fundamental idea. A natural question to ask is whether such an idea sprang out as a response to a specific policy problem or was rather conceived previously in an entirely different, unrelated intellectual environment, perhaps addressing a different set of problems. It is a question that is especially relevant in economics, when previously held consensus views change. But it is a question that is unlikely to have a precise answer.  Let me rather use the 1939 words of Abraham Flexner, the first director of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study: “Almost every discovery has a long precarious history. Someone finds a bit here, another a bit there. A third step succeeds later, and thus onward till a genius pieces the bits together and makes the decisive contribution.”[16]  Today, I have had the privilege of addressing such people – geniuses who have pieced the bits together and made decisive contributions.

He once said “change is mandatory, survival is optional; choose wisely”[1].  Even though Tavenas was speaking about the impact of globalisation on universities, what he said also holds true for the euro area and its recent history.  When the financial crisis struck, it was clear that things could not go on as they had in the past. Change was mandatory. The banking union was the euro area’s response - the most significant step towards closer integration in Europe since the creation of the single currency. This means that the euro area now has common banking supervision and a single resolution mechanism with harmonised rules and procedures. A European deposit insurance scheme is still under discussion. Establishing the banking union has made the euro area financial system safer, but since it was proposed in 2012 its implementation has been challenging for banks, especially as it coincided with unprecedented monetary policy action and regulation.  Tonight, my fellow speakers will discuss the design and the achievements of the banking union in greater detail. I would like to focus on the other challenge banks are facing: an environment of low and negative interest rates.   Costs and benefits Over the past eight years, central banks worldwide have had to go to extremes to honour their mandates to safeguard price stability and shield their economies from the fallout of the financial crisis.  In the euro area, the ECB started providing banks with abundant liquidity, also through long-term refinancing operations. We launched an asset purchase programme of unprecedented size, cut interest rates to record-low levels and embarked on forward guidance to give markets a clearer signal about our future policy path. Among the major central banks, the ECB was the first to introduce negative interest rates on its deposit facility in June 2014. It now stands at -0.4%. No other central bank has gone as low without putting a multi-tier system in place. These very decisive policy measures have one objective: to fulfil our legal obligation, i.e. to ensure price stability defined as an inflation rate below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.  Our policy is working. Lending is gradually increasing as a result. In August, lending to companies grew by 1.9% year-on-year while household lending grew by 1.8%, both unchanged from July's reading. A broader measure of money circulating (M3) rose to 5.1% from an upwardly revised 4.9% in July.  Also, banks have considerably eased access to financing for the private sector. Between June 2014 and July 2016, the composite cost-of-borrowing indicator for new corporate loans fell by 152 basis points in Italy, 130 basis points in Spain, 40 basis points in Luxembourg, and 95 basis points in the euro area as a whole.  Although slow, economic recovery is under way. Unemployment is decreasing, economic growth is picking up, and inflation is expected to rise to 1.6% in 2018. When our next set of projections, which includes 2019, is published in December we might be broadly in line with our mandate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We are on the right track. We are aware, however, that in particular our non-standard policy measures come with side effects. Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks.  Low rates put pressure on banks’ profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks’ profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%.  Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the overall impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action[2]. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.  A negative outlook for banks weighs on banks’ share prices, thereby raising their cost of capital and ultimately decreasing the net return on lending. This may cause banks to become more conservative in their lending to euro area companies and households, which is key for the transmission of our monetary policy.  We already see that the low interest rate environment has sparked increasing competition from the non-banking sector. “Shadow banks” – an unfortunate label – or non-banks have increasingly moved into financial intermediation in the euro area since the financial crisis. Between the end of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2015, non-banks expanded their share of financial assets held by euro area financial corporations from 42% to 57%[3]. This may suggest an improvement in the transmission of our monetary policy as these institutions are to some extent more flexible than banks because they are less strictly regulated and supervised. But at the same time, we need to be mindful that non-banks are also likely to retrench more rapidly in times of crisis.  Moreover, technological innovation and the search for yield in a low-interest environment are likely to intensify competition for credit and deposit-like savings products. The risk is that this will lead to lower lending standards, higher leverage and insufficient shock-absorbing buffers.  Last but not least, a protracted phase of very low interest rates weighs heavily on the profitability and solvency of financial companies which promise minimum nominal returns over the longer term, e.g. life insurers and pension funds. If this phase lasts for too long, it could challenge the viability of return guarantee business models. There is evidence that the insurance and pension sectors have already been moving from guaranteed-return to unit-linked business models. This shows that the industry is adjusting. We need to monitor such risks, the side effects and the long-term impact of our monetary policy measures carefully. And we need to keep in mind that the longer our non-standard policy measures remain in place, the more pronounced their side effects will become. Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be.  Although the notion of a “zero lower bound” no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go – the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the “effective lower bound” or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%[4].  This level I would still deem to be “mildly negative” – but I would shy away from moving into “wildly negative” territory. Cutting interest rates even more would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be linear[5]. This needs to be taken into account when doing a cost-benefit analysis.   Conclusion Let me conclude. Over the course of the crisis, the ECB acted decisively and in line with its mandate. Change was mandatory and the path we chose is helping the euro area economy to return to growth and price stability. But interest rates can only stay very low over the short term. The longer they remain low, the more pronounced the negative side effects will become.  So far, we do not see any developments that could give rise to major concern. The positive impact on the economy outweighs any drawbacks there may be. But we need to be mindful, even as the upsides of our monetary policy prevail, because of the multi-pronged approach of our unconventional, and by definition temporary, monetary policy. Our unprecedented policy reaction to the crisis has clearly added to the list of challenges banks are facing today. But what we did was necessary to preserve price stability in the euro area, which is what we have been mandated to do. As such, we are fully aware of the crucial role banks play in transmitting monetary policy to the real economy. That is why we pay close attention to how banks are coping with all the challenges they face.  The banking union marks a significant change in the euro area financial system and it comes with a series of one-off adjustments for banks. Unlike the banking union though, our monetary policy measures lead to constant adjustments by the banking sector, especially the longer the current measures stay in place. It is therefore in everybody’s interest to ensure that we can leave this period of low interest rates behind sooner rather than later. But it’s not solely the responsibility of the ECB. It will also require courageous, far-sighted and sensible action by other policymakers to bring the euro area back to sustainable growth. May they choose wisely.

      "['2016-09-28', 'Mario Draghi', 'Working together for growth in Europe', 'Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at Deutscher Bundestag, Berlin, 28 September 2016', '  Working together for growth in Europe   Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at Deutscher Bundestag, Berlin, 28 September 2016  Introduction Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Bundestag, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your invitation. It is a pleasure to speak here in in the halls of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union, where you bring the debate about European integration to the Bundestag, the heart of German democracy.  As President of the ECB, I am here today to explain our policies and discuss with you how the ECB is acting to fulfil the mandate that was democratically conferred upon us by the Treaty. As members of the Bundestag, you know what the concerns of the German people are. I look forward to hearing about these concerns and addressing them today. When I came to the Bundestag four years ago, we were at the height of the crisis. Today, the euro area is in better shape. To protect price stability, the ECB used its instruments in a manner it had not done before and developed new tools – all within our mandate. We reduced our interest rates to very low levels, provided targeted financing to support banks’ lending to firms and households, and started a large-scale asset purchase programme. In my introductory remarks I want to make three points. First, I want to explain why we are pursuing our policies. I want to show how our monetary policy has maintained price stability and countered the threat of a new “Great Depression”. Our measures are working: they are contributing to keeping the recovery on track, thus creating jobs and ensuring a recovery that ultimately also benefits savers and pensioners in Germany and the euro area as a whole. But I do understand that people have concerns. We take these concerns seriously.  I will therefore discuss in more detail – and this is my second point – how our measures affect people’s finances and welfare. As with any monetary policy decision, our measures have distributional effects on citizens. But, on balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioners and taxpayers across the euro area, including in Germany, are better off because of our actions – today and tomorrow. Finally, I will talk about what else is needed. The ECB does not operate in a vacuum: other economic policies are essential to complement our monetary policy. Without them there will be no strong and sustainable recovery. These other policies are a precondition for interest rates to rise again.  The ECB’s actions have safeguarded price stability Let me start with the reasons for our actions. The ECB acted because inflation drifted away from our aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.  The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This objective binds me and my colleagues in the ECB Governing Council, where our decisions are the result of collegial debate. We are held accountable for these decisions in the European Parliament, where I attend four regular hearings per year. Furthermore, our decisions are subject to judicial review. This is what I mean when I say: with our measures, we follow the law.  Sometimes people wonder whether price stability doesn’t mean inflation of 0%. It does not, because both inflation that is too high and inflation that is too low for too long can damage the economy. A steady, measured rate of inflation below, but close to, 2% in the medium term acts like a cushion that protects our economies from drifting into the dangerous territory of negative inflation even when there is just a minor economic shock.[1] Once expectations of falling prices become ingrained, consumers postpone purchases in anticipation of even lower prices, while firms hold off making investments because they do not know whether they will pay off. This downward spiral continues until the economy collapses. There are therefore very good reasons why central banks are so careful to avoid inflation that is either too high or too low. You would rightly expect us to act if inflation is significantly above our objective of price stability. We also need to act when inflation is close to 0%. How do we achieve our price stability objective? When inflation is too high, central banks raise interest rates to break the upward trend; when inflation is too low, they lower interest rates to achieve the opposite. Lower interest rates ease overall financing conditions in the economy. This in turn stimulates investment and consumption, which then induces inflation to pick up. But when lowering interest rates alone may not be sufficient to return to inflation rates that are in line with price stability, central banks may need to use other instruments to ease monetary and financial conditions. This is why we launched other measures, such as our asset purchase programmes. And we are by no means unique in this. Around the globe, central banks of the major advanced economies like the US, the UK and Japan have all embarked on large-scale sovereign bond purchase programmes to fulfil their mandate.  Our measures have delivered. We estimate that they will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, over 2016 and 2017. They will also contribute to increasing real euro area GDP growth by more than one and a half percentage points cumulatively between 2015 and 2018, which will support job creation.   The effects of our policies Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation. They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis. And the ECB’s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact. But very low rates are not innocuous. They affect people’s finances and welfare. Let me start with the effects of our policies on savers. Yes, the current low interest rate environment reduces the nominal return on saving accounts. But what counts for savers is not the nominal interest rate but the real interest rate, which is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. Real rates are also low, but there have been many episodes of low, or even negative real interest rates in Germany well before the introduction of the euro, as a recent Bundesbank study has shown.[2]  Moreover, savers can on average still earn satisfactory rates of return from diversifying their assets, even when interest rates on deposit and savings accounts are very low. This has also been the case in Germany according to another recent Bundesbank study. [3] But most importantly, whatever financial assets savers hold, they will benefit from a recovery of the economy. So the interest of all of us, including German savers, is the highest possible sustainable growth in Germany and the euro area.  Through our efforts to bring inflation back towards 2%, we have contributed to higher growth and the creation of more jobs. In Germany, exports are benefitting from the recovery in the euro area, unemployment is at its lowest level since reunification, people’s take-home pay is increasing noticeably, and venture capital is pouring into Berlin’s silicon alley.  We should also not forget that people in your constituencies are affected in different ways by our measures. They are affected as savers, borrowers or taxpayers, and in many cases as all three. What a household may lose in terms of little interest on their bank account, it might save in lower mortgage payments for their home. And it might benefit from rising bond and stock prices in their retirement fund. In fact, evidence shows that between 2008 and 2015 interest payments by households in Germany, as a percentage of gross disposable income, fell more sharply than interest earnings.[4]  And the low financing costs for government bonds help to balance the budget and reduce debt at a considerable speed. This is good news for the Finance Ministry - and thus for taxpayers - which saved in 2015 alone approximately EUR 28 billion on lower than expected interest payments. We should also consider the full effect of low interest rates on banks. Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal. But what has been forgotten is that many banks have been able to more than offset declining interest revenues with higher lending volumes, improved loan performance and lower interest expenses, all of which are beneficial to both the banks and their customers.[5] The ECB’s monetary policy is not the main factor for the low profitability of banks. While some banks’ business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions. Let us be clear, however, there is no one size fits all banking model and we have different types of banks that are successfully operating in Germany and in the euro area.  Of course, low interest rates for a long period might carry the risk of overvaluation in asset markets as a result of the search for yield. This is why we closely monitor potential risks to financial stability that might emanate for instance from local real estate markets. But at the moment we are not seeing any overheating in the euro area or the German economy as a whole. While we do observe a somewhat stronger increase in residential real estate prices, notably in large cities in Germany, such increases are not the reflection of a bubble, as lending is growing only moderately. Moreover, overall household debt-to-income levels are comparatively low and stable.\\xa0Where signs of excessive risk-taking emerge, macroprudential measures at the national level should be the instrument of choice. They allow exuberant financial developments to be addressed in a more targeted way, while monetary policy contributes to the stability of the euro area as a whole. So far I have discussed the reasons for our measures and their effects. To summarise, our policies allow the recovery to take hold so that we will be able to raise interest rates again. After all, the interest earnings that the savers understandably crave need to be generated first in the real economy. In a stagnant economy there is little to be shared out. It should also be noted that the level to which real interest rates can eventually return when the economy strengthens is not determined by monetary policy. Instead, it depends on the economy’s long-term growth prospects. Productivity and demographics play a decisive role in this, and the development of these factors has not been favourable in Europe in recent years. This is a phenomenon we also see in Germany. For long-term interest rates to rise in the future we therefore need more investment and structural reforms to lift growth and productivity. As Wolfgang Schäuble said in this house a couple of weeks ago when he presented the budget for 2017: we will only get out of this phase of low interest rates if we have more sustainable growth in Europe.   The need for decisive action at the national and European level This leads me to my final point: policy-makers across the euro area, need to seize the opportunity to deliver reforms. At the height of the crisis, all Member States and citizens showed an enormous commitment to keeping the euro area together when the critics were already talking about the euro’s demise. But we cannot stop here: we need to make sure not only that the euro survives, but that our Economic and Monetary Union thrives.  If we want to succeed, we will need to find common solutions for the problems that we all face. If we want to preserve the European social model, we will need to bring labour and product markets in line with the realities of the digital and globalised world of the 21st century. If we want savers to benefit from higher interest rates in the future, we will need to create investment opportunities to put these savings to a productive use. This is about raising productivity and employment.[6] This is about structural reforms that are a necessary complement to our monetary policy. And Member States have to do their part. I have highlighted this many times in the past.[7] In fact, I emphasise it every six weeks at the ECB’s press conference.  And where we face common supranational challenges, and currently there are several such challenges, there is no alternative to acting jointly as Europeans. Consider the transformative power of the deepening of the Single Market at the end of the 1980s. This opened up new opportunities and it continues to benefit European companies and individuals alike. Consider what can still be achieved with the Digital Single Market, the energy union and the capital markets union. Without a well-functioning Single Market, our firms would lose access to a market of 500 million consumers. Without a Single Market, we Europeans would have little global leverage to uphold our values, such as our respect for the right to privacy on the internet. Together we are immeasurably stronger.[8]   Conclusion Let me conclude. The ECB is vigorously counteracting risks to price stability using all necessary tools within its mandate. Our monetary policy has supported growth and employment and will eventually bring inflation back to our aim of below, but close to, 2%. Low interest rates today are necessary for a return to higher interest rates in the future. What we need now is to allow our measures to develop their full impact. And in order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions.

      "['2016-09-28', 'Mario Draghi', 'Researching the Macroeconomic Policies of the Future', 'Welcome address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the first ECB Annual Research Conference,Frankfurt am Main, 28 September 2016', '  Researching the Macroeconomic Policies of the Future   Welcome address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the first ECB Annual Research Conference,Frankfurt am Main, 28 September 2016 Let me welcome you all to the European Central Bank’s first Annual Research Conference (ARC). This is of course not the first gathering to discuss research that the ECB has held in its 18-year history. But the ARC is deliberately greater in scale than the many smaller workshops we have held in the past, covering the whole range of research relevant for central banks. Our aim is to bring together academia and central banks working at the cutting edge of economics. The ARC will be our flagship research event each year, making today’s conference the first of many to come. The ECB commits significant resources to research because good research is the foundation of good policy. It strengthens the theoretical underpinnings of our policy framework, lays the groundwork for the models we use in our conjunctural analysis, and helps battle the terrible twins of empirical macroeconomics: endogeneity and identification. The ability of research to identify counterfactuals allows us to analyse the ex post effects of our measures, and to understand the ex ante impact of new policies prior to their launch. As the crisis in the euro area has progressed through its various phases, our need for such research has evidently increased sharply. To meet our inflation objective we have had to deploy a wide array of new measures, some of which had no precedent in recent monetary history, or at least no track record in the euro area. In doing so, we have drawn heavily on the body of academic research into unconventional monetary policies that has built up during the crisis. But at times we have also had to act faster than academia has been able to follow. We have depended crucially on internal research by ECB staff to design, assess and recalibrate monetary policy. The fragmentation of the euro area financial system in 2011-12, for example, required us to fundamentally deepen our understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism. A declining real equilibrium rate has caused us to adopt a negative interest rate policy to provide the right degree of monetary stimulus, which in turn requires a closer study of the effects of breaking through the zero bound. We have had to learn how an asset purchase programme works in the special conditions of the euro area, characterised by segmented asset markets and bank-based transmission.  We had little choice but to conduct both policy and research in real time. In many cases we were operating in largely unchartered waters. But the important point is that, in each case, we were able to design effective monetary policies to cope with an unprecedented series of shocks. And we did so based on the best insights that research could provide at the time. But if our internal analysis has inevitably moved ahead of academia during the crisis, we are now eager for academia to catch up. We depend on both internal and external research to help us evaluate what we have done, to scrutinise the various measures we have taken, to offer insights and analyses that equip us for the future. Good policymaking can only benefit from such scrutiny, and we welcome it. And looking forward, we depend on research to help us in other ways, too. Perhaps most salient today is the theme of the interactions between monetary policy and other policies – what I have elsewhere called “independence in interdependence”.[1] To my mind it is increasingly evident that, when we operate near the lower bound, such interactions are heightened. Properly aligned policies can help buttress each other, while misaligned policies can produce greater side effects. To ensure that monetary policy can be implemented with maximum effectiveness and minimum side effects we need to understand those interactions better.  For instance, we know that if interest rates are to rise safely away from the lower bound, we need structural reforms to raise potential output in the euro area and boost long-run interest rates. But the term structural reform remains somewhat vague. What are the key reforms needed to lift total factor productivity growth, by ensuring optimal rates of innovation and re-allocation of resources to where they are most productive? How do they differ among countries and at different stages of the cycle? Structural reforms are politically difficult, so they need to be based on rigorous research and optimally sequenced to yield quick and tangible results to bolster momentum for continued reform. Along the same vein, we need more robust policy prescriptions on the optimal composition of fiscal policy to promote growth. We also need to understand better how monetary policy works in the new post-crisis financial landscape. Since the crisis, much research has focused on the role of financial intermediation in macroeconomic dynamics. But given the ECB’s newly acquired powers, more research is needed on the interactions between macroprudential regulation, microprudential supervision and monetary policy to help guide policymakers on their optimal mix. Research can also underpin the policies required to complete capital markets and banking union which are key to safeguarding monetary transmission in the face of shocks. Finally, we need to understand the optimal balance of policy tools in terms of efficiency and equity. We know that failure by central banks to act during the crisis would have had distributional consequences not only on asset and debt holders, but also on the most vulnerable in our society who are disproportionately affected by unemployment. But little is known to date of the distributional consequences of the unconventional tools we have used, either in respect of their impact or over the medium term. Of the range of tools that are effective at delivering our inflation objective, which have the least redistributive effects? And how should we combine those tools and other policies to yield the same benefits while mitigating the costs? The complex interlinkages between monetary policy and other policies in the aftermath of the crisis have challenged central bankers and academics alike. Setting policy effectively in the new global environment requires a solid foundation of high-quality research. Conferences such as this first ARC provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen the links between policymakers and academics and help create that solid foundation. I look forward to the new insights that these next two days will bring. And, having identified the key areas of further research required for strong and stable growth in the euro area that is shared by all, I look forward to hearing your ideas and analysis at next year’s second ARC.

      "['2016-09-27', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'Reforming financial sector benchmarks', 'Welcome remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the annual meeting of the Money Market Contact Group, Frankfurt am Main, Tuesday 27 September 2016', '  Reforming financial sector benchmarks   Welcome remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the annual meeting of the Money Market Contact Group, Frankfurt am Main, Tuesday 27 September 2016 Ladies and gentlemen,  I am pleased to be with you and very much appreciate having an opportunity to discuss with you issues of importance to the money market.  There is a topic that in the last few years has drawn the attention of regulators, of legislators, of market participants but also of the general public, namely financial benchmarks.  I hardly need to convince any of you of the relevance of benchmarks such as EURIBOR, LIBOR or EONIA. Indeed, I only need to quote the European Commission, which recently declared EURIBOR to be a “critical” benchmark in the light of the vast number of contracts which use it as a reference – more than €180 trillion of derivatives contracts and more than €1 trillion of retail mortgages. Indeed, benchmarks have over the years become an essential part of the infrastructure of our economy. They are indices that are used to determine the level of payment in a financial contract, whereby neither party to the contract has any control over their setting. Their value and their credibility are derived from the fact that they are considered impartial, representative, and therefore fair. If the impartiality of a benchmark is compromised, confidence in any contractual relationship based on that benchmark will be, as a result, seriously undermined. Therefore, following the scandals involving some of the biggest benchmarks, regulators and legislators, in coordination with private sector, identified market shortcomings and designed a framework that would guarantee the integrity of reference rates.  And a lot has been achieved so far:   The private sector has played an important role in improving the benchmark-setting process by designing new codes of conduct, by enhancing transparency and visibility, by launching private initiatives reflecting market needs, and by identifying alternative benchmarks.  The public sector has contributed to this process as well. Since 2013 the FSB and the International Organization of Securities Commissions have worked to reform benchmarks, supporting and steering the efforts of private market participants to define more robust and reliable benchmarks and related “best practices”. In addition, the public sector has adopted a dedicated regulation.  As benchmarks are an important part of the global financial system and an essential tool in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, they matter to the ECB as well. We have been committed to improving the relevant benchmarks for the euro, as have other central banks in respect of their currencies.  While the ECB has always stressed that financial benchmarks should be private initiatives tailored to private needs, we have also helped the private sector by shaping some of the benchmark reform initiatives. For example, we have been following closely the reform of EURIBOR from a quote-based to a transaction-based index. Moreover, together with the EURIBOR administrator, we launched a data collection back in 2013 to analyse the feasibility of transaction-based alternatives. And indeed it was this group, the Money Market Contact Group that was asked to participate to at least 100%. And you delivered. The EURIBOR reform has now reached an important stage. The transition to the transaction-based methodology is foreseen for 2017 and the administrator is planning a pre-live verification exercise to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed methodology under current market conditions. For the pre-live verification – and eventually for the EURIBOR reform – to be a success, broad market representation has to be achieved. Therefore, not only should current panel members participate but also other banks in the euro money market. A lack of participants might seriously threaten the completion of the pre-live verification and ultimately the reference rate itself. Therefore, in view of the tremendous importance of benchmarks such as EURIBOR, the ECB would like to see banks take responsibility for the benchmark in two ways. Firstly, by participating in the pre-live verification and secondly, by eventually joining the panel of contributors to EURIBOR with the launch of the new calculation methodology. Banks are among the biggest users of EURIBOR. As such, they would also incur the biggest costs and losses if it came to an abrupt end. It is therefore up to the banking industry as a whole to support this benchmark. But the burden cannot only be shouldered by the current panel banks, which have indeed shown their sense of responsibility. Despite the related costs and perceived risks, they have remained in the panel and helped to prevent any disorderly dismantling of EURIBOR.  But there are other examples. In some cases, banks that are among the largest institutions in their jurisdiction, and therefore rely hugely on the benchmark to price their products, have chosen to leave the panel. This is a worrisome development. Some members left because of the perceived elevated risks related to the usage of expert judgement while contributing to EURIBOR. Since their departure, however, there have been a couple of important changes. Firstly, a new regulation has been adopted in Europe, establishing rules guiding the process of setting a benchmark and therefore contributing to greater regulatory certainty. Secondly, the envisaged reform of EURIBOR, aimed at anchoring the benchmark in transactions, will eventually remove the expert judgement and therefore the subjective element in contributing to EURIBOR.  Some banks also saw as an impediment for their participation in the envisaged transaction- based index the costs they will incur for transaction reporting. But the incremental costs for joining the EURIBOR pre-live verification and for contributing to a benchmark with transaction data may actually be limited for those banks, which already report under the ECB Money Market Statistical Reporting Regulation. This is because these banks have already set up systems in order to extract and report transaction data. In conclusion, I hope that banks will indeed take the opportunity to create better, more robust and representative benchmarks, which will better suit the needs of end users.  And I also hope that banks will continue to participate in the panel – or decide to join or re-join it – so as to ensure that EURIBOR as well as the other reference rates continue to play their critical role in the European economy.

      "['2016-09-26', 'Mario Draghi', 'Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament', 'Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 26 September 2016', '  Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament   Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Brussels, 26 September 2016 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to be back speaking to your committee less than a week away from an important anniversary for the European Parliament: 40 years ago the act that made direct European elections possible was signed, and I am happy to be speaking to you – the direct representatives of the people of Europe.  Europeans are calling on our institutions to bring tangible benefits to their everyday lives. We need to respond to this appeal with action within our respective competences. This is why I am here today: not only to demonstrate once again the importance that the ECB places on being accountable to EU citizens, but also to discuss with you how the ECB is acting to fulfil the mandate that was democratically conferred upon us. Therefore, in my remarks today I will first review the state of the euro area recovery and the impact of our monetary policy measures. Then, at the request of this committee, I will discuss financial market conditions in the euro area and, in particular, the evolution of financial market integration.  The economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue at a moderate and steady pace, but with slightly less momentum than envisaged in June.  On the positive side, incoming information continues to point to the euro area economy being resilient to global and political uncertainty, notably following the UK referendum outcome. The initial impact of the vote has been contained and the strong financial market reactions, such as equity price falls, have largely reversed.  At the same time, the substantial weakening of the foreign demand outlook since June is expected to dampen export growth. Along with other factors, it will continue to pose downside risks to the euro area’s growth prospects. According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, annual real GDP growth is expected to increase by 1.7% this year, and by 1.6% in each of the next two years. Inflation continues to remain at low levels, reflecting past declines in oil prices and weak wage growth. Annual inflation is expected to be 0.2% this year and to increase to 1.2% in 2017 as the impact of past oil price falls unwinds. The continued economic recovery and a decline in the level of slack are expected to gradually push inflation further up to 1.6% in 2018.  Against this background, our comprehensive policy measures continue to filter through to the real economy. Borrowing conditions for households and firms have eased considerably and credit creation has strengthened, thus supporting aggregate spending across the euro area.  Let me now focus on the description of the credit easing components of our policy measures. They act as critical transmission channels for the monetary stimulus by facilitating meaningful reductions in funding costs for the real economy.  In June of this year and last week we conducted the first two operations of our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-II), which attracted significant demand. Two additional operations will take place in December and March. These operations allow banks to secure long-term funding at very attractive conditions that they can pass on to their customers.  Likewise, the credit easing components of our expanded asset purchase programme (APP), namely the asset-backed securities (ABSPP), covered bond (CBPP3) and corporate sector (CSPP) purchase programmes, further boost the pass-through of our monetary policy by directly lowering the financing costs for crucial actors in our economy. While the ABSPP and CBPP3 empower the monetary pass-through by containing banks’ funding costs, the CSPP directly lowers the cost and improves the availability of market-based funding for non-financial corporations.  Let me stress, in that respect, that the CSPP is benefiting not only the large companies, which can directly access the bond market, but also smaller companies. Buoyant bond market conditions for large companies incentivise them to obtain more funding from bond markets, thus leaving more space on banks’ balance sheets for providing loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Overall, our projections indicate that the accommodative monetary policy stance will continue to provide effective support to the cyclical recovery and the upward path in inflation.  But financing conditions must remain supportive for our baseline scenario to materialise. Therefore, the Governing Council will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely. We will preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is embedded in our staff projections and that is necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. If warranted, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate.  Financial market conditions in the euro area I am grateful that today you decided to discuss the state of financial market fragmentation in the euro area. I remember that almost four years ago, in this same building, in my statement to you I commented that “the impact on financial and monetary conditions of past reductions in key ECB interest rates differed considerably within the euro area”. Compared with the financial market situation in the autumn of 2012, the situation has largely improved. Financial market fragmentation has declined substantially and the financing conditions of firms and households have improved markedly across the euro area.  In particular, the reductions in the key ECB interest rates have been passed through in vulnerable euro area countries to a larger extent, and the fragmentation in funding costs and loan conditions across different countries has receded. To give an example, from October 2012 to July 2016 the composite cost-of-borrowing indicator for new loans to non-financial corporations declined by almost 287 basis points in Portugal and 200 basis points in Italy, compared with 117 basis points for the euro area as a whole.  A similar phenomenon has been observed for SMEs, which have benefited substantially from improved financing conditions and reduced fragmentation. As a result, the spread between lending rates for small loans and large loans was similar in July 2016 in vulnerable and non-vulnerable euro area countries (at 135 and about 120 basis points, respectively), a situation not seen since spring 2011.  Addressing new challenges While the challenges of financial fragmentation have been largely overcome, there are new ones we have to face. The low interest rate environment you selected for today’s discussion is indeed one of them.  Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation. They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis.  The ECB’s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact.  Nevertheless, monetary policy cannot determine the sustainable level of real interest rates in the long run, as they in turn depend on long-term growth prospects.  This means that other policy actors need to do their part, pursuing fiscal and structural policies which will contribute to a self-sustaining recovery and increase the economic growth potential of the euro area, as I discussed with you in June.  In the meantime, the low interest rate environment has a range of implications for economic actors that need to be carefully monitored. I am sure that this was part of your exchange today with the Chairs of the European Supervisory Authorities, and I am of course happy to continue this discussion in answering your questions.  Another, more recent, challenge is the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership and its economic implications for the euro area. The extent to which the economic outlook will be affected depends on the timing, development and final outcome of the upcoming negotiations. So far, the euro area economy has been resilient, but due to this uncertainty our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. But more generally, it is important to ensure that the European Union meets the expectations of its people. This requires three lines of action.  First, new common European projects should focus on the immediate concerns and needs of its people. For those challenges that unequivocally go beyond national borders, effective solutions require joint European action. From that perspective, today’s priorities notably include the fields of migration, security and defence.  Second, for further European integration to be feasible and acceptable, trust among its nations and people is essential. To bolster such trust, it is important that agreed rules are respected. In our Economic and Monetary Union, in particular, the economic governance framework is essential to avoid imbalances that would eventually risk destabilising the euro area. And for the euro area to thrive, actions by national governments are needed to unleash growth, reduce unemployment and empower individuals, while offering essential protections for the most vulnerable.  Finally, our Economic and Monetary Union remains vulnerable as long as we do not complete the integration projects we have started. We need, in particular, to complete the banking union and develop an ambitious capital markets union (CMU) to ensure the resilience of financial integration in the euro area and support cross-border investment. The European Parliament played a key part in setting up the banking union and has an important role to play to ensure swift progress on the legislative dossiers which are now under discussion as part of the banking union and CMU agendas.  Making determined progress in these fields would significantly strengthen our Economic and Monetary Union, and thus constitute an important step forward in line with the roadmap proposed in the Five Presidents’ Report.  Conclusion In concluding these remarks, I want to recall the words of my late friend and colleague Carlo Azeglio Ciampi when he addressed the European Parliament in 2005:  “The euro is the greatest demonstration of the united will of the European people, and a driving force of political integration”.  And, indeed, the political commitment underpinning our single currency has been strongly reaffirmed during the crisis. Important efforts have been made.  But widespread feelings of insecurity, including economic insecurity, remain a major concern. We cannot simply wait for better times: we need to renew our efforts to ensure that Economic and Monetary Union offers protection and prosperity. The ECB will do its part. Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.     SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs    ']\n",
      "['2016-09-26', 'Benoît Cœuré', 'Having confidence in Europe', 'Keynote speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at a conference organised by the Istituto Affari Internazionali,Rome, 26 September 2016', \"  Having confidence in Europe   Keynote speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at a conference organised by the Istituto Affari Internazionali,Rome, 26 September 2016 The European Union is going through a difficult phase.[1] The economic crisis, the threat of terrorism and the arrival of an unprecedented number of migrants are posing challenges to Europeans. The EU’s responses to these challenges have not removed doubts about its ability to act coherently and effectively when common solutions are needed. Following the UK’s referendum on EU membership, Europe has become embroiled in a wide-ranging discussion about its raison d’être. This discussion will however not be successful if it is merely a diplomatic exercise: if Europe is about bringing Europeans closer together, it needs to relate to its citizens and listen to civil society. In other words, the res publica needs to be discussed in the various parts of the forum, not just the Curia, where senators met here in Rome, but also the Comitium, where citizens could openly debate the matters of the time. I am thus grateful for your invitation and the opportunity to speak here at the Istituto Affari Internazionali today and to engage in a discussion with you.  What I will present are observations and assessments from the perspective of a European central banker who can analyse and provide suggestions. But, as you will see, quite a number of the issues that I will discuss today lie outside the realm of central banking and can in fact only come about through political debate and ultimately political leadership.  In my view, the European Union today lacks confidence in two important ways:  First, there is a lack of confidence in Europe; that is, in the ability of European policies to address today’s challenges, reap the benefits of globalisation while controlling its costs, and increase Europe’s economic potential. This lack of confidence is reflected in the low levels of public trust in EU institutions, in the rising support for Eurosceptic parties, and was evident in the outcome of the UK referendum in June this year.  Second, there is also a lack of confidence between Europeans. This is compounded by a perceived lack of a strong unifying bond or joint identity as EU citizens. The divergence between national public discourses on economic governance has reached disturbingly high levels in the euro area. Sometimes, there is not even a common analysis on what has gone wrong. Policymakers are increasingly speaking about each other and not with each other. Let’s therefore set aside the preconceptions and ask ourselves how we can restore confidence in Europe and between Europeans.  First, I will argue, there is need for resolute actions at national level. Second, there is need to provide clarity and ensure consistency in European integration. And, third, to overcome political fragmentation, there is need to reinforce common fora for debating the future of Europe.   There are good reasons to have confidence in Europe First, I believe that there are in fact good reasons to have confidence in Europe and I want to mention some of them[2].  Alongside the United States and China, the European Union is currently one of the three biggest economic blocs in the world, each of roughly equal size in terms of purchasing power parity. Europe protects its citizens from external economic disruption and offers them a unique social model. A social model that we can be proud of and that can inspire the world, provided we can make it sustainable.  Furthermore, we have managed to largely mitigate the recent financial and economic crisis, which for many countries in the EU was the most serious crisis since the Second World War. It was only four years ago that the euro area looked into the abyss. But today, we find ourselves in a significantly better environment. In summer 2012, financial fragmentation was at its peak but has since then strongly receded. Five Member States were in economic adjustment programmes, four of them are now again standing on their own feet. Unemployment, although still unacceptably high in some countries, declined in 2016 for the third consecutive year, and employment growth in the euro area has beaten our expectations. The euro, despite the deficiencies in its architecture, has tangible benefits for the people of Europe. It is the second most important currency in the world, and it has delivered measurable economic benefits for Europeans since its introduction[3]. Investment and competition have likewise benefited from the reduction of currency risks and transaction costs. The euro protected the Single Market by eliminating the possibility of competitive exchange rate devaluations. And without the euro, it is unlikely that our small or medium-sized economies would have better weathered the global financial turmoil.  During the crisis, the euro was arguably the greatest bond holding Europeans together: the commitment to protect the single currency and the integrity of the euro area determined key decisions taken by European institutions and Member States. Its force as a common bond is also reflected in public opinion: popular support for the euro has remained high throughout the crisis. In spring 2016, support for the single currency stood at 68% in the euro area[4] with a majority of citizens in favour of the euro in all euro area Member States.  The ECB as the institution tasked with safeguarding the price stability of the euro has proven that it is able to act decisively within its mandate, even in very difficult situations, and to adapt its policy tools to a changing economic environment. We estimate that all other things being equal the measures we have taken since 2014 will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, in 2016 and 2017. And they will help to increase real euro area GDP growth more than one and a half percentage points cumulated over 2015-2018.  Finally, the establishment of European banking supervision has brought some important improvements to the financial architecture of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). For almost two years the ECB has now been supervising around 130 of the most significant banks of the euro area and indirectly supervising all other banks. And banks have substantially strengthened their capital positions in that time: since 2012, the CET1 ratio for significant banks, for instance, has moved up from 9% to more than 13% today. Moreover, ECB Banking Supervision is operating at arm’s length from banks and enforcing a level playing field in the euro area by harmonising supervisory practices.  In summary, the EU’s economic potential, the euro as our single currency backed by a single, credible and effective institution and the establishment of the single supervisor are all very good reasons to have confidence in Europe.  Nevertheless, I won’t deny that we need to do much better in a number of areas.  As mentioned previously, monetary policy has been very effective in supporting output and inflation. But as I have said elsewhere[5], our monetary policy measures were taken on the implicit assumption that they would be transient: on the one hand, because monetary stimulus would ultimately help counter the cyclical forces depressing the real equilibrium rate and on the other hand because other economic and fiscal policies would provide cyclical support and tackle the more structural drivers of low real rates.  But if fiscal and economic policies do not in fact play this role, we risk being trapped in a low growth, low interest rate equilibrium. Moving from interest rates being “low for long” to being “low forever” would severely limit the room for manoeuvre for conventional monetary policy tools, but even more worryingly, it would threaten the contract between generations as well as risk tearing up our social fabric. Today, building confidence in Europe also means showing that together with national governments, it can steer us away from that outcome. There are two ways in which we need to improve economic and fiscal policies. On the one hand national governments need to live up to their responsibilities for these policy areas. On the other hand, we need to strengthen economic and fiscal policy tools at European level. Let me explain this in more detail.  National governments need to live up to their responsibilities  The solution to this situation must start at national level. One important cornerstone of the current set-up is the principle that responsibility for economic and fiscal policies lies largely with national governments. There are coordination tools at European level, but ultimately, decisions are made by the elected representatives at national level. Therefore, national governments need to live up to this responsibility: economic and fiscal policies need to be used more decisively so as to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area [6].  Italy has taken key steps in these areas. A comprehensive reform of the labour market was carried out last year. The new rules on open-ended contracts and the subsidy for new hires seem to be having an initial positive impact on the creation of permanent jobs.[7] Important measures have also been taken to address the challenges of the banking sector and to reduce the administrative burden on firms and households. However, more structural reforms are necessary in Italy as in all euro area countries. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of adequate public infrastructure, all of which are vital in increasing investment and boosting job creation. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery in a sustainable way. There is room everywhere to focus public expenditure more on items which will raise productivity. Those countries that have fiscal room for manoeuvre should use it wisely; but others that don’t have such room should not bend the commonly agreed rules– that is in their own interest as well as in the interest of Europe. Stretching rules to the point where they lose credibility will not pave the way for a stronger and safer Economic and Monetary Union.   Clarity and consistency in integration  This leads me my second point: we need to strengthen economic and fiscal policy tools at European level by pursuing clarity and consistency in European integration.   Clarity in integration is about making it easy to understand who is responsible for what. In the current set-up, loose coordination of economic policies at European level and ad hoc intergovernmental arrangements may give the impression that a competence has been passed to the European level, when in fact it continues to be exercised largely by Member States. This opens the door to shifting the blame for unpopular measures to the EU when in fact it does not effectively have the power to adopt policies. In addition, a clearer demarcation of competences between the European and national levels would allow the EU to prove to national audiences that Europe is part of the solution and not part of the problem.   Clarity is also about pointing out which institution takes which decisions at European level. This is why I support the establishment of a euro area finance ministry, accountable to the European Parliament. [8] This body could be responsible for preventing economic and fiscal imbalances, managing crises in the euro area, as well as representing euro area governments in international economic and financial institutions.  Consistency in integration means assigning the competences for strongly complementary policy areas to the same level of government. We cannot partially disempower national states without creating – at Union level – the capacity to provide at least as much security to citizens as before.  Let me illustrate. The Single Market is a point in case: it requires not only the opening of borders but also joint rules to ensure financial stability and a level playing field with fair competition. And joint rule-setting requires enforcement and judicial review, that is, supranational sovereignty sharing and political procedures that lead to common decisions.  And there are some good recent examples where the EU has exercised its power in this area for the benefit of European citizens. Take the recent state aid decisions by the Commission on some national tax schemes or the progressive abolition of roaming charges across the EU.   Consistency in integration is equally important – if not more so – for the half-finished construction of EMU. I understand very well, as a European citizen, why political attention is today focused on security and addressing the challenges of migration. But Europe will not build the resources needed to protect itself and manage migration flows without a strong and sustainable economy. Making our Economic and Monetary Union strong and sustainable requires a complete banking union and elements of a fiscal and economic union. None of us want to live in a half-built house because it will get very uncomfortable as soon as the next storm hits. We need to work on completing EMU also after Brexit.[9]  Today, there are clear disagreements on the balance between private and public risk-sharing, on the mix of national and EMU-wide responsibilities, and on the speed towards possible new arrangements. This discussion will take time. In my view, it should be embedded more broadly in a new convergence process, as suggested in the Five Presidents’ Report. Significant progress towards common convergence criteria would be regularly monitored and would be a condition for members to benefit from further risk-sharing instruments. This way the convergence process would set a clear incentive structure for Member States to overcome the current deadlock and would establish full transparency about the design of EMU.  However, for new projects and further integration steps there must be a consensus that joint action is truly necessary and linked to people’s needs. And we know from surveys[10] that there are areas where citizens would like the EU to become more active than at present. On that note, I want return very briefly to an aspect that is really for another speech or maybe even another speaker – someone not from the central banking world – to address. It is the lack of confidence between Europeans.   Common fora for debate  As I have said before, we need to be honest with ourselves: the Single Market and Economic and Monetary Union are not technocratic mechanisms but inherently political undertakings. And as political undertakings they require support and acceptance beyond the legitimacy gained via elected national governments or even through the provision of effective and efficient solutions. As laid down in the Treaty, supranational law and supranational institutions assume that we are not only nationals of our respective countries but also citizens of Europe. Being European citizens is in turn linked to a feeling of common identity.  The late President Ciampi embraced this principle emphatically:   Our common historical legacy, the awareness of possessing a European identity, our membership of a single value system, the principle of shared sovereignty mark out European citizenship and identify the European Union; they underpin its institutional, political and economic scaffolding.[11]  A common identity allows us to accept that the political undertakings we pursue together can temporarily produce losers and winners. It enables the minority to accept the decisions taken by the majority. When such an acceptance is not there but only national interests and national perspectives prevail, then confidence between Europeans is seriously undermined. One way of strengthening these conceptual underpinnings of Europe in my view would be to create more space for common debates on European issues.  Let me be clear: having common debates should not be understood as having the same view at all times. It is absolutely normal to disagree and it is entirely natural considering that the people of Europe have different histories, have grown up in different circumstances and express a wide variety of preferences. However, the problem starts when we are having 28 or 19 different discussions without channelling them into a common debate. Too often, domestic media and political actors take a national perspective in these debates. Too often the debtor-creditor dichotomy overshadows the debate of how we want to organise the economic governance of the euro area in the future. The result is a fragmentation of the democratic debate on Europe. This fragmentation is heightened by intergovernmental decision-making that involves endless negotiations and highlights the differences between the positions of various Member States. And such a fragmentation of our discourse sets a trap: the more divided we become over common solutions, the less effort we put into implementing them. As a result, Europe cannot deliver effectively and European policies, once again, appear ineffective. This only adds to people’s impatience and dissatisfaction with Europe, making it even more difficult to find effective European solutions.  To overcome this fragmentation we need to reinforce our common fora for debate. The European Parliament is an important element, but we should foster dialogues between Europeans also outside of existing institutional structures.[12] The result should be a positive “politicisation” of the EU[13], on which I understand analytical work is also being carried out here at the institute.  Conclusions  Confidence in Europe and among Europeans is low. And there are clearly areas where we need to do much better. National governments need to live up to their responsibilities for fiscal and economic policies, and we need a clear and consistent path of integration to avoid half-built houses and allow Europe to deliver. A new convergence process can offer such a path to break the deadlock. And achieving this goal will be much easier if we strengthen our common fora for debate and decision-making. This requires political leadership. But it also will help to meet citizens’ demands for a more effective Europe. We should have confidence in Europe. As Winston Churchill once said, “For myself, I am an optimist — it does not seem to be much use being anything else”. I now look forward to your questions and our discussion.

      "['2016-09-26', 'Yves Mersch', \"The next steps in the evolution of the Eurosystem's market infrastructure\", 'Opening remarks by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,<br>at the Eurosystem community session at Sibos,<br>Geneva, 26 September 2016', '  The next steps in the evolution of the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure   Opening remarks by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Eurosystem community session at Sibos,Geneva, 26 September 2016  Introduction One year ago, the Eurosystem shared some initial reflections on the strategy for the future development of its market infrastructure. The rationale behind these strategic reflections was the need to keep pace with technological developments in line with the mandate of our Treaty to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.  Digitalisation of financial services The digitalisation of financial services could result in new business models or products with disruptive potential in the financial sector. In particular, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to fundamentally change securities and payments business. However, this technology is still in its infancy. There are substantial functional, operational, governance and legal aspects which need to be carefully looked at before thinking about possible mass adoption. Hence, the Eurosystem cannot, at this stage, consider using DLT in the market infrastructure. Nevertheless, we are exploring whether its possible future use could bring benefits. A multitude of different DLT approaches and models could jeopardise financial market integration by increasing fragmentation. Undue periods of market consolidation and standardization could hamper the smooth functioning of a Single Payments Area. We could be in a situation similar to the one that lead to the establishment of T2S.  The next steps in the evolution of the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure The Eurosystem’s strategic reflections on the future development of its market infrastructure centre around three components:   the consolidation of TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities (T2S);  settlement services to support instant payments;  a Eurosystem collateral management system.  Now, these strategic reflections have entered into the next phase. Last week, the Eurosystem decided to launch the investigation phase into these three components. The aim is to ascertain whether there is a business case for each, to agree with the users on the scope of services and to prepare a cost-benefit analysis.  Let me say a few words now on each of the three components.  1. Consolidation of TARGET2 and T2S TARGET2 and T2S are the cornerstones of the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure for payments and securities settlement. But as they were developed at different points in time, they operate on separate platforms and use different technical solutions and environments. Hence, it is logical to seek to draw on the synergies between both systems. Modernising TARGET2, leveraging the possibilities which are already available in T2S and consolidating the technical and functional components of TARGET2 and T2S services are the primary objectives. The Governing Council strongly supports these objectives. In addition, consolidating TARGET2 and T2S provides an opportunity to further improve cyber resilience, to enhance the services offered to users and to establish a single access channel. During the investigation phase of the project, which will run throughout 2017, we will follow up on this year’s market consultation that was launched in February with the release of a consultative report on real-time gross settlement (RTGS) services.  2. Settlement services to support instant payments For the Eurosystem, the biggest challenge of digitalisation in the payments industry is to ensure that the introduction of innovative payment products and services that are developed by the market does not reintroduce fragmentation into the European market. That is why the Eurosystem fosters the development and implementation of pan-European solutions.  One of the most prominent of these innovative services is instant payments. By November 2017 end-user solutions for instant payments in euro should be made available at pan-European level by payment service providers. This means that by November 2017 the European financial market infrastructure has to be ready to clear and/or settle instant payments on a pan-European scale. The Governing Council has decided that it will launch and closely monitor an investigation with market participants on the necessity of extending settlement operating hours for a subset of its regular settlement services up to 24/7/365 to allow for real-time settlement of instant payments.  Instant clearing will be supported by the delivery of an enhanced TARGET2 functionality for the automated clearing houses. The project per se does not question the efforts of the ACHs to offer instant clearing. This is because instant clearing and instant settlement are complementary services (since the availability of instant settlement can make instant clearing less costly). It is true that they are also alternative services (since instant clearing may replace the need for instant settlement and vice versa). Furthermore, the project is the best guarantee that a pan-European solution for the processing of instant payments will be available since TARGET2 is already a pan-European solution. If deemed feasible, it is understood that real-time settlement of instant payments would be offered by the Eurosystem at full cost recovery. As this is a pressing topic, the aim of the investigation is to reach a decision on whether to go ahead with this by the end of the first quarter of 2017 in order to not delay the go-live of announced market initiatives.  3. Eurosystem collateral management system As the euro area’s banking and financial markets become increasingly integrated, demand for more efficient collateral management arrangements within the Eurosystem central bank community is increasing. To date, collateral management in the Eurosystem is rather fragmented as each national central bank has its own procedures and systems in place. As a consequence, some collateral management services are not provided in a fully harmonised manner. As we look to the future, the Eurosystem will strive to drive harmonisation forwards, particularly regarding Eurosystem operations for the mobilisation of marketable assets, as well as the handling procedures for non-marketable assets, which still vary across the central banks. Furthermore, the Eurosystem will investigate, throughout 2017, the business case for and the scope and cost of a possible common Eurosystem collateral management system for managing eligible assets used as collateral in the Eurosystem credit operations.   Conclusion The three components of the Eurosystem’s strategy for the evolution of its market infrastructure are interconnected, such as shared software components, shared network infrastructure, shared hardware components, the use of the future Market Infrastructure Single Gateway. At the end of the investigation into the business case for and the scope and cost of each one, a decision will be taken as to whether they will be developed into projects with different durations. You may rest assured that throughout the investigation and decision, we will live up to the Treaty and our mandate. Thank you.  ']\n",
      "['2016-09-22', 'Mario Draghi', 'Welcome address', 'Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the first annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2016', \"  Welcome address   Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board,at the first annual conference of the ESRB,Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, It is my pleasure to welcome you to the first annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). We have a rich agenda today and tomorrow – one which reflects the value of the ESRB as an institution. The Board brings policymakers together. We have 80 member institutions, each expert in their own field. This diversity of expertise is our strength. The ESRB is uniquely placed to take a holistic view of the European financial system – to see the overarching risks and challenges that would be more difficult for our members to perceive individually.  Sharing knowledge and expertise also permits effective coordination of policy. The ESRB acts as an information hub for the implementation of macroprudential policies for banks, and as a forum to discuss these policies, including their cross-border impact and the possible need to reciprocate them in other jurisdictions. Given its unique Union-wide, cross-sectoral perspective, the ESRB has focused its research on the challenges posed by the structure of the European financial system, and the risks and opportunities arising from ongoing changes to that structure. In that context, let me highlight two themes: the extent of overbanking in Europe and the growth of the non-bank sector.  Overbanking in Europe Two years ago, the ESRB’s Advisory Scientific Committee (ASC) published a widely cited report entitled “Is Europe overbanked?”.[1] It pointed out that, over the preceding two decades, the banking sector had outgrown capital markets. In the late 1990s, the ratio of total bank assets to equity and private bond market capitalisation in Europe was below two. By 2008, this ratio had risen to four. By contrast, the comparable ratio in the US remained below one over this period, and that of Japan remained below two. Banks play a vital role in financing small and medium sized enterprises, which are a key part of the European economy. This lending must continue to flow to productive projects if Europe is to prosper. But bank lending has a tendency to be procyclical: growing too quickly when the economy expands, and shrinking sharply when it contracts[2]. As a result, in the aftermath of a financial crisis economic growth in countries with bank-based systems lags behind that of countries with more balanced financial systems.[3]  The clear policy message is that it is better to finance the real economy through several channels rather than to rely on just one. Capital markets in particular can act as a useful “spare tyre”.[4] That is why the ESRB fully supports the capital markets union, which aims to remove barriers to the development of capital markets.  Removing these barriers will foster changes in the structure of the financial system in Europe. In fact, capital markets and other non-bank sources of external finance have been growing relative to banks.[5] This growth should improve firms’ access to funding, and ensure that any losses are dispersed more widely.   Low bank profitability The overbanking in Europe, highlighted in the ASC’s report, is also a factor in the currently low level of bank profitability. A number of reasons have been mooted as the causes of this low profitability, including low interest rates. Long-term real interest rates have been falling in the major advanced economies for two decades. Technological change, demographics, income inequality and safe asset scarcity are just a few of the factors exerting downward pressure on long-term real rates.[6] Accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank and other major central banks, acting in accordance with their price stability mandates, has also contributed to low interest rates. Low interest rates tend to squeeze net interest margins owing to downward rigidity in banks’ deposit rates.[7] But overbanking is also a factor in the current low level of bank profitability. Over-capacity in some national banking sectors, and the ensuing intensity of competition, exacerbates this squeeze on margins. Such over-capacity also means the sector does not operate at the efficient frontier, which is one reason why cost-to-income ratios remain high in some countries.  At the same time, banks benefit from revaluations in their fixed income portfolios. Moreover, profitability is boosted by a greater flow of lending and lower loan loss provisions than would have occurred in the absence of accommodative monetary policy. Analysis by the ECB suggests that these effects tend to outweigh the impact on net interest income over the short term, but the picture varies depending on banks’ business models.[8] In the broader context of generalised over-capacity and technological innovation, some banks will need to review their business models to bolster profitability. Other financial institutions also face challenges to their business models in this environment.[9] In particular, institutions providing longer-term return guarantees – notably guaranteed-return life insurers – face a future of weak profitability unless they adapt their business models to a changing world. Macroprudential policy can help to boost the collective resilience of these institutions and enhance recovery and resolution frameworks.  Systemic risks beyond banking Let me now turn to the ESRB’s focus on systemic risks beyond banking. As financial intermediation continues to shift from banks to non-banks, we need to adapt our policy framework. We need to identify migrating risks and develop tools to mitigate them.[10]  With this in mind, the ESRB published its first annual EU Shadow Banking Monitor in July.[11] The report identifies a number of areas that require close monitoring, including rising liquidity mismatches, especially among some bond funds. One measure of liquidity mismatch for open-ended funds is the share of non-liquid assets in total assets, which was 38% for bond funds in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 26% six years earlier. In this context, the ESRB is further analysing systemic risks posed by liquidity mismatch and leverage in investment funds.  Moreover, the report identifies considerable interconnectedness between banks and shadow banks, particularly money market funds (MMFs). Approximately two-thirds of MMFs’ total assets are related to banks, mainly in the form of debt securities. This interconnectedness was a key consideration underpinning the ESRB’s recommendation that MMFs should have a fluctuating net asset value, rather than promising a constant one, and that they should be subject to enhanced disclosure and liquidity requirements.[12]   Macroprudential policy beyond banking More generally, the ESRB is analysing connections across different sectors and geographies of the financial system. This cross-cutting analysis informs the development and calibration of macroprudential policy beyond banking. In this way, targeted research enhances the quality of policymaking and thereby improves the resilience of the financial system.  The ESRB believes that the smooth functioning and systemic resilience of derivatives markets can be improved by requiring standardised over-the-counter contracts to be centrally cleared and traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, in line with the commitments made by the G20 in 2009. The EU’s first central clearing obligation came into effect in June this year for certain interest rate derivatives, and will gradually be extended to other transactions. The ESRB is monitoring the effects of this obligation on collateral demand and network structure, and will publish its findings in due course.[13]  The ESRB is also leading research into new macroprudential instruments beyond banking. One policy under consideration is the macroprudential use of margin and haircut requirements.[14] Setting margins and haircuts in a conservative or countercyclical manner may help to contain the excessive build-up of leverage. In addition to “leaning against the wind”, margin and haircut requirements can also improve financial stability by mitigating illiquidity spirals.[15] This is particularly important given that an imbalance between the demand for and supply of liquidity could amplify or transmit shocks through the financial system.  Conclusion Let me conclude. Since the ESRB’s foundation, Europe has strengthened its regulatory, supervisory, and crisis management frameworks. The ESRB has contributed to building a rich set of macroprudential policy tools for banks,[16] and continues to coordinate the calibration of those policies. The European financial system has thus become more resilient, with greater loss-absorbing capacity. The financial system is also adaptive. Its adaptability is a strength, helping it to meet the challenges of the current environment. But it also means that policymakers must remain vigilant. The need for vigilance is why the ESRB has always warned against policy inaction bias. Macroprudential policy is still in its formative years, and policymakers are understandably cautious about deploying novel instruments. But when we see systemic risks, we should act. Greater risk arises from inaction. So as you listen to the presentations at this conference, think about the implications for macroprudential policy in a changing world. Is the macroprudential policy stance appropriate? Are the tools at our disposal effective? Your thoughts and comments will reflect the unique value-added of the ESRB: to bring policymakers together to exchange expertise and coordinate policy action, with the common aim of reducing the risk of financial crisis. On that note, I am pleased to open this first annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board.      [1]Pagano, M., S. Langfield, V. Acharya, A. Boot, M. Brunnermeier, C. Buch, M. Hellwig, A.

Its default unleashed a global financial crisis we still haven’t fully recovered from.  Regulators worldwide responded to the crisis by imposing stricter rules to make the financial system more resilient. Addressing financial sector weaknesses is an important step. When addressing these we need to keep in mind the challenges banks are facing as they adapt to a new operating environment. They face challenges to their business models and to their profitability, they face increasing competition from the non-bank sector and have to contend with new technologies in the payments field as well as new regulations.[1]  Today I want to focus on two of these in greater detail. First, I will consider how the economic environment has made it more difficult for banks in some countries to lend. I will then take a look at the financial regulation and the changes that are still being implemented.  Adapting to the new operating environment has not been easy. Banks have been very vocal critics of tighter regulation and low interest rates, particularly here in Germany. The ECB is aware of this criticism, and of the crucial role banks play in transmitting our accommodative monetary policy stance to the real economy. At the same time, the financial crisis has taught us that banks’ capital and risk buffers were too low and regulation of certain markets needed to be tightened.  Striking the right balance between prudence and pragmatism  We need to learn from the past, which saw the biggest bailout in history, costing European taxpayers almost €2 trillion.[2] Germany’s government, by the way, was one of those in Europe that spent the most to support the country’s financial institutions.  This experience has led to a paradigm shift: from ‘bailout’ to ‘bail-in’. In other words, banks’ shareholders and creditors, rather than taxpayers, will be called on first to bear any losses arising from a bank’s failure. Stronger and more harmonised regulation is necessary, no doubt, but we should not go too far and keep in mind that banks need some leeway to operate effectively.  Implications of the low growth and low interest rate environment  Let’s take a closer look at the economic environment banks are operating in today. Low growth and low inflation are not only European phenomena, but are prevalent in many mature economies around the globe. They are driven by factors such ageing populations, shrinking workforces, rapid technological progress and the aftermath of severe economic downturns.  In the euro area, a mood of uncertainty and a weak economic recovery are holding back investment and bank lending. This mood is informed by geopolitical uncertainties, subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors, the slow implementation of structural reforms in general[3], as well as Brexit and the refugee crisis.  Economic downturns following the financial crisis have, in some euro area countries, exacerbated the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs) for banks. This legacy issue has seriously handicapped their lending to companies and households. The 2014 comprehensive assessment, which for the first time evaluated euro area banks’ assets according to the same standards, identified an upward revision of the estimated non-performing exposures amounting to €136 billion, or 18%. Banks stepped up their provisions accordingly, but the NPL problem cannot be solved with capital alone. The ECB is fully aware of this and is developing guidelines for banks, asking them for example to create operational structures and draw up strategies to manage and ultimately reduce their NPL stock in a timely manner. National authorities need to play their part as well and take the necessary steps to resolve the issue, for instance by making changes to the judicial system.[4]  We cannot afford to waste too much time. High levels of NPLs are paralysing banks, preventing them from passing on the ECB’s monetary stimulus to companies and households, and effectively holding back the recovery in the euro area.  The comprehensive assessment was a starting point and a milestone: it gave us a better idea of the size and the nature of the problem we are facing. We have to be realistic though; improvements will not happen overnight. It will take years. We have to be patient – and determined. The economic environment plays a key role in overcoming the issue. Recessions tend to increase the dimension of NPLs. It is not surprising that the problem is most pronounced in countries with the weakest growth dynamics. Therefore, structural reforms that aim to spur growth are an indispensable precondition to remove the millstone that weighs heavily on the banking sector.  Consistent implementation of bail-in tools Another challenge banks face today is tougher financial regulation. A number of new rules are already in place, while some, for example on bank resolution, have yet to be fully implemented. The global framework for an orderly resolution of failing banks that includes a new standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) will come into force from 2019 for global systemically important banks. On a European level, the resolution authorities still need to set the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) as part of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) for individual banks.  The transposition of the BRRD into national law has also triggered some changes to national insolvency regimes[5], which will lead to the reclassifications of some assets in some countries and to the creation of new asset classes in others.  These changes, which generally aim to protect taxpayers from bank failures in future, may have further implications for banks as they may affect the eligibility of certain assets as collateral for central bank refinancing operations. This in turn could impact on liquidity conditions and the spreads of the respective assets, affecting banks’ refinancing costs.  The statutory subordination of certain senior unsecured bank bonds to other senior debt, as proposed in the adaptation of the German national banking resolution law, for instance, is expected to facilitate resolution and the implementation of the TLAC standards. But it also means that these kinds of bond would no longer be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, according to ECB guidelines.[6] Clearly, any implementation of the BRRD in different ways combined with other upcoming requirements may lead to a re-fragmentation. We are closely monitoring the ongoing regulatory changes in this field. It remains to be seen how they correspond to our rules and, as a result, how they may affect our pool of eligible collateral and ultimately our monetary policy stance. Although we will have to make sure that our operating framework helps to strike the right balance – allowing the banking system to breathe and at the same time avoiding an excessive reliance on the central bank[7] – any coordination of our decisions with regulators would hardly be compatible with central bank independence.  A European perspective will be crucial when working out the final steps in the implementation process. The Commission will need to define a harmonised European approach to reforming national insolvency laws so as to avoid creating new problems while trying to solve old ones.  Conclusion Let me conclude. Eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked the global financial crisis, banks are still adapting to the “new normal” – an environment defined by low growth, low interest rates and stricter financial regulation worldwide.  While it is important to be prudent and learn from past experience, we must apply the lessons we learn in a measured way.[8] The regulatory requirements need to be properly calibrated. Amid all the regulatory changes that seek to strengthen our financial system we must remember to leave banks room for manoeuvre. Banks are crucial: they ensure that our accommodative monetary policy reaches the real economy as they translate lower refinancing costs into more favourable lending conditions for euro area households and companies.  As much as possible, we should aim for European standards rather than national solutions. That way, we can avoid returning to a fragmented set-up prone to arbitrage that provided fertile ground for the financial crisis.  We need to be prudent when learning from the past yet pragmatic when applying such lessons if we are to shape the future in a judicious way.       [1] Y.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, financial globalisation stalled.[1] While it appears to be picking up again on some measures, it is not clear whether this recent episode marks a new era of somewhat lower integration, signals the start of a wider “deglobalisation” trend, or is merely a pause.  For long, the prevailing consensus among economists and international organisations had been that financial globalisation is unconditionally desirable, and a key to development and growth. Recent events – including the global financial and the European sovereign debt crises – shattered that consensus. There is now widespread acceptance that where financial markets are imperfect and regulatory and supervisory policies inadequate, capital inflows can fuel costly boom-and-bust cycles.  I believe that reducing financial integration and restricting capital flows alleviates the symptoms, without addressing the root causes. Worse, the remedy of financial protectionism has – just as with trade protectionism – adverse side-effects of its own that reduce economies’ growth potential. Over time, these adverse side effects may reduce welfare by more than the problems they seek to address. We have to redefine the concept of globalisation. For this, we should adopt policies that allow us to reap the benefits from financial globalisation, while at the same time reduce its risks. Let me call this financial globalisation 2.0.  The key theme of these policies should be that they target the root causes of the risks of capital flows. To best harness the growth potential of financial globalisation, policymakers need to ensure it is efficient, enduring and equitable. Making financial globalisation efficient involves channelling capital flows to productive uses, rather than fuelling inefficient consumption-led boom and busts. Making financial globalisation enduring involves monitoring, and where necessary tilting the composition of flows towards less volatile types and avoiding risky gross positions, reducing the likelihood of sudden stops. And making it equitable involves addressing its distributive impact, both across and within countries. While my talk today is of worldwide relevance, it is particularly pertinent to the euro area. Freedom of movement of capital is one of the four basic freedoms of the single market. Increasing financial integration by completing the capital markets union will help ensure that capital flows to where it can be most productively used to boost growth and employment, while minimising its side effects.   The benefits and risks of financial globalisation   Let me spend a few moments recalling the textbook benefits of financial globalisation. In principle, free capital flows allow for risk sharing and a better allocation of resources across economies.[2] They also help economies to catch up in terms of technology and financial market development through the transfer of knowledge, a critical determinant of growth. In addition to these basic growth channels, economists have pointed out that financial globalisation can foster growth by facilitating risk-sharing and consumption smoothing (particularly at a time of severe demographic challenges), by allowing specialisation, and by imposing external discipline on domestic economic policies.  But recent academic analysis and policy experience, both globally and at the euro area level, have revealed that the story is not quite as simple.[3]  Capital flows can pose risks. They can be volatile and pro-cyclical, fuelling economic and financial cycles, and eventually asset price bubbles.[4] Such bubbles are typically associated with a misallocation of resources, which can persistently drag on growth and employment.[5] And international gross positions can also reflect to a large extent regulatory or tax arbitrage, and therefore arise from an uneven regulatory playing field rather than from an optimal co-operative equilibrium.[6]  The composition of flows has important implications for the likelihood of sudden stops and reversals. In particular, financial globalisation in assets with longer maturity and state-contingent payoffs – such as equity and foreign direct investment (FDI) – has been shown to be less volatile than one based on short-term bank or portfolio flows.[7] FDI is also more desirable as it is much less sensitive to global push factors, such as global risk aversion or monetary policy in major economies.[8] The evidence for positive growth effects of FDI in the literature is much more robust than for portfolio flows.[9]  Furthermore, the focus of the discussion on financial globalisation had typically rested on net flows, as reflected by the current account. However, the global financial crisis has shown that gross, rather than net, international financial flows and positions are crucial for the assessment of financial stability.[10] In particular, financial actors engage in maturity and liquidity transformation within different currencies, regardless of their home lender of last resort, and this opens the door to financial fragility.[11]   The backlash against financial globalisation The challenges posed by financial globalisation and revealed first by regional economic crises in parts of the emerging world, and then by the global financial crisis, have been met by various policy responses. These include the use of so-called capital flow management measures (CFMs), as well as other “hidden” barriers related to regulatory policies. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, a new international consensus on the use of CFMs has emerged. This new view is more open to acknowledging potential benefits of temporary capital flow restrictions.[12] In particular, in circumstances of large and volatile capital flows it may be admissible and more effective to complement appropriate monetary, exchange rate, and prudential policies by temporary and well-targeted CFMs.[13]  But many of the barriers to global capital flows are more indirect and hidden. The build-up of systemic risk on- and off-the-balance-sheet of regulated (and unregulated) intermediaries resulted in a widespread adoption of macro-prudential policies. Certain of these measures have negative side effects on capital flows including: regulatory ring-fencing, currency-based measures, financial repression policies, crisis resolution policies with a national bias, and some financial sector taxes.[14] These barriers, together with the actual or perceived cost of AML/CFT enforcement actions, have led to a retrenchment of cross-border banking flows, evidenced inter alia by the shrinking correspondent banking relationships network.[15]  Indeed, our current version of financial globalisation comes with a number of adverse side effects for the financial sectors of both home and host countries of capital flows. And therefore, some of the imposed policy measures are justified and have reduced systemic risk.  But the general backlash against financial globalisation carries the risk of significantly impairing the efficient functioning of the economy at global, regional and national levels, which make it particularly worrisome. The answer, I believe, is not to put the break on financial globalisation, but transform it by aiming for a higher quality version of it, which for the purpose of this speech I will call financial globalisation 2.0.   Financial globalisation 2.0  There are many elements to successfully implementing financial globalisation 2.0, but I would like to highlight three of them.  First, policymakers need to ensure capital flows are used efficiently where they are most productive.  Second, they need to incentivise state-contingent capital flows so that financial globalisation is enduring and less susceptible to short-term volatility.  Finally, they need to address the distributional impacts of financial globalisation, by reducing international spillovers across countries and mitigating asymmetric impacts within countries so that the benefits are equitably shared by everyone. Let me now elaborate on each of these three dimensions.  The first stage is to put far greater emphasis on improving countries’ absorptive capacity. Financial globalisation should be underpinned with institutional, regulatory and structural reforms that strengthen domestic financial markets, improve their resilience and increase their capacity to efficiently allocate funds to productive uses. Investment in infrastructure and education and structural reforms to promote flexible product and labour markets all increase flexibility in the economy, improving absorption.  This is not a new theme: it was recognised in the wake of the Asian financial crisis that financial openness had to observe the right sequencing, starting with stronger domestic financial systems.[16] But evidence has accumulated and it is now clear that a threshold of institutional development is required in order to allocate incoming flows to productive investment projects.[17]  Given the already close financial integration between member states of the European Union, increased absorptive capacity is vital. In the euro area, in particular, structural reforms, required to support growth and enhance growth potential, will only succeed if capital is reallocated to the most productive sectors.[18] A similar reasoning applies at the global level, with the difference that institutional frameworks can be improved before the financial account is liberalised.  One key element of the necessary institutional framework is legal certainty. An efficient intermediation of foreign savings into productive domestic uses can only occur with a proper and enforceable legal framework in place. In the case of banks, the latter should include reliable legal frameworks for corporate insolvency and for the resolution of non-performing loans (NPLs) which hold down credit growth and economic activity, in particular in Europe.[19]  With more resilient institutional arrangements in place, the second step is to improve the quality of capital flows. Their composition should be tilted away from short-term debt flows towards more enduring longer-term and state-contingent flows. The predominance of easily reversible short-term debt flows in the current context is an equilibrium outcome driven by the risk and return perceptions of independent economic agents.[20] Specifically, investors favour flows that can be quickly reversed where they perceive there to be inadequate financial regulation, weak rule of law and property rights. The euro area crisis has also shown the dangers of a financial integration model based on short-term cross border interbank flows rather than longer-term lending or equity investment, which has led capital to be allocated to low-productivity sectors and sown the seeds of financial instability. But what does tilting the composition towards state-contingent, loss absorbing flows mean in practice? Do we just mean more equity investments or should we also promote innovative state-contingent sovereign debt instruments such as GDP-linked bonds?[21] Such instruments have to date rarely been used in practice – only as part of a debt-restructuring mechanism and some limited issuance of catastrophe bonds. We know little as yet at what prices such instruments could be traded in the market place, and whether the underlying index can be robust enough to create investor trust, as is the case with inflation-linked bonds. To gain such an experience, international financial institutions could play a catalytic role, as potential issuers of GDP-linked bonds.[22]  At the same time, we should carefully reflect upon the trade-offs created by loss-absorbing instruments. First, they might create a conflict between ex-ante and ex-post incentives. Loss-absorbing instruments, while protecting taxpayers and providing the right incentives to investors, might lead to unexpected distributive consequences depending on which investors are ultimately holding these instruments.  Second, issuing more state-contingent liabilities rather than traditional debt instruments might exacerbate the shortage of global safe assets. There is already an excess demand for highly liquid, non-state contingent assets driven in particular by regulatory restrictions, and a rise in risk aversion. A further reduction of their supply can be particularly problematic in an environment in which interest rates are already structurally low and further depressed by a high demand for safe assets.[23]  Let me underline also that, the first two elements necessary to upgrade financial globalisation complement each other. Improvements with respect to corporate governance, the overall quality of the institutional framework and transparency are likely to be helpful in encouraging longer-term flows.[24] In Europe, where more cross-border equity investments are not only desirable from a financial integration but also from a financial development point of view, capital markets union will help achieving these objectives.[25]  The third element in a successful upgrade to financial globalisation 2.0 is to ensure that the benefits are equitably distributed, both across and within countries. The introduction of CFMs represents a push-back against cross-country spillovers caused by financial globalisation. For a recent clear example, consider the impact of the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’, where perceptions of changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy had a marked impact in emerging market economies. Improving the absorptive capacity of these economies and tilting the composition of capital inflows will mitigate these spillovers. But we may need to move towards a regime of greater international cooperation and policy alignment to mitigate the externalities triggered by national policies. The IMF’s search for a wider span of the Global Financial Safety Net can be seen as an effort in this direction. There are also distributional impacts within countries that need to be better addressed. There is a direct parallel here with the debate on trade openness. While the academic literature is more favourable in its assessment of the benefits of trade than for financial globalisation, it also stresses the distributional implications of trade openness. Ideally, the gains of trade globalisation are redistributed by taxation from those made better off to those made worse off. But the current public scepticism, if not outright hostility, towards free trade agreements and the surge in trade restrictions documented by the WTO[26] suggests that that such redistribution is not effective, if at all achieved. Indeed, trade openness and financial globalisation are interconnected. Financial globalisation has made it increasingly easy for multinational corporates to shift their profits to low-tax countries and for wealthy individuals to move funds to undeclared bank accounts in offshore tax havens.[27] This tax avoidance facilitated by financial globalisation has reduced government tax bases worldwide and limited their ability to redistribute the gains from trade integration.  We need to think of ways to co-ordinate better to ensure that the benefits from trade and financial globalisation ultimately accrue to everyone. And working together at the European and at the global level is still the best way to solve the new challenges we face. [28] The popular disenchantment with trade and financial globalisation will not be overturned until governments cooperate better, and it is now quite apparent that such cooperation will not be a loss of sovereignty but will allow them to regain sovereignty over their ability to redistribute wealth equitably. The European Commission’s action plan on fair and efficient corporate tax system in the European Union and investigation into undue tax benefits are steps in this direction.[29] At the global level, similar efforts are taking place with the action plans on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) initiated by the OECD[30].   Conclusion  The question we face today is how financial globalisation should evolve, and whether we should seek to limit it. Because globalisation has evolved to date in a way that has let underlying risks build up and erupt in crises, economic openness has come at the expense of safety. Quite naturally, public opinion is now ready to trade one against the other, and accept less openness for what they believe will make their jobs and income safer. The time has come to make the case that financial globalisation can be made more efficient, enduring and equitable so that it can deliver openness without compromising safety – and to implement it in a convincing way.

      "['2016-09-15', 'Peter Praet', 'Remarks at the BNYM 20th anniversary dinner on the dynamics of TARGET2 balances and monetary policy implementation', 'Dinner address by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the BNYM 20th anniversary, Brussels, 15 September 2016', '  Remarks at the BNYM 20th anniversary dinner on the dynamics of TARGET2 balances and monetary policy implementation   Dinner address by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the BNYM 20th anniversary, Brussels, 15 September 2016 Ladies and Gentlemen,[1]  The focus of my talk this evening is TARGET balances – a relatively arcane topic that has been the subject of intense debate in the past.[2] During the financial and sovereign debt crisis, TARGET balances rose sharply within the euro area linked to rising fragmentation and market stress. And today those balances are trending upwards again. But as I will explain, the current increases should be interpreted differently from those earlier episodes: they are largely a direct result of the asset purchase programme and do not signal renewed stress in financial markets. TARGET2 is the real-time gross settlement system owned and operated by the Eurosystem and TARGET balances are the net claims and liabilities of national central banks vis-à-vis the ECB that arise through cross-border payments settled in central bank money. When a country’s banking sector experiences a net cross-border inflow of central bank money, its TARGET claim increases if it has a positive balance, or its liability decreases if it has a negative balance. Net cross-border outflows of central bank money have the opposite effect, reducing TARGET claims or increasing TARGET liabilities. The total TARGET balance, which is the sum of all positive TARGET balances (or equivalently, the sum of all negative TARGET balances), is only affected when cross-border flows occur between countries with the opposite TARGET position. For example, if a bank located in a country with a TARGET liability makes a cross-border payment to a bank located in a country with a TARGET claim, the TARGET liability of the sending country increases and the TARGET claim of the receiving country increases. The total TARGET balance also increases.[3]  As monetary policy has evolved during the crisis in an effort to ensure price stability and an effective transmission of the policy stance, so too have TARGET balances. The crisis, and the corresponding development of TARGET balances, can be broadly divided into three phases.[4]  In the first phase which followed the Lehman collapse, heightened uncertainty about counterparty credit risk triggered a seizing up of money markets that spread across borders. The Eurosystem responded to banks’ funding needs by introducing fixed-rate full-allotment tenders and extending the maturities of longer-term refinancing operations. In this environment, there was an over-proportional provision of central bank liquidity in jurisdictions where funding needs were more acute. In essence, collateralised liquidity provision by national central banks substituted for private sources of funding that had dried up. Accordingly, the total TARGET balance increased from EUR 100 billion in mid-2007 to around EUR 400 billion by end-2008, around which it fluctuated until the middle of 2011 [Figure 1].  The crisis progressed into its second phase with the emergence of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-12. This led to a renewed intensification of bank funding pressures, but in a much more country-specific way than before. As redenomination risk surfaced, entire national banking systems lost access to wholesale funding markets. Liquidity outflows accelerated from countries perceived as more vulnerable, like Spain, to those perceived as more stable, such as Germany. This triggered a precipitous increase in the total TARGET balance to a peak of over EUR 1 trillion by mid-2012. In the cases of Spain and Germany, their balances hit record highs in August 2012, when Spain had a liability of around EUR 435 billion and Germany had a claim of around EUR 750 billion. This compares with TARGET claims for both Spain and Germany of around EUR 20 billion and EUR 40 billion, respectively, in August 2007. The rise in TARGET balances during these first two phases of the crisis can be viewed as a consequence of severe tensions in funding markets where the Eurosystem accommodated banks’ ensuing liquidity needs. Importantly, however, the link between central bank liquidity provision and rising TARGET balances was indirect. When reserves are injected via repurchase operations, as was predominantly the case in this period, TARGET balances are not directly impacted. The national central bank credits the current account of the borrower and records a loan on the asset side of its balance sheet. Only when private creditors withdrew their funding and banks used the funds obtained from the Eurosystem to replace their faltering volumes of private, mainly wholesale borrowings, did cross-border payments emerge, leading to rising TARGET balances. Not surprisingly, TARGET balances came to be viewed as an indicator of euro area financial market fragmentation, and even a stress indicator for EMU itself. A whole literature emerged to understand and explain TARGET balances.[5]  Following the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions in mid-2012, however, redenomination risk subsided. Banks increasingly repaid central bank credit amid active deleveraging and improved market funding conditions. As such, the Eurosystem’s intermediation role waned and TARGET balances began to decline from late 2012 onwards. But the bank deleveraging process also had another, more pernicious effect: it fed into the renewed macroeconomic downturn in the euro area to produce a vicious circle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics, mirrored by a prolonged downward drift in inflation. This ushered in the third phase of the crisis. In this phase, monetary policy has evolved in response to very low inflation and the need to keep credit flowing to the real economy. This has resulted in the introduction of new instruments, including the asset purchase programme. March 2015 marked a turning point: before that date the injection of central bank reserves had been primarily demand-driven through temporary lending operations. Since then, the bulk of central bank liquidity provision has been via asset purchases rather than repurchase operations. The launch of these asset purchases has caused the direction of TARGET balances to reverse. Having fallen to around EUR 600 billion at the end of 2014, the total TARGET balance is now back to levels of around EUR 1 trillion. But though this upward trend in balances, like the previous episode, is linked to the implementation of monetary policy, the link is now direct rather than indirect. Liquidity injection via asset purchases can immediately impact TARGET balances if it entails a cross-border payment by the purchasing central bank. And here lies the crucial difference to the rise in TARGET balances observed until mid-2012: under the asset purchase programme, TARGET balances are directly affected by the way the programme is implemented, which is independent of financial market stress.  Given the integrated structure of European financial markets, in which the sale and settlement of securities is not confined to national borders, direct cross-border liquidity flows are occurring as a result of the asset purchase programme and the ownership and holding structure of the assets that are being purchased. During settlement, which usually takes place with a custodian or central securities depository, the purchasing central bank receives the security and makes a payment in the form of central bank money. And since cross-border flows of central bank money are what impact TARGET balances, the location through which counterparties participates in the TARGET2 payments system largely determines how the asset purchase programme affects the balances. Counterparties based in the euro area usually connect to TARGET2 using an account held with their national central bank, while non-resident counterparties in countries that do not participate in TARGET2, such as the United Kingdom, may access TARGET2 either directly through a branch in the euro area or indirectly through a correspondent bank. It follows that when a national central bank purchases securities from a non-domestic bank, the purchase is likely to give rise to a cross-border flow of central bank money.[6] As around 80% of Eurosystem purchases by volume have been carried out through non-domestic counterparties, cross-border flows of central bank money are happening on a large scale as a direct result of the asset purchase programme.  Settlement is what ultimately explains the renewed increase in TARGET claims for some countries, like Germany, and in TARGET liabilities for others, like Spain. Under the asset purchase programme, the Eurosystem buys securities from a range of counterparties, including many that are located outside of the euro area and which largely participate in TARGET2 via the Bundesbank, leading to additional inflows of central bank money into Germany as a direct result of the asset purchase programme.[7] So when Banco de España purchases securities from a German counterparty, or from a UK-based counterparty that participates in TARGET2 via Germany, it can give rise to a flow of central bank money from Spain to Germany and affect TARGET balances [Figure 2]. ECB staff estimate that around 60% of purchases by volume under the asset purchase programme have been made from counterparties that participate in TARGET2 via Germany, while only around 5% have been made from counterparties that participate via Spain. It is in this context that Germany’s TARGET claim has increased by around EUR 200 since end-2014 while Spain’s TARGET liability has increased by around EUR 125 billion over the same time period.  At its last meeting, the Governing Council underlined the need to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. This translates into two mutually-reinforcing pledges on our policy course looking forward. First, we say that we expect our policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Second, concerning our asset purchases, we have clarified that we intend to maintain the pace at which we are adding in net terms to our portfolio at €80 billion per month until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Hence, our measures will continue to underpin the momentum of the euro area economic recovery and ensure supportive financing conditions. Against this backdrop, financial market fragmentation will recede further. At the same time, however, it follows from my exposition that TARGET balances are set to continue increasing alongside the asset purchase programme. The ECB will continue to closely monitor developments in TARGET balances, but at the current juncture at least, the upward trend has little to do with the remaining fragmentation or with financial stress.  Figure 1: Total TARGET2 balance (EUR billion)     Source: ECB Notes: The chart reflects the sum of all positive TARGET2 balances.  Figure 2: Stylised illustration of how an asset purchase by a national central bank can affect TARGET2 balances   Example 1: The bond is purchased by Banco de España from a domestic counterparty (no cross-border liquidity flow)  Stylised balance sheet of Banco de España:           Assets   Liabilities    Security purchased under the APP Deposits of banks at Banco de España         No impact on the TARGET2 balance of Banco de España.

The total TARGET2 balance will increase because the flow of liquidity is from a country with a TARGET2 liability (Spain) to a country with a TARGET2 claim (Germany).   The total TARGET2 balance would have remained unchanged if the sending and receiving central banks had the same net TARGET2 position (e.g. if the flow was between two countries with a net TARGET2 liability, like Spain and Italy).

      "['2016-09-13', 'Sabine Lautenschläger', 'Monetary policy in uncertain times - the ECB and the crisis', 'Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Parliamentary evening in Strasbourg, 13 September 2016', '  Monetary policy in uncertain times – the ECB and the crisis   Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Parliamentary evening in Strasbourg, 13 September 2016 All beginnings are difficult. It’s true of monetary policy as well.  Let’s consider for a moment Europe’s first central bank. In 1656 Johan Palmstruch founded Stockholm Banco, introduced paper money and triggered an economic crisis. What happened? At the outset Stockholm Banco conducted normal banking operations: it took deposits and made loans. The deposits at that time mainly consisted of copper coins, and the most common denomination weighed almost 20\\xa0kg.  But in 1662 the Swedish state issued new coins which contained less copper. The old coins stored at Stockholm Banco thus became more valuable and the depositors asked for them back. The bank then found itself with a serious liquidity problem because the desired coins had been issued as loans.  Faced with this situation, Johan Palmstruch had an idea – an idea with consequences. Those who asked for their coins back received paper money instead. This paper money was backed by the copper coins, which had not disappeared but had simply been lent out.  The people and the state accepted the paper money; the crisis was averted. At the same time, Stockholm Banco could now make loans in the form of paper money.  It then did that, but somewhat too generously: it produced more paper money than were backed by the coins. The people lost trust in the value of the paper money and Sweden experienced inflation. To control it, Stockholm Banco stopped issuing loans and paper money. This in turn led to an economic crisis.  In 1667 the Swedish state shut down Europe’s first central bank.  In the 350 years since, we have gained theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Today any first-year economics undergraduate could warn Stockholm Banco about the dangers of its policy. While monetary policy was more art than science in the early days, now it is more science than art. But all that experience and all that knowledge cannot prevent monetary policymakers even now suddenly finding themselves in difficult terrain. For it’s not only monetary policy that has a major influence on economic growth and other important factors for the central bank, but also businesses, banks and other market participants as well as governments; thus, they too influence price stability.   Uncertain times Looking back over the recent past, we see a decade of crisis and uncertainty; we see a whole series of “black swans” – events that could not be foreseen.  We see how the insolvency of an American investment bank triggered a global financial crisis. We see a global economic crisis, a European sovereign debt crisis and we see how the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Brexit was an event that few people had reckoned with, surely; an event that has heightened economic uncertainty and that may damage the economy.  Although it is still too early to draw any definitive conclusions about the effects of Brexit on the economy, our current forecasts are incidentally offering an encouraging picture. The impact seems to be smaller than many had feared. But it is in everyone’s interest to pass through this phase of political uncertainty as soon as possible. Crises now seem to have become part of everyday life and the improbable has become the norm. In such times of uncertainty monetary policy serves as an important anchor of stability.  However, the crises of the last few years have also pushed monetary policy into uncharted territory. To achieve the goal of stable prices, it has followed new paths.  Monetary policy in uncertain times – finding new ways to the old goal The journey started in a way that is far from new. Following the failure of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008, banks found themselves to be objects of deep mistrust. They could hardly assess their own risks, let alone the risks of other banks. As a result, they stopped lending to each other and even solvent banks could no longer refinance themselves. At this point, the ECB jumped in and became the lender of last resort.  Basically, this is not a new role for a central bank, but one of its original tasks. It goes back to 1873 and Walter Bagehot, who wrote that “to stem a financial panic, [...] the central bank should lend freely at a penalty rate to solvent institutions against good collateral”. The ECB has done that. It has offered the banks unlimited liquidity and extended the maturities of the relevant loans.  At the same time, it has expanded the list of eligible collateral. As a lender of last resort the ECB managed to help the banking system get through the first phase of the crisis. When the crisis started, the ECB also reduced interest rates. Initially, this wasn’t a new path either, but standard practice for monetary policy.  The lower interest rates are, the more attractive it is for companies to invest and for people to consume. Demand goes up and so do prices. The ECB entered unfamiliar territory in June 2014 when it reduced the deposit rate for banks to below a level previously regarded as a barrier: the “zero lower bound”, as it is called.  A slow economic recovery and persistently low inflation had made that necessary. Banks are therefore now having to pay interest on their deposits at the ECB. It may seem strange to many people to have to pay someone you’re lending money to. And that’s exactly what it’s all about: the individual bank should have an incentive to lend its money elsewhere, for example to companies. This is one effect of negative interest rates.  The second effect concerns investors’ expectations. They now know that short-term interest rates can fall below zero. Knowing this, they adjust downwards their interest rate expectations for the future and long-term interest rates fall. This boosts the desired effect on investment and consumption. However, it is precisely these negative rates that have triggered a lively debate in Germany. There is much talk of “penalty rates” which are hurting savers and thus undermining monetary policy. I can make four comments on this. In the first place, the ECB does not set interest rates in an arbitrary fashion. Interest rates always reflect the economic situation – and that is influenced by things other than monetary policy, by labour market policy, tax policy and fiscal policy, for example.  Raising interest rates in the current situation would benefit nobody, ultimately not even savers or banks: the recovery in Europe would slow down, unemployment would rise and inflation would fall further. This would not only worsen the banks’ situation, but also increase the risk of deflation. The second point applies to savers: a 3% interest rate with 3% inflation is exactly the same as a 0% interest rate with 0% inflation, although for many people it might feel different.  It’s what remains at the end that matters, and that is the real interest rate. The real interest rate is that part of the interest rate which is not absorbed by inflation. And if we look at real interest rates, the current situation is not that unusual. Real interest rates in Germany between 1974 and 1981 and between 1989 and 1994 were almost always negative – it just felt different because the interest rates on paper were positive.  Third, savers are naturally not very enthusiastic about the return on their savings – I feel the same.  However, we shouldn’t overlook all those who should be pleased to have very low interest rates. Anyone who takes out a loan to build a house or to invest in a business idea benefits. With rising interest rates the opposite would be true – savers would gain and borrowers would bear the burden.  Currently, the overall effect is neutral: the average net interest income of households in the euro area has not changed.[1]   Fourth, in fact, not only savers, but also banks are affected by the low interest rates – their interest income is coming under pressure. It is argued that this effect could ultimately undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy. When the income accruing to banks falls too sharply, they could have no alternative but to issue fewer loans or demand higher interest rates on loans. That would be the opposite of what monetary policy is trying to achieve. This brings us to the absolute lower limit for interest rates. This limit is reached once the desired effect of the negative rates goes into reverse – either because lending suffers or because banks and individuals start to hoard cash. But we don’t seem to have reached the absolute lower limit yet. Since mid-2014, borrowing conditions for businesses and households have improved, and loan growth is recovering. At the same time, the money supply is showing no signs of cash hoarding by individuals or banks.[2]  But should we feel obliged to cut interest rates even more, just because the absolute lower limit has not been reached?  I don’t think so.  Conditions on the financial markets have significantly improved and economic growth is back on track – the slight effect of Brexit shows how robust the recovery is. Against this background I have my doubts about the benefits of further interest rate cuts – especially when we compare the benefits with the costs. Negative interest rates have both a desired effect and undesired side effects. These include not only the burden on savers, banks and insurance companies but also the risk of reducing the pressure to reform on policymakers as well as the risk of creating asset price bubbles. Such measures should only be taken as and when it is really necessary and the cost-benefit analysis is still positive. To sum up, despite these risks and side effects I still consider negative rates to be justified at the moment. But going beyond that I’m sceptical about further interest rate reductions. The ECB has been stepping into unfamiliar territory with another instrument – how have things been going in that respect?  When, in the second half of 2014, the medium-term outlook for the economy worsened and inflation expectations fell back, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to purchase bonds – initially government bonds and then also corporate bonds. This programme is intended to support the other measures by additionally lowering long-term interest rates via various channels and at the same time it gives a signal that monetary policy is committed to its goal of stable prices.  What we are already seeing is that the bond purchases have helped to further improve borrowing conditions for businesses and households. It is however too early to analyse statistically the unfolding effects on growth and inflation. But analyses based on theoretical models have shown that the programme may have an effect – even though the degree of effectiveness is uncertain.[3]  But here too it’s true that strong medicine has side effects. Particularly in Germany many people are understandably worried that the side effects could be greater than the intended effects, especially over the long term.  The critics of the purchase programme are saying that it distorts debt markets, reduces the pressure on governments to reform, blurs the boundary between monetary policy and government financing, and threaten financial stability in the long run. As I said, we will therefore need to be patient for a while before being able to make a final assessment of the purchase programme. What matters now is to give the measures time to work.  That’s why I see no reason at the moment to change the key design elements of the purchase programme.  Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, the crises of the past few years have thrust monetary policy into unknown territory.  But we are far from the times of Banco Stockholm, when there was no clear objective for monetary policy, no theoretical basis and no experience of such matters. Yes, the crisis has pushed monetary policy into uncharted territory, but we have a clear objective and we know where we are thanks to theory and experience. However, in recent years we have done a lot for the first time. The key question is whether our package of measures works – and it’s only as a package that the effect can be assessed. Have we come nearer to our objective of bringing inflation back to a stable level of close to, but below, 2%? What we are seeing is that conditions on the financial markets are improving – I mentioned that earlier with regard to the individual measures. And when the conditions on the financial markets improve, the ground is prepared for a return to higher inflation. So monetary policy is working. We are approaching our goal, albeit by following new paths.  But we must not overlook two things.  First, the individual measures cannot be continued indefinitely – at some point, for example, interest rates will hit their absolute lower limit.  Second, the measures cannot be continued indefinitely – at some point the effect of the measures will get weaker and the risks will predominate. In my view instead of new and always more extreme measures we need a little patience. We should not forget that returning inflation to just under 2% is a medium-term goal. Our current projections see inflation in 2018 back at 1.6%.  Ladies and gentlemen, price stability is a necessary condition for growth and prosperity, and the ECB is doing everything to ensure it. But monetary policy alone cannot build factories or create jobs or balance national budgets. It can only create the right conditions for these things. Ultimately, it’s up to governments. They have to complete the necessary economic reforms, strengthen the institutional foundation of Economic and Monetary Union and bring these times of uncertainty to an end.

His character and his experience provide us with an inspiring message, loud and confident: “In Europe we go forward together in freedom”. This message is rooted in the 20th century history of our continent.  The raison d’être of any government is to provide security for its citizens, both physically and economically. And in democratic societies, that means providing safety and security by preserving individual liberties and individual rights, by promoting social fairness and equal opportunities. The statesmen who, after World War Two, looked back over the preceding half-century could reach only one conclusion: that the governments which emerged from nationalist and populist movements, and which were carried into power by a mixture of charisma and lies, completely failed to offer their citizens security, fairness and freedom. They had betrayed the very reason for their existence.  In outlining the future shape of international relations, De Gasperi and his contemporaries concluded that only cooperation between European governments within a common organisation could ensure the joint security of their citizens.  They saw that implanting democracy in the nations of Europe would not be enough. Europe also needed democracy among nations. They understood that building barriers between countries would make them more vulnerable and less secure, not least due to their geographical proximity; and that withdrawing behind one’s borders would make governments less effective.  De Gasperi’s vision of how this joint process should be shaped was articulated in various speeches he gave in those years.  Common challenges should be addressed via supranational instead of intergovernmental strategies. Speaking to the assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1954, De Gasperi noted that “…from 1919 to 1939, some seventy international treaties were concluded – and all became mere pieces of paper when it came to their implementation” because of the lack of “joint control of common resources”.[1] And the experience of politicians was validated by distinguished economists, such as Ragnar Nurkse, who showed how those treaties ended up fostering protectionism.[2]  Integration above all had to meet the immediate needs of the people. As De Gasperi observed, “We must begin by pooling only what is strictly essential to the achievement of our immediate aims, and do this by means of flexible formulae which can be gradually and progressively applied”. [3]  And joint action had to be focused on areas where, evidently, individual action by governments was not sufficient: joint control over the raw materials of war, in particular coal and steel, was one of the first examples.  In this way, the founders of the European project were able to pair effectiveness with legitimacy, since the process was legitimised by both popular consensus and the support of governments. It was focused on areas where the action of European institutions and the benefits for the people were directly and visibly related. And joint action did not limit the authority of governments, but rather buttressed it, and thus found their backing. But it was not only the disastrous experience of the past that motivated De Gasperi and his contemporaries. It was also the immediate successes which were made possible by the initial decisions of the post-war period.   The achievements of working together The establishment of peace – the crowning achievement of the European project – immediately produced growth and laid the foundation for prosperity. Set against this was the devastation wrought by the two world wars. Real GDP per capita fell by 14% during World War One and by 22% during World War Two, wiping out many of the gains that had been made during the preceding years. Economic integration built on peace in turn produced significant improvements in living standards. Since 1960 cumulative growth in real GDP per capita has been 33% higher in the EU15 than in the US. Incomes in poorer European countries have also converged towards those enjoyed by richer ones.  And EU citizens have gained the right to live, work and trade throughout the Union – and to benefit from equal protection, wherever they are, provided by European courts of law. Indeed, the process of coming together in a single market, one of the greatest achievements of the European project, was never solely about increasing market integration and efficiency. It was above all a choice of values of a free, open society – a choice made by the people of the European Union. The European project has firmly established political freedoms, too. From the outset the promotion of free democracy has been at its heart. As a guarantor of democratic principles, the EU has acted as a point of reference for countries eager to escape dictatorships or totalitarianism, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain or those of central and eastern Europe. The Copenhagen criteria and the Charter of Fundamental Rights ensure that all EU countries respect a set of well-defined political principles enshrined in national and European law.  There is no doubt that these freedoms have contributed immensely to the well-being of Europe. And it is because of these freedoms that many migrants and refugees are looking for a better future in the European Union today.  In short, European integration has provided its citizens with physical and economic security – perhaps for longer than ever in the history of Europe – while also spreading and instilling the values of an open society. The founders who began this process, and we who have carried it on, have demonstrated to the world that freedom and security are not mutually exclusive. By consolidating democracy we have secured peace.   New challenges for Europe The more recent years of the European project have been characterised, however, by growing dissatisfaction. This was expressed perhaps most clearly in the referendum on 23 June, when the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. For some EU countries, these years have entailed the most serious economic crisis since the war, with unemployment, especially among the young, reaching unprecedented levels and welfare states constrained by low growth and stretched public finances. It has been a time when, in an ageing continent, uncertainty has grown about the sustainability of our pensions systems. And a time when large-scale migration has called into question established ways of life and long-accepted social contracts, and stirred up feelings of insecurity and defensiveness.  The disaffection certainly has other causes, too. The end of the Soviet Union and of the nuclear threat it posed has diverted attention from the notion of “safety in numbers”. The shifting balance of power among the largest nations; ongoing urgent geopolitical tensions, wars and terrorism; climate change and the effects of continual, inexorable technological progress – all of these factors have, in a short period of time, interacted with the economic consequences of globalisation and intensified feelings of insecurity, especially in a world that was inattentive to how the extraordinary benefits of that globalisation were being distributed.  Indeed, while in emerging economies globalisation has liberated hundreds of millions of people from crushing poverty, in advanced economies the real incomes of those in the lower half of distribution have remained at the same level as a few decades ago. It is not surprising then that many have felt left behind. Anxiety is growing.  The policy responses to this have at times been reminiscent of the interwar period: isolationism, protectionism, nationalism. And this also happened in previous eras. At the end of the first phase of globalisation, in the early 20th century, several countries, including those with a tradition of immigration, such as Australia or the United States, introduced restrictions on immigrants, in reaction to fears among workers that new entrants who were willing to accept lower pay would take away their jobs. But while such policy responses can be justifiably rejected, it must not prevent us from reviewing how the mode of European integration itself has also contributed to disaffection. Here again, De Gasperi’s own prescient words help us understand what has happened:  \"If we restrict ourselves to creating shared institutions, without a higher political will invigorated by a central body in which the wills of nations come together (...) we risk the possibility that compared with the various national strengths, this European venture may seem cold and lifeless – it could even at times appear a superfluous and even oppressive extravagance\". [4]  The structure of the European Union is solid and its fundamental values remain its base. But the integration process needs to be guided towards outcomes that are more efficient and more directly aimed at the people, their needs and their fears – and less focused on institution-building. European institutions are not accepted per se by the people, but only as necessary instruments to provide those outcomes.  Yet on other occasions it has been institutional incompleteness that has prevented authorities from being able to handle the challenges arising from external shocks. Consider the Schengen Agreement. It largely abolished Europe’s internal borders, but it did not envisage a strengthening of the continent’s external borders. So when the migration crisis erupted, it was seen as a destabilising loss of security.  The response of both the European Union and the Member States to these needs and fears has so far been insufficient. Surveys show that, together with a drop in support for economic integration, trust in both the European Union and even more so the Member States has fallen.[5]  This does not apply only to Europe. The data show that in the US, too, people’s trust has declined in almost all institutions, including the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court.[6] The fact that this is a worldwide phenomenon cannot however exonerate us Europeans, because we are the only group of people in the world to have built a supranational polity in the certainty that it was indispensable to provide security where individual countries could not.  Is Europe still the answer? So the question is simple, but fundamental: is working together still the best way to solve the new challenges which we face?  For various reasons the answer is an unequivocal yes. If those challenges are continent-wide, acting exclusively at national level is not enough. And if they are global, collaboration between the Member States gives Europe a strong voice. The recent climate change negotiations serve as an example. This global issue can only be addressed through internationally coordinated policies. And the critical mass of Europe speaking with one voice has produced results well beyond the reach of individual countries. Only the pressure exerted by European countries forming a common front was able to make the Paris climate conference a success. And only the EU’s existence allowed that common front to be built.  In a world where technology is diminishing physical barriers, Europe is exerting influence in other ways too. Its ability, with its market of 500 million consumers, to impose global recognition of property rights, or respect for privacy rights on the internet, is obviously stronger that any of its members could hope for alone.  National sovereignty remains in many respects the fundamental element of each country\\'s government. But for challenges that transcend national borders, the only way to preserve sovereignty – that is, to make the voice of citizens heard in a global context – is for us Europeans to share sovereignty within the European Union, which has served as a multiplier of our national strength. And where responses can only be provided at the supranational level, we should adopt the same approach that allowed De Gasperi and his contemporaries to secure legitimacy for their actions: we should focus on those actions that deliver tangible and immediately recognisable results. There are two kinds. The first kind of action is to complete those initiatives that are already under way, because stopping half-way is the most dangerous option. We would partially disempower national states without creating – at Union level – the capacity to provide at least as much security to the people.  The process of opening borders requires common institutions to safeguard freedom and fairness among its members. A free and single market is not anarchy: it requires that all its members are subject to the same laws and rules; and that they all have recourse to the same courts where those laws can be applied uniformly. This is why a true single market is a political construct. And if those institutions do not exist or do not function properly, borders will ultimately be restored to provide the security that people demand. Thus to protect the single market in all its forms – and the commitment to an open society which it represents – it has to be completed. What is different from the past, however, is that today we must devote more attention to the redistributive aspects of integration, and especially to those people who have paid the highest price. I do not think there will be significant progress in terms of opening up markets and competition if Europe does not listen to the demands of those left behind by a society built on the pursuit of wealth and power; if Europe, as well as being a catalyst for integration and an arbiter of its rules, does not also moderate its outcomes.  That moderating role is today assigned to nation states, yet in many cases they are lacking the strength to fulfil it fully. It is a task that has not yet been defined at the EU level. But a greater role for the EU would satisfy the characteristics that De Gasperi identified: buttressing the activities of governments and therefore legitimising European action. Recent discussions about tax fairness and a European unemployment insurance fund, about professional retraining funds and other projects with the same idealistic goals, all go in this direction. But because Europe should only act where the national governments are unable to act alone, the response must still come first and foremost from the national level. We need policies that unleash growth, reduce unemployment and empower individuals, while offering essential protections for the most vulnerable. For the second kind of action, if and when we initiate new common projects in Europe, they should adhere to the same criteria that brought success 70 years ago: they must be based on a consensus that action is truly necessary; the projects should complement the actions of governments; they should be clearly linked to people’s immediate concerns; they should unequivocally concern matters of European or global significance.  If these criteria are applied, there are many areas in which Europe does not need to get involved. But there are also important areas where it clearly needs to, and where European initiatives are not just legitimate, but even essential. Today this notably includes the fields of migration, security and defence. Both types of action are essential because unresolved internal divisions, for instance concerning the completion of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), are likely to distract us from addressing the new geopolitical, economic and environmental challenges. This is a real danger in Europe today – and it is one we cannot afford. We need to find the strength and wisdom to resolve our differences and go forward together. To do that we need to rediscover the spirit that led a small number of great leaders, in much more difficult conditions than we face today, to overcome mutual suspicion and succeed jointly instead of failing separately. So to conclude, let me quote again Alcide De Gasperi, whose words resonate as much today as they did in 1952:  \"Economic cooperation is, of course, a matter of compromise between the natural desire for independence of each participant and overriding political aspirations. If European economic cooperation were dependent upon the compromises put forward by the various administrations concerned, we should probably be led into weaknesses and inconsistencies. So it is the political aspiration for unity which must prevail. We must be guided above all by the overriding realisation that it is essential to build a united Europe in order to ensure for ourselves peace, progress, and social justice\".

As the European Union (EU) approaches the 25th anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty, it finds itself at a crossroads. The multiple crises that have challenged Europe’s stability, prosperity and security have undermined people’s trust in the EU. But this is not only a European phenomenon. Nationalistic and xenophobic movements in other parts of the world are vigorously opposing mainstream politics and established politicians. Let’s not forget Churchill’s remark that a referendum tells us less about the question and more about the questioner.  After eight years of crises and subdued growth the issue is about the divide between the haves and the have-nots. On the one hand, globalisation and open borders have created benefits that are perceived to have been appropriate by the well-connected few. On the other hand, the burden-sharing needed to keep our financial systems afloat and preserve our regional community is also perceived as being unfair. The easy way out is to blame EU institutions. Indeed, the EU Commission, the EU Council and the Council of Ministers take many decisions that affect our daily lives. But they are not democratically elected and they cannot be sanctioned either. In this context, the outcome of the UK’s EU referendum is triggering a debate not just on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, but also – and perhaps more importantly – on how to improve the functioning of the EU and of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) as one of its key elements.  I have a central banker’s perspective, and I believe that the stability of a currency requires trust, cohesion and an ability to act as and when necessary. So today I will be considering how we could boost support and strengthen the institutional arrangements for European integration. When thinking about what needs to be changed, it is also important to build on the EU’s strengths and to protect our collective achievements. They are too often forgotten: some people ask, what has the EU actually achieved? As if there was no good response.  We benefit from the dividends of our Union day in, day out: peace, democracy and the preservation of economic wealth across the continent based on the four freedoms. In this respect, the EU and its institutions provide a forum where we can settle disagreements in a civilised manner and arrive at joint decisions. EU law protects our most fundamental principles and exercises significant normative power internationally. In material terms, the EU has facilitated a level of prosperity unprecedented in European history, if only because by ensuring peace it prevented the strife and destruction of the past.   Our economic union also brings very concrete benefits. The EU brings freedom – the freedom to study, travel, work, invest and do business across the continent. In opinion polls, this is considered the most positive result of the EU, alongside peace. Moreover, the euro is a very tangible European public good that is perhaps the strongest guarantee that we will stand together even in times of crisis. Support for the euro and EMU is very high in the euro area, in fact much higher than support for the EU. The crisis tested our political commitment, and this commitment was reaffirmed. Indeed, European integration has brought fundamental benefits. People believe in Europe and European public goods when they are tangible and deliver results. However, we also need to fully acknowledge the shortcomings of the status quo. For many, Europe is a proxy for globalisation, which has created prosperity as well as strong interconnections. Our economies are so intertwined that they can only be disentangled with great difficulty. Consider the complex discussions under way in the UK on how to separate from the EU. Can borders protect us from capital flows, demographic ageing, secular trends in capital return, lower equilibrium interest rates or migration due to wars and human misery? For individuals it is increasingly difficult to distinguish origins at national, at European and at global level. The distortions and half-truths of the Brexit debate has shown that, first, complexity, second, uncertainty about pensions, third, low growth, and fourth, income distribution, offer fertile ground for extremists. Economically, the pace of recovery in the euro area remains unsatisfactory, with unemployment levels still too high. This is reflected in opinion polls on the economy and on the outlook for the months to come. It is clear that efforts to strengthen the recovery have to be undertaken. In the financial sector, remaining fragilities in the banking sector need to be fixed and the banking union completed. Otherwise, market participants will continue to fear that local vulnerabilities could eventually spread and destabilise the European banking system before all the firefighting tools are ready to be deployed. The aim must be to move forward swiftly on both risk reduction and risk sharing. Risk sharing involves both the public and private sectors, for example by ensuring the same level of deposit protection through a European deposit insurance scheme, but also by continuing to build a capital markets union in Europe. The EU and EMU also need to face up to their institutional weaknesses. On average, people’s trust in both national and EU political institutions is very low. As regards the   national level  , we know from the economic literature that strong institutions are crucial for sustainable economic growth and governance indicators suggest that there is room for improvement in many Member States.  As regards the European level, the gap between people’s expectations and the EU’s institutional setup is widening:    First, the perceived legitimacy of the EU remains low. The EU is not regarded as ‘efficient’ and only a minority of citizens feel that their voice counts in the EU.  Second, opinion polls suggest that citizens are not opposed to European decision-making. Specifically, they want the EU to concentrate on their key concerns, notably to protect them better from economic and security risks, and to provide solutions.  When responding to these expectations, the EU and EMU face however two challenges:   The first has to do with subsidiarity: it should be made clearer where the EU has an advantage over Member States in terms of exercising competence and where not. A better demarcation of competences between the European and national level is desirable – but not easy. Loose coordination at European level may give the impression that a competence has been passed to the European level, when in fact it continues to be exercised by Member States. The result tends to be that the EU gets blamed for apparently seeking to interfere in national affairs when in fact it does not effectively have the power to do so. It should not be so surprising that in such situations the practical result is a lack of coherent action across the EU. This, in my view, means that responsibilities and accountability lines should be more clearly defined and assigned, as Europe has done with the single monetary policy and the creation of the European Central Bank.  The other challenge has to do with intergovernmentalism. The rationale for the intergovernmental approach is to ensure that decisions respect national interests. The risk is however that decision-making becomes a diplomatic exercise, resulting in protracted and opaque negotiations, a lack of long-term strategies and national interests being pitted against each other. However, it is an outdated belief that the nation state is the sole locus of legitimacy. The EU is not only a union of Member States but also of citizens. Where competences are assigned to the European level, they should be part of the Union method, with clear executive powers, full democratic accountability and rigorous judicial arrangements at that level. This also means that the EU’s agenda should be set by those who were duly elected at European level rather than by a few large Member States. In my view, this would also have to be an essential principle guiding any future treaty revision.  Decision-making on taxation and public spending is the core prerogative of national parliaments, and for good reason, but that does not mean that we should shy away from further fiscal integration in the long run. We just need to get it right. One of the ideas currently being discussed is a euro area treasury that would be responsible for fiscal policy decisions at European level. Such a treasury or finance ministry would clearly need a high degree of democratic legitimacy and strong parliamentary control. Any college with powers delegated from intergovernmental forums would hardly satisfy those requirements. In my view, the European Parliament convening in euro area composition would be the right body to undertake this task. It would ensure that the actions of a European finance minister are legitimised at the same level at which decisions are taken.  A common mistake is to underestimate the EU’s achievements and the strength of support for tangible European projects such as the euro. But for the EU to regain the trust of its citizens, it needs to be properly equipped to handle destabilising events and respond to people’s expectations. Trust in the currency can also be undermined by extreme measures which have unacceptable side effects. An independent central bank must be able to explain its actions and take account of political economy considerations. Some academic proposals seem to prefer sophisticated models to social psychology. We cannot fulfil our mandate with mathematical equations, but only with instruments that maintain trust in the currency. Extreme measures or legal violations of our mandate are not among those instruments.  ']\n",
      "['2016-08-31', 'Peter Praet', 'Financial cycles and monetary policy', 'Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, in the context of a panel on “International Monetary Policy”,Beijing, 31 August 2016', '  Financial cycles and monetary policy   Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, in the context of a panel on “International Monetary Policy”,Beijing, 31 August 2016 Financial asset prices and credit creation in the global economy are characterised by pronounced and recurrent ebbs and flows – a pattern we have come to refer to as the financial cycle.[1] In my remarks today, I will discuss the role of monetary policy and other policy domains in steering this cycle.[2]  Financial cycles derive from two closely related factors. The first is a natural tendency towards occasional bouts of “irrational exuberance” – for instance in response to promising scientific discoveries or technological advances – that lead investors to radically upgrade their future income expectations. The second factor is the capacity of financial intermediaries to transfer this expected increase in future income into the present through credit creation, thus establishing a financial upswing that constitutes the real-world counterpart to the upswing in economic optimism.  But when some of the expected benefits that investors ascribed to the new discoveries or technologies do not come to pass, this process goes in reverse. A period of collective retrenchment ensues and the financial cycle enters into a downswing.  Such cycles, while certainly painful for individual investors, are not necessarily harmful for the economy as a whole: productivity growth and technological progress rely on investments in promising but risky ventures, which are driven by entrepreneurial zeal and often financed by credit. As such, financial exuberance often acts as a by-product of economic progress.[3] But this is not always the case: some asset price bubbles, for example in housing markets, may go along with a misallocation of resources and lower productivity growth. And in all instances the flip-side of financial exuberance is an increased risk of regular, and potentially violent, reversals[4] – a pattern we have seen repeatedly in history, going back at least to the Dutch Tulip Mania in 1636.[5]  Hence, for policymakers concerned with financial stability, financial cycles present two related questions. First, how should they identify when it is justified to intervene in the cycle? And second, if intervention is justified, which policy domain should act?  Criteria for policy intervention A key criterion to identify the case for pre-emptive policy intervention is the presence of systemic negative externalities. In the most general terms, such externalities arise whenever the costs of failed endeavours are not only borne by those who stood to benefit from the initial risk-taking activity, but also spill over to the wider financial sector and economy. Though they have macroeconomic consequences, these externalities typically originate from misaligned incentives at a microeconomic level – for instance pervasive moral hazard that induces agents into excessive risk-taking in their contractual relations. Not all such market failures are relevant for financial stability, but insofar as they aggregate up to a systemic level they may become relevant. There is one specific embodiment of such externalities that has proven in the past to be particularly deleterious. This relates to the tendency for financial intermediaries to adopt unstable and run-prone funding patterns – a tendency that was particularly pronounced in the run-up to the last financial crisis when financial intermediaries, including depository but also non-depository institutions that operate in non-bank forms of intermediation such as the repo market, increasingly funded their exposures in the wholesale market.  These intermediaries had an incentive to reap liquidity premia that other investors were willing to pay for short-term assets that could be readily converted into currency and thus to finance long-term asset exposures with very short-term funding. This pattern of funding, however, exposes the system to fire-sale damage in case of a run on such short-term funding instruments. The externality, in turn, resides in the failure of financial intermediaries to internalise this fire sale damage, which affects the broader economy and not just the institutions engaging in such funding patterns.  Accordingly, when assessing the implications of swings in the financial cycle, the key issue for policymakers is not so much to diagnose irrational exuberance as to identify its funding patterns – namely, whether rising asset prices are being fuelled by excessive leverage and maturity transformation which will have systemic consequences when the cycle turns.  When such risks to financial stability are identified, however, the second question becomes salient: which policy domain should act to quell financial exuberance?   Responsibilities for managing the financial cycle To my mind the first line of defence must be a strong institutional and legal framework that directly targets the sources of market failure.  Such a framework would include sound financial regulation and macroprudential policy tools that limit excessive risk-taking in the boom and make banks more resilient to losses in the bust, for instance through higher, and potentially counter-cyclical, capital requirements, leverage limits and stable funding ratios. It would include strong resolution frameworks for banks and insolvency regimes to accelerate deleveraging and balance sheets repair after a crash. And it would include effective regulatory frameworks in other non-financial policy domains – especially in the housing market which has often acted as a key amplifier of financial boom and bust cycles. Housing bubbles, for example, can be fuelled by rigid zoning and land use regulations which cap housing supply, coupled with permissive underwriting standards for mortgages which stoke housing demand.[6]  In other words, ensuring financial stability requires the commitment of many policy actors – supervisors, regulators, governments – all of whom have to act in their own areas of responsibility.  But it is clear to me that central banks also have a role to play. Monetary policy inevitably interacts with the financial cycle – a view that has been borne out by a large and growing body of empirical evidence.[7] This interaction derives from the powerful impact that monetary policy can exert on risk-taking incentives, especially of financial intermediaries. Insofar as financial and business cycles are in sync, this may either magnify or moderate the ups and downs of financial markets.[8] And the interactions extend well-beyond country borders, since monetary policy affects yields and asset prices both in its domestic economy and, through portfolio balance effects, in foreign economies. Through these channels, monetary policy in large advanced economies can have a significant impact on financial stability elsewhere, especially in emerging markets.[9]  Importantly, this interaction does not weaken the case for a strong first line of defence. The alternative would be to rely on monetary policy to compensate for failures in other policy domains. But this would overburden monetary policy and lead to sub-optimal outcomes with regard to both – financial stability and broader macroeconomic stabilisation objectives; and this holds not only at the domestic level but also internationally. In fact, a large body of empirical work in recent years has shown that fiscal, macro-prudential, regulatory and supervisory policies can help mitigate the adverse effects of foreign monetary policy on domestic financial stability.[10] Meanwhile, the experience with the taper tantrum in 2013 showed how differences in policy frameworks shaped how severely different economies were affected by financial spillovers.[11]  Still, even with an improved first line of defence, the question how central banks should incorporate financial stability in their reaction functions would remain relevant.[12] One prominent view in the debate surrounding this issue is that, since price stability typically focuses on a shorter time horizon than is appropriate for interpreting financial cycles, there is an inherent conflict between those different objectives. Only by opting for a “financial stability-oriented monetary policy”, the thinking goes, can such tensions be resolved – which would, in turn, support the achievement of both goals over a longer-term horizon.[13]  I would agree that such conflicts between objectives are possible. As an example, consider a “rigid” inflation-targeting central bank that interprets any deviation from its price stability target as an immediate call to action, independently of the nature and persistence of the underlying shock. And suppose this central bank is faced with a sequence of positive cost-push shocks that curb domestic price pressures for a prolonged period of time – for instance due to the gradual penetration of new technologies that boost productivity, or the emergence of new and cheaper sources of global production. The accelerating diffusion of the internet and related digital technologies in recent decades may provide an example of the former, while the emergence of China as a global manufacturing hub exemplifies the latter.[14]  If the central bank is too narrowly focused on achieving a specific inflation target over a specific period of time, it will aim to reinvigorate price dynamics by running a looser monetary policy than would otherwise have been the case. But with that response, it may reinforce the exuberance that is already mushrooming with rising economic optimism. In these conditions, an overly loose monetary policy would fuel the financial cycle, which in turn may encourage a build-up of imbalances in the financial industry characterised by excessive dependence on unstable short-term funding, high levels of leverage, weak underwriting standards, and poor risk measurement and risk management.[15]  This is more than just a hypothetical scenario: empirical evidence suggests that it has been the rule – rather than an exception – for stock market booms to coincide with atypically low inflation. The run-up to the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s, which dovetailed with the positive cost-push shocks described above, provides one particularly vivid example of this pattern.[16] In such cases, a misguided monetary policy reaction amplifies the impact of the initial supply shock and turns it into a demand shock with long run implications for price stability when the cycle eventually turns.  The flexibility of existing monetary policy frameworks But these insights do not automatically lead to the conclusion that central banks must adjust their monetary policy frameworks.  This is because the representation of monetary policy as focusing on a short policy horizon and with little regard for broader financial cycles does not do justice to the strategies that many central banks follow today, and certainly not to the strategy of the ECB. In fact, our monetary policy framework is more flexible than the aforementioned scenario of a rigid inflation-targeter suggests. Our strategy includes important safeguards to prevent an overly narrow and zealous interpretation of price stability from becoming a source of financial instability. Indeed, it incorporated a “leaning-against-the-wind” approach even when the academic consensus pointed in a different direction.[17]  There are two elements to our monetary policy strategy that institutionalise this approach. The first is the flexible and shock-dependent medium-term horizon, which ensures that supply shocks do not automatically elicit a monetary policy response unless there is a danger that they become embedded in inflation expectations. The second is the monetary pillar, which alerts the Governing Council when trends in credit markets may presage emerging risks to financial stability – even when inflation is quiescent.[18]  Together, these elements coalesce into a leaning-against-the-wind orientation which helps us evaluate the impact of economic shocks over sufficiently long horizons and account for their implications for lower-frequency asset price cycles. Monetary analysis, in turn, informs us about the funding patterns that underlie these asset price cycles and alerts us, for instance, to situations in which a generalised upswing in asset prices is fuelled by excess creation of liquidity and over-extension of credit. Detecting and understanding this link helps the ECB form an opinion on whether observed financial market developments are morphing into an unsustainable bubble.[19]  As a consequence, if price and volume indicators of prevailing financing conditions were inappropriate to guarantee sustained macroeconomic and price stability, the ECB would change its policy stance whether or not current or projected inflation already signalled those risks.  This approach guided our monetary policy already prior to the crisis. In fact, buoyant money and credit growth were key factors that motivated the policy tightening cycle that began in 2005. Today our leaning-against-the-wind orientation clearly backs our prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance. The liquidity and demand support provided by monetary policy has countered the downturn and aided the reversal of the financial cycle, thus preventing it from morphing into a chronic credit crunch with persistent dangers for price stability.  Taken together, the ECB’s two pillar strategy thus features key elements that facilitate a leaning-against-the-wind approach.  Challenges and lessons from the crisis Nonetheless, the global financial crisis – which has hit also the euro area with full force and was followed by an exceptionally prolonged economic slump – illustrates that this approach was not sufficient to pre-empt major imbalances. Accordingly, we need to ask ourselves how we can further strengthen the resilience of the macroeconomic policy framework. Also here, the “first line of defence” lies in the broader institutional and legal framework. In fact, the ease with which a central bank can operationalise a leaning-against-the-wind strategy is inevitably affected by the broader policy framework. In a weak macroeconomic framework, the central bank will not just have to “lean against the wind” – it will be forced to “lean against a storm” that will inevitably put strains on – and ultimately overburden – any type of monetary policy strategy. The euro area crisis, characterised by mutually reinforcing vulnerabilities in the sovereign space and the banking system – both of which were precipitated by a weak institutional framework – provides a vivid example of such scenario. By contrast, a more effective first line of defence will support a leaning-against-the-wind approach, both: because other policy domains reinforce the thrust of monetary policy, and because any trade-offs that result are likely to be more favourable. In this context, it may be noted, for instance, that the notion that accommodative monetary policy sustains “zombie banks” is rarely heard in the US context, in view of the stronger institutions for resolving banks and resolving non-performing loans. Overall, we are now seeing progress being made in the euro area and internationally that will improve the first line of defence going forward. The Basel III agenda has tackled several of the weaknesses of pre-crisis banking landscape, while countries have made important strides in terms of operationalising new macro-prudential instruments. Meanwhile, the euro area has moved ahead in its efforts to establish a banking union and the tools available to policymakers to clean up after crises are being progressively strengthened, although difficulties persist in reducing legacy non-performing loans on bank balance sheets. There is thus still work to be done, but the institutional environment has become more conducive to a leaning-against-the-win strategy than before the crisis. The early indications already suggest it has increased the resilience of the financial sector to shocks.  Despite this improved first line of defence, implementing a leaning-against-the-wind approach will remain challenging though. It will require us to identify and model latent financial stability risks, as well as the potential future cost of letting such risks fester at a systemic level. As noted in the past, this task was hampered by crucial knowledge gaps as the common macroeconometric frameworks were not well designed to capture the interactions between financial and real variables.[20] These knowledge gaps, in turn, led the economics profession to underestimate the potential cost that systemic financial crises may impose on broader macroeconomic prospects. Also on this front, we have seen some progress in economic research, especially in integrating real-financial feedback loops into the standard toolkit for macroeconomic analysis, which has enhanced the operational feasibility of leaning-against-the-wind. This toolkit may help distinguish more clearly between benign and malign episodes of financial exuberance and divine better the appropriate monetary policy response. At the same time, the experience of the financial crisis and ensuing recession has shown that the costs generated by malign episodes are more substantial than we thought.  Our challenge going forward is therefore, in my view, to build on our improved monetary policy and regulatory frameworks and focus on their steadfast implementation, rather than to establish a lasting trade-off between financial stability and price stability in central banks’ objective functions.  Such a trade-off would not solve the implementation challenges of leaning-against-the-wind, while it may rekindle the deeper policy challenges that central banks encountered in the past when they sacrificed price stability for other policy concerns. Indeed, the lesson from the 1970s is that, if a central bank downgrades its inflation mandate to a point where inflation expectations become seriously de-anchored, sooner or later it will be called upon to assume full responsibility for bringing inflation back under control. At that point, inflation stabilisation and a re-anchoring of expectations may have to come at a very high cost in terms of output losses and financial stability risks.   Conclusion Let me summarise.  Monetary policy has a powerful impact on the incentive structure of market participants and, via this channel, on the cycle in asset prices and monetary aggregates. Since this cycle is propagated via global financial markets, domestic monetary policy inevitably entails international spillovers. Monetary policy geared towards domestic price stability generally supports financial stability. In the current situation, for instance, the ECB’s continued monetary accommodation not only supports a return of inflation to levels closer to 2% but also aids balance sheet repair in the euro area and mitigates the risk of adverse spillovers to the financial systems in other economies. An overly rigid interpretation of the price stability objective, however, may at times give rise to conflicts between price stability and financial stability. And a failure of major central banks to appropriately account for this risk in their monetary policy strategies can create new, or reinforce existing, financial vulnerabilities at global level. Against this background, the ECB follows a flexible medium-term horizon and, as part of its two-pillar strategy, closely monitors the dynamics in money and credit which may act as signals for the build-up of financial imbalances. But in confronting such imbalances, other policy domains – including on the macroprudential and regulatory side – have to play their part to ensure stability in a context of sound macroeconomic performance.

I will admittedly be asking more questions than giving answers. I won’t be giving any definitive guide to the future shape of the ECB’s monetary policy framework. What I will offer is my view on some of the key issues on this topic and pose some questions of relevance to policymakers.  Monetary policy operational frameworks concern the intermediate targets of central banks and how they meet them. This is distinct from monetary policy strategies, which concern the quantitative definition of policy objectives, the horizon over which they should be delivered as well as the organisation and weighting of incoming information.  Operational frameworks can be designed along two main dimensions: (i) the operational target for monetary policy; and (ii) the measures used for implementing that target, which include the mode of liquidity provision or absorption, the counterparties that are eligible to take part in those operations and facilities, and the choice of collateral which is accepted in reverse repo operations. Where central banks position themselves along these dimensions is clearly path-dependent but it depends, among other things, on institutions and financial structures. A comparison between the pre-crisis frameworks of the Federal Reserve and the ECB illustrates the different possible constellations.  While both central banks had similar operational targets – de facto one or more very short-term interest rates – the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet consisted mainly of outright holdings of US government bonds, considered as a safe asset. The Fed also steered liquidity conditions, at the margin, via repos, whereby the collateral set was narrow and again dominated by that safe asset. By contrast, the ECB, lacking a single fiscal counterpart and operating across multiple jurisdictions, injected liquidity mainly through repos with banks and deployed a wider collateral and counterparty framework (albeit with appropriate credit safeguards). Credit was provided to around 1,800 counterparties, against a set of collateral that comprised many different asset classes.  The ECB’s operational framework proved flexible when the crisis hit, helping cushion the initial financial turbulence. And as the crisis unfolded in successive \"waves\" and materially altered our market environment, we adopted further measures to meet the new challenges we faced. We are thus now presented with an important question– should we treat these changes as temporary imperatives that should be withdrawn as soon as conditions permit, or should they form a permanent part of our operational framework? To answer this, we need to ask: of all the challenges we have faced during the crisis, which ones are likely to persist? And which measures should we retain to deal with them? In my view, there are two challenges that stand out. The first is how monetary policy should adapt to structural shifts in financial intermediation. The second is how to cope with the constraints imposed on central banks by the effective lower bound of interest rates.   Shifts in financial intermediation Financial intermediation in recent years has been characterised by two structural shifts, one of which was specific to the euro area and one of which is global.  In the euro area, financial markets underwent severe spatial fragmentation in the early phase of the crisis, with intermediation retreating behind national borders and impairing the bank lending channel of monetary policy. Many of the changes to our operational framework during the crisis were a reaction to this. For example, the move towards fixed-rate full allotment liquidity provision, the widening of our collateral framework and the extension of the maturity of our lending operations acted as crucial stabilisers and averted sudden stops in market funding for national banking systems. While this problem has now largely disappeared, it would be complacent to see it as completely resolved. Some key components of our banking union (such as the build-up of the Single Resolution Fund and the removal of national options and discretions in bank supervision) are still being phased in, and some key drivers of fragmentation, such as the bank-sovereign nexus, remain unsolved – not to mention a lingering risk of political fragmentation.  The second structural shift in patterns of intermediation, a global one, is linked to financial regulation. Tighter financial regulation is both increasingly affecting the behaviour of supervised entities, and encouraging a parallel shift towards unregulated forms of finance. This dual process has repercussions for monetary policy implementation. It increases demand for safe short-term instruments to meet new regulatory requirements, such as the liquidity coverage ratio and margin requirements for derivatives. And it fosters the use of prime collateral for lenders in unregulated forms of finance as a form of self-protection. This is not necessarily undesirable: a higher share of non-bank financing is intended in the EU as part of the capital markets union project and will make our financial system more resilient to shocks originating in the banking system. But these shifts raise important questions for central banks’ operational frameworks. In my view the tail risk of spatial fragmentation is an argument for retaining certain elements of our crisis framework, in particular our “wider” collateral policy.  The same could be said for the fixed-rate full allotment mode of liquidity provision. In the new regulatory environment there may be a need to accommodate a structural excess demand for liquid and safe financial claims. This may call for a framework where the central bank can separate the level of reserves from the level of policy rates on a permanent basis. Fixed-rate full allotment would support such a disentangling of interest rates from liquidity conditions.  Another question is how to adjust our framework in response to the growth of non-bank finance in Europe. A more market-based financial structure may make it easier for us to provide liquidity via outright purchases, which may in turn become more important as a regular instrument of policy if we operate in a framework of excess reserves. In that environment, the quantity of liquidity to be supplied could become a quasi-intermediate target almost on a par with the level of the policy rate. But then we could not rely solely on “passive” lending operations to deliver the right stance of policy: we would need a more active instrument to inject the “right” quantity of reserves.  But all this could have drawbacks as well. First, the monitoring costs and complexity of a wide-collateral and counterparty framework are higher. Second, a framework based on fixed-rate full allotment would to some extent weaken signals of liquidity and credit risk in the money market. Third, and most importantly, the responsibility for generating safe assets should not only fall on central banks, but on fiscal issuers – not necessarily by issuing more bonds, which may make them less safe, but by improving the credibility of their fiscal frameworks. In the euro area, common debt issuance could one day support this objective, if done in a way which does not undermine incentives for sound fiscal management.  The effective lower bound on interest rates Moving to the second challenge – the effective lower bound – recent evidence suggests that real neutral rates have fallen to very low levels, driven by both cyclical and structural forces.[1] This challenge is common to advanced economies but it is more pronounced in the euro area than in the US, given its markedly lower rate of potential output growth. In this context, all major central banks reduced interest rates to very low levels, thereby approaching the effective lower bound on interest rates. They responded to this via different measures: providing forward guidance, launching large-scale purchases of public and private sector assets, and – in our case – by implementing a negative interest rate policy, which has in fact uncovered that the effective lower bound is lower than was previously thought.  These measures have been very effective in supporting output and inflation and anchoring medium-term price stability. However, they were taken on the implicit assumption that they would be transient, both because monetary stimulus would help counter the cyclical forces depressing the real equilibrium rate and because other economic policies would provide cyclical support and tackle the more structural drivers of low real rates. But if other economic policies do not in fact play this role, then we cannot exclude that the real equilibrium rate remains low. As such, we may see short-term rates being pushed to the effective lower bound more frequently in the event of macroeconomic shocks; and the stimulus provided by lowering interest rates to that level would be of course be much weaker.  For central banks to retain a handle on output and inflation, then, unconventional policies may have to be deployed more frequently. But this would come with at least three complications. First is the question of the operational target. A target focused on short-term interest rates makes sense when this is the main policy variable, but if short-term rates are persistently pushed towards the lower bound, monetary policy has to focus on a wider constellation of rates across different maturities and asset classes. What then is its target? Central bankers currently offer quantity targets in these cases – a volume of assets to be bought per month – but price targets are only given in general terms, for instance “flattening the yield curve”. This is appropriate so long as balance sheet policies are temporary. It may not be in the long term, but moving to price targets may come at the expense of price discovery.  This links to the second complication: balance sheet policies can mitigate certain facets of the safe asset shortage, but they might exacerbate others. In particular, balance sheet policies have been stimulative by swapping central bank money for assets with duration and credit risk. But over time, if monetary policy continues to withdraw long-dated safe collateral from the market, there is a risk that it has a countervailing effect – i.e. that it exacerbates safe asset hoarding at the long end of the yield curve. As various academics have documented[2], this could eventually put further downward pressure on real equilibrium rates.  Central banks have responded to this by re-lending their portfolios of securities. But this is only a temporary fix. The first best solution would clearly be for fiscal issuers to generate more safe assets under the conditions outlined above. If this does not happen, central banks may have to use their own balance sheets to satisfy safe asset demand, also at longer maturities. A third complication is that extended use of unconventional measures could come with rising side effects, for instance on financial stability, financial intermediation and international spillovers. Thus far, the benefits of such measures have clearly outweighed their costs, but we cannot rule out a situation where the side effects are such that the negative consequences prevail. When discussing negative interest rates, I have called that tipping point the “economic” lower bound, in contrast to the “physical” lower bound, where large-scale substitution with cash materialises, a point which has clearly not been reached.[3]  This could mean a more frequent use of micro- and macroprudential measures to oppose the adverse financial stability effects of very low rates, also in countries affected by international spillovers. It could further accelerate shifts towards non-bank forms of intermediation with the consequences I described above. And it may mean moving towards a regime of greater international cooperation and policy alignment to avoid a situation where the effective lower bound leads to competitive devaluations.  Conclusion  Let me conclude.  Today, we face an exceptional situation where the real equilibrium rate is very low. All the monetary policy measures we have taken were a necessary response to this. They stabilised the euro area economy and anchored medium-term price stability. But they were done on the assumption that low real rates would be temporary, because other policies would act in their fields of responsibility.  The ECB’s operational framework and its monetary policy strategy are robust and sufficiently flexible to deal with the current challenges. We will fulfil the price stability mandate given to us by the Treaty. But if other actors do not take the necessary measures in their policy domains, we may need to dive deeper into our operational framework and strategy to do so.

The decline in interest rates – both nominal and real – has been a persistent trend since the 1990s and is visible in the long-term interest rates on government bonds [Slide 2: 10 year government bond yields]. A range of structural factors have been proposed for this secular decline in the rate of return on safe assets, including demographic changes, a slowdown in the rate of technological progress, and a high demand for safe assets relative to their supply.[2]  This decline in long-run interest rates has consequences for monetary policy. Monetary policymakers often think in terms of a concept known as the real equilibrium rate or the “natural” rate of interest.[3] This equilibrium rate is the interest rate that is consistent with stable inflation and output at its potential level. Setting short-term interest rates above this rate puts downward pressure on activity and inflation. Setting them below this rate of course has the opposite effect. While this real equilibrium interest rate is difficult to estimate precisely, and while there are competing explanations for it, there is a broad consensus that it has declined in advanced economies over the past two decades. By some estimates it is currently negative in the euro area.[4]  Since the global financial crisis, inflation has been low worldwide, and growth subdued. Central bankers are responding to this low inflation and output below potential by conducting accommodative policies. Both these cyclical factors and the longer-term decline in the equilibrium real rate of interest have required policy rates to be set at record low levels in advanced economies [Slide 3: Policy rates in major economies]. As short-term policy rates approached zero, central banks carried out further loosening by providing forward guidance about the expected future path of interest rates and by lowering term premia through large-scale asset purchase programmes.  In June 2014, following in the footsteps of the Danish National Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) became the first major central bank to lower one of its key policy rates to negative territory. The rate of interest on our deposit facility is now -0.4% while the rate on our main refinancing operations is zero.[5] At the same time, we launched an asset purchase programme (APP) covering a broad range of investment grade securities. These various policy measures are complementary instruments and are necessary to ensure that sufficient stimulus is provided to the economy to return inflation to the ECB’s objective. Failure to take into account the downward trend in real equilibrium interest rates would have resulted in downward pressure on inflation and activity, pushing real interest rates up and driving the economy further away from full employment. It is difficult to know how long these low interest rates will persist, but it seems possible that they will be low for quite some time. That certainly is the view of financial markets, where the return on government bonds is negative for a range of countries, even at long maturities. [Slide 4: Government bonds with negative yields]   While low or negative rates and the asset purchase programmes are needed to provide sufficient monetary stimulus, a number of observers have voiced concern about their impact on the behaviour of economic agents, on the resilience of financial intermediaries and, ultimately, on financial stability.[6]  Today, I will offer some thoughts on these issues, focusing on the banking sector, which plays a key role in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.   The specialness of negative nominal interest rates  So what makes negative rates special? [Slide 5: The specialness of negative nominal interest rates] The first answer is cash. Since cash (i.e. paper money and coins) offers a zero nominal return, at some point it will dominate holding assets with negative nominal yields.[7] For example, if banks were to charge significantly negative rates on deposits, then the higher return on cash could lead households and businesses to withdraw their deposits. And this disintermediation would be likely to pose risks to financial stability. Of course, holding cash is not entirely convenient or costless. It would be cumbersome (not to mention risky) to buy a car or a house in cash, and storing a large amount of cash requires high-security storage as well as insurance. These costs of holding and insuring cash explain why the effective lower bound on interest rates is below zero.[8]  The academic discussion of negative rates has centred around cash, but in public debate other issues have recently emerged. One issue is associated with money illusion, i.e. the tendency of people to value assets and goods in nominal rather than in real terms.[9] This led to the notion that negative nominal rates are unnatural, which has become a popular theme in the public debate.[10] In contrast, we have been through episodes of negative real rates in the past without having such debates. Indeed, as the Bundesbank has noted, negative real rates of interest on deposits have been the norm rather than the exception in Germany in recent decades.[11] [Slide 6: Real remuneration of savings deposits in Germany] People may gradually understand the rationale behind negative nominal rates and adapt to this new situation. For instance, the popular assumption that the negative income effect on household consumption dominates the positive substitution effect when nominal yields are very low is not in line with the evidence. In fact, the average net interest income of euro area households has been largely unaffected, thanks to lower interest payments. Low interest rates have mainly redistributed resources from net savers to net borrowers. As the latter typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume than the former, this has further supported consumption.[12] But one cannot rule out that negative nominal interest rates raise broader cognitive issues as they challenge the rules of thumb used by economic agents in their everyday decisions. Finally, negative rates may be special due to institutional features embedded in the financial system, such as legal restrictions on the application of negative rates or at least uncertainty regarding the legal standing of such an arrangement,[13] or the tax treatment of negative interest rate income, which is often not symmetric with the treatment of positive interest rate income. In addition, some IT systems may not be able to cope with negative rates.  In the euro area, however, these scenarios have not yet materialised. Thanks to intensive technical cooperation between the ECB and market participants ahead of the introduction of negative rates, our experience has been very smooth, allowing large parts of the government bond and secured and unsecured money markets to operate at negative rates without any disruption.[14] The introduction of negative rates has been smooth also in other jurisdictions outside of the euro area.[15]   How low and for how long? There are two key questions for central bankers [Slide 7: How much lower can we go?]. First, how much lower can we go? Second, does the persistence of low and/or negative interest rates pose particular challenges to the stability of the financial system?  Answering the first question appears to be simple. As I said earlier, the “physical lower bound” of nominal interest rates, at which disintermediation risk will materialise, is imposed by the opportunity cost of holding cash.  But is there an “economic lower bound”, different from the physical one, where further rate cuts cease to provide aggregate stimulus to the economy? This economic lower bound could then potentially but not necessarily impose an earlier binding constraint for monetary policy. Indeed, in the current discussion, it has been suggested that at some point the level of rates can become low to the extent that the detrimental effects on the banking sector outweigh the benefits of lower rates. In a recent paper, Brunnermeier and Koby refer to this rate as the “reversal rate”.[16] At the reversal rate, bank profitability will fall, reducing capital generation via retained earnings, which is an important source of capital accumulation, and thereby eventually restricting lending. The risk that low rates might cause short-term dislocation in financial markets was already identified by Bernanke and Reinhart in their 2004 paper on the implications of very low rates.[17]  Low (and negative rates) have both a one-off short-term impact and more persistent effects on a bank’s profitability and capital. And bank capital matters for credit provision and for financial stability, as low bank capital means high leverage. The short-term impact partly stems from one-off capital gains on the outstanding fixed-income portfolio of a bank. When rates are falling, the value of fixed-income securities on a bank’s balance sheet goes up, leading to higher profits. A decline in the level of interest rates can also boost net interest margins in the short run. Banks carry out maturity transformation by borrowing short term and lending long term. As short-term interest rates fall, funds become cheaper. Since existing fixed-rate loans take some time to reprice to lower rates, the initial impact of lower rates on net interest margins could be positive.  Other things being equal, lower rates will decrease net interest income over the long term. If the decline in rates is accompanied by a flattening of the yield curve, the margin between lending and borrowing eventually compresses, reducing net interest income. Such a flattening may result from expectations of a prolonged period of low short-term rates, and it may be compounded by a compression of the term premium if the central bank also operates a large-scale asset purchase programme.  Even for a given slope of the yield curve, a low level of interest rates can also compress net interest margins for banks reliant on retail deposits. The reason is that retail deposits tend to have low and sticky interest rates, and banks are reluctant to charge negative rates on them. As market rates decline, the yield on bank assets will eventually drop, but this funding source will still cost the same to banks, resulting in a decline in net interest margins. The decline in present and future net interest margin reduces the forward-looking measure of bank capital, hence the risk-bearing capacity of the bank, and its supply of credit. This is turning upside down Adrian and Shin’s “credit supply channel” of transmission of monetary policy.[18]  The exact magnitude of the effect of negative interest rates on aggregate bank profitability is uncertain, since it has to be put in the context of what would happen in the absence of monetary policy action. First of all, servicing floating-rate loans and mortgages becomes more affordable as interest rates fall. Borrowers who are struggling in the adverse economic climate are therefore less likely to default. Second, and more importantly, accommodative monetary policy should create a more favourable macroeconomic environment, which ought to improve the financial situation of bank borrowers. Indeed, empirical research shows a clear negative relation between economic growth rates and non-performing loans.[19] These positive effects are present at all rate levels and are likely to dominate when rates are moderately negative. Also, the economic lower bound is not uniquely determined at the aggregate level, since it will vary across banks and markets. The larger the share of floating-rate lending in the stock of loans, the faster the negative impact on interest margins will be. Banks with large fixed-income holdings and holdings of bonds which benefited the most from spread compression will be better able to offset decreases in interest margins, due to the revaluation effect I mentioned earlier. The reversal rate is also likely to be lower for those banks that are more reliant on wholesale rather than retail funding. Market-based funding suffers less from this zero lower bound, meaning that these banks will be better able to protect their interest margin. Similarly, banks with greater market power will be better able to avoid passing on the lower rates to borrowers, which will shield their interest margin. In the euro area, this translates into geographic differences based on national banking structures, implying that the negative interest rate policy has distributional consequences across banks located in different jurisdictions.  The second important question for central bankers is whether the persistence of low and/or negative interest rates poses other challenges to the stability of the financial system. Challenges to financial stability could potentially materialise if banks were to increase their exposure to lower quality counterparties in order to boost returns.[20] This could reflect a portfolio rebalancing towards riskier assets when yields on safe assets are low, or a greater concentration of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which generate higher returns but have historically exhibited higher default risk.  The effect is similar to the “search for yield” by managers targeting a minimum return on assets.[21] Note that this mechanism may as well apply to shadow banks insofar as they rely on short-term funding. Financial stability risks could also materialise outside of banks, through excessively inflated financial asset prices and if zero or negative rates encourage asset price volatility.  Existing empirical evidence, mainly relying on periods with low, but positive rates before the global financial crisis, indicates that periods of lower interest rates are indeed associated with lower bank lending standards and with a shift of credit towards borrowers with a lower credit quality.[22] Additionally, the latest ECB Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the Euro Area (SAFE) shows an improvement in the availability of bank loans for SMEs between October 2014 (shortly after negative rates were introduced) and March 2016.[23] This could indicate that one way that banks are taking on more risk is by lending more to smaller, and typically riskier, firms.  Of course, promoting lending, including to risky borrowers, is one of the goals of accommodative monetary policy.  But the main question, however, is whether negative rates can also lead to excessive risk-taking by banks. If accommodative monetary policy works as intended, then more investment projects will gain a positive net present value and will be financed – including some riskier ones. That’s the “good” risk-taking. However, banks may be tempted to finance risky but negative net present value loans – that is excessive or “bad” risk-taking. The theory suggests that this possibility is more likely when interest rates are low, if banks are highly leveraged or if they can easily adjust their capital structure.[24]   Empirical evidence While theoretically appealing, a precise estimate of the point where accommodative monetary policy becomes contractionary and/or an issue for financial stability is extremely challenging.  What I can offer you today is an overview of the situation of financial intermediaries in the euro area, in order to see whether there are signs that we have reached or are reaching a reversal rate.  But let me start by referring to the most recent data on monetary developments in the euro area. They show no signs of cash substitution, indicating that we are still far from the physical lower bound for nominal interest rates.[25]  In a second step, let me focus on bank income and profitability. Slide 8 shows the main sources of operating income for banks in the euro area, based on aggregate numbers. [ Slide 8: Euro-area banks: Income sources ] In recent years, the distribution of these sources has been fairly stable, with approximately 60% of income coming from net interest income, 25% from fees and commissions and 15% from other income sources. Given its large share, net interest income thus plays an important role in bank profitability. As I mentioned, a reduction in interest rates could harm interest margins, and this could be even more pronounced when rates enter negative territory, due to a potential zero lower bound for retail deposit rates.  Slide 9 illustrates average loan and deposit rates for both non-financial corporations and households in the euro area.[26] [ Slide 9: Euro-area banks: Interest rates on new loans and deposits ] The vertical red line indicates June 2014, the first time deposit facility rates became negative in the euro area. The gap between loan rates and deposit rates narrows because declining rates are passed on more strongly to loan rates than to deposit rates, indicating that there indeed seems to be a zero lower bound for deposits. While average deposit rates only decreased by around 0.2 percentage point between June 2014 and May 2016, loan rates decreased by around 0.8 percentage point, effectively reducing the interest margin. This is also shown on slide 10, using profit and loss data of a group of large euro area banks, which on average indeed have seen a reduction of their net interest margins – defined here as net interest income over total assets – since mid-2014. [ Slide 10: Euro-area large banks: Net interest margin ]   But what about overall income? ECB staff estimates show that the overall impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario without any monetary policy action[27]  [Slide 11: Monetary policy and bank profitability: estimates]. Decreasing net interest income and charges on excess liquidity do put pressure on bank profitability. But there are also two strong positive effects of lower rates. First, the positive impact of lower rates on the macro environment reduces firm default risk and lowers the debt servicing cost of borrowers, which should improve credit quality. Second, lower rates will lead to capital gains on the bond portfolio of banks.  The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review[28] broadly confirms these model-based estimates. As slide 12 shows, the net income of euro area significant banking groups actually increased between 2014 and 2015 [Slide 12: Euro-area large banks: Aggregate net income]. This was mainly driven by lower impairments and higher non-interest income. Even net interest income made a positive contribution, despite a small decline in interest margins. This reflects an increase in volumes, which is of course an intended consequence of accommodative monetary policy. As discussed earlier, however, interest margins are likely to stay low and might even further decline, while profits from one-off capital gains will fade away. Indeed, analysts forecast a decline in bank profitability in 2016 and 2017, mainly due to lower net interest income. And the recent decline in euro area bank share prices can be at least partially ascribed to market concerns over future banks profitability. As such, if very low or negative rates are here for a prolonged period of time due to the structural drivers highlighted above, banks might have to rethink their business models. The revenue structure of euro area banks was stable for a long time but it has recently begun to change and there is at least some evidence of banks tending to offer fee-based products to clients as substitutes for interest-based products.[29] Another way forward is to improve cost efficiency. Although a number of banks have reduced their operating costs over the last couple of years, overall cost efficiency has remained low in the euro area, with aggregate cost-income ratios between 63% and 65% over the last five years.[30] Action taken by euro-area banks to remedy this situation will also help them cope with a prolonged period of very low rates. Action to dispose of their stocks of legacy non-performing loans, which has been identified by ECB Banking Supervision as one of its priorities for 2016, will also safeguard their profitability. Moving away from profitability, deposit growth rates for euro area banks show that there is no sign of disintermediation risk at the moment. Deposits of both households and non-financial corporations have been growing over the past two years, at a similar pace to the period before we entered negative interest rate territory [ Slide 13: Euro-area banks: Deposit growth ]. This risk is not materialising mainly because rates on retail deposit seem to have a zero lower bound, as shown earlier.  With regard to bank lending, it is clear that we have not yet reached the reversal rate for the euro area. Bank lending has improved since mid-2014, both for non-financial corporations and households. [ Slide 14: Euro-area banks: Loan growth ] Similarly, results from the ECB’s July 2016 euro area bank lending survey clearly indicate that loan supply conditions for enterprises in the area are continuing to improve.  Finally, what about the risks to financial stability? The ongoing economic recovery should help bolster the income and earnings position of euro area households and non-financial corporations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with a continued debt overhang which persists in some countries. At the same time, the recovery of euro area real estate markets has gained further momentum. While overall residential property valuations remain contained, prime commercial property valuations have moved above long-term averages. Against this backdrop, as highlighted in the ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, the best way to counter any potentially emerging risk in any market segment is targeted action by the macroprudential authorities.  Conclusions  Let me conclude. As is well known from the academic literature, the “physical lower bound” of short-term nominal interest rates is equal to the opportunity costs of holding cash. Monetary developments in the euro area show no signs of cash substitution, indicating that we are still far away from the physical lower bound. Central bankers should however be mindful of a potential “economic lower bound”, at which the detrimental effects of low rates on the banking sector outweigh their benefits, and further rate cuts risk reversing the expansionary monetary policy stance.  The ECB is mindful of these risks. In the euro area, the potential adverse impact on bank profitability, if it materialises, would be compounded by low growth prospects and a legacy of high non-performing loans.[31] The current conditions of financial intermediation suggest, however, that the economic lower bound is safely below the current level of the deposit facility rate and that the impact of negative rates, combined with the APP and forward guidance, has clearly been net positive. Indeed, we should not look at the implications of negative interest rates in isolation. Negative nominal rates have reinforced forward guidance in the euro area, sped up the process of portfolio rebalancing associated with the APP and supported the effectiveness of the recent targeted longer-term refinancing operations. But there can be cumulative effects on financial intermediation and financial stability if rates remain very low for a very long time. One might argue that disintermediation may have benign effects if non-bank entities are equally capable of collecting and channelling savings, while being less vulnerable to the adverse effects of negative interest rates. The shift towards a more market-based financial structure, as promoted by the European Union’s capital markets union project, would then help our economy cope with a longer period of very low or negative rates. But there is a limit to this argument. Non-banks are also affected by very low rates: for example, fixed net asset value money market funds may not be able to maintain the value of their shares close to par, while asset managers and insurance companies face the same shrinking margins as banks. Regardless of the entities that originate and distribute, household savings will be collected and long-term assets will sit on a balance sheet. So what can be done to address this situation? The ECB’s monetary policy measures, including the deposit facility rate set at its current negative level, are proving to be effective in lifting inflation towards its medium-term objective and reducing the overall level of risk in the economy. Fiscal and structural policies should act more decisively to support aggregate demand and productivity, thereby preventing the economy from falling into a low interest rate trap. And banks should adapt continually to the changing environment by adjusting their business models, cutting their operating costs and reducing their non-performing loans. In doing so, they will also improve their resilience to a prolonged period of very low rates.

Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank the organisers for inviting me again to this important event in Madrid, where I last spoke two years ago, also in the context of the Master in Banking and Financial Regulation of the University of Navarra.[1]  The future of banking is certainly a very topical subject, particularly after the global financial crisis. The 2007-08 episode clearly demonstrated that financial crises, particularly when they involve the banking sector, can be enormously expensive both in terms of direct fiscal costs and associated costs for the real economy. Over the period 2008-14 accumulated gross financial sector assistance by euro area governments amounted to 8% of euro area GDP, of which, so far, around 3% has been recovered.[2] Moreover, the crisis induced the Great Recession and the costs of foregone output have been severe. At the aggregate level, the euro area output is now 20% below the level it would have achieved had the trend growth in the previous 15 years continued after 2007. Considering that the economy would grow from now on at that same trend, the accumulated loss of output until 2030, properly discounted, would represent more than three times the whole output of 2008. The crisis left a permanent economic loss with broad scars in our societies. In light of these consequences, regulators embarked on an ambitious international regulatory reform programme after the crisis, which has mostly concentrated on making the banking system safer and more resilient. In this respect, significant progress has been made: in the euro area, banks have materially bolstered their capital positions, with the average common equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions rising to 13% by end-2015 from around 9% in 2012 and 7% in 2008. To a large extent, challenges and transformations in the banking sector are of a global dimension, even if I will mostly illustrate it with European data. The crisis was however not the sole product of banks’ behaviour but also of the shadow banking sector that expanded rapidly in the run-up to the crisis, forming a new market-based credit system. There are unfortunately different concepts of shadow banking that add to confusion. One version relates to all credit intermediation done by non-banks; another, more relevant approach is not based on entities but encompasses all activities of the new market-based credit system. This comprises a vast array of financial services, in which banks are also involved, resulting from the expansion of securitisation; of securities financing transactions (SFTs), i.e. securities lending and repurchase agreements (repos); of collateral management and intermediation; and finally, of risk transformation via transactions using derivative swaps , from credit default swaps to interest rate or forex swaps. Several of these activities can be conducted by regulated banks or by less regulated institutions.  These activities became of extreme importance for two reasons.[3] First, they contributed to the creation of a market-based lending system backed by secured short-term market funding. This is the proper concept of shadow banking or what is also called the new market-based credit system. Second, these activities originated types of liquidity instruments which are forms of money not usually counted in the regular monetary aggregates. Several authors[4],\\xa0 [5] designate this type of activity as shadow banking. Those features, especially the expansion of credit assets funded with short term securities (e.g. repos or ABCP) led to a significant increase in the leverage of the entire finance activity and created chains of inside liquidity, including by means of re-use of “repo-ed” securities, phenomena which were at the centre of the financial crisis. The markets for these non-deposit short term financial liabilities became very large and were crucial for the excessive leverage and the illusion of abundant liquidity that led to the crisis. The origins of this new credit system are related to the emergence of very sizeable cash pools looking for safer places to keep that cash in the short-term than in the form of banks’ uninsured deposits.[6] Secured collateral lending and repos as well as risk transformation via swap derivatives (credit, interest rates and forex) were developed for that purpose. Securities lending for shorting and generating collateralised levered transactions for asset managers were also part of the new system. The activities of re-hypothecation and re-use of securities in the repo market amplified the creation of chains of inside liquidity and high leverage with negative consequences when haircuts increased and the repo market turned illiquid as the crisis unfolded.  The international financial regulatory reform has primarily focused on the banking system. It has not yet dealt with these new activities in an appropriate way.[7] One could even say it has aggravated what Charles Goodhart called the “boundary problem”[8], referring to the gap created between the more regulated part of the system, arguably the banks, and other less regulated financial institutions. As he argues “If regulation is effective it will constrain the regulated from achieving their preferred, unrestricted position, often by lowering their profitability.”  A crucial rationale for bank regulation relates to the fact that when they concede credit, banks create money by creating a corresponding deposit. This activity that is at the centre or our credit-money system, involves a significant liquidity transformation as deposits are much more liquid than credits. In a recent book, Mervyn King called this property the “alchemy of banking”[9] and many reforms have been proposed to overcome the fragilities created by banking as we know it. I will examine some of them later.  While not taking in deposits, non-bank entities forming the new financial sector should also be subject to some new regulations. There is a need to address vulnerabilities created by the expansion of leveraged assets funded by short-term liabilities that play the same role as money.  Chart 1 illustrates how banks have been decreasing their importance in the whole financial system in benefit of other institutions forming the new market-based credit system. In 2008, total assets of banks in the euro area stood at EUR 33 trillion and declined to EUR 28 trillion at the end of last year. Meanwhile, assets of Money Market Funds and all other types of Investment Funds have increased from EUR 5.6 trillion to 11.4 trillion in 2015, moving from 17% to 40% of total bank assets.    The expanded role of capital markets and the market-based credit system with the resulting shrinkage of the banking sector are not per se negative developments. Diversification and competition contribute to enhance efficiency and to lower transaction costs in the financing of the economy. Banks too have welcomed the embryonic initiatives of the EU Commission to develop a capital markets union in the future. As mentioned previously, banks also participate in the new forms of financing and the bigger ones are crucially involved in all the activities linked to capital markets, from the issuance to the distribution of securities and trading. On the other hand, existing Investment Funds are often part of banking groups. However, despite adjustments in business models, more traditional banks face accrued challenges.  Today, I will argue that banks are under siege but a successful adaptation to the challenges they face is key to revive their prospects and their effective contribution to credit intermediation. After all, one cannot ignore the importance of a stable, profitable and competitive banking sector for sustainable economic growth, even if it is bound to shrink. In this lecture, I will first dwell upon the main challenges that banking activity faces in the world at large. I will then discuss some proposals that aim at a deep reform of the financial system, in view of the future role of banking. Finally I will focus on the specific challenges confronting the euro area banking sector, from low profitability to excessive NPLs, overbanking and new regulations like TLAC and MREL.   2. Banks under siege: general challenges  Beyond increased competition from non-banks, the banking sector faces competition from Financial Technology (FinTech) firms with other challenges relating to the low interest rate environment as well as the regulatory measures still to come.   2.1. FinTech threat of unbundling banks There is a lot of hype around the emergence of new specialised start-up financial firms that take advantage of digitalisation and big data techniques aimed at unbundling the activities of banks. This is not foreseeable despite the current excitement. This is because banks will also adopt the new technologies and will defend their franchise. Furthermore, after crossing some thresholds, the new forms of finance will eventually start to be regulated due to the same market failures and externalities (i.e. asymmetry of information, moral hazard, adverse selection and herd behaviour) that justify regulation in the banking sector.  Having said that, payment services could indeed become a domain where banks may lose significant market share. Other activities at stake comprise: savings and investment management over the internet, with robo-advisors that provide algorithm-based portfolio management services online at a fraction of the costs associated with traditional portfolio managers and investment advisors; crowdfunding or direct equity funding of projects by investors gathered mostly over the internet; peer-to-peer lending (P2P) whereby online services match lenders and borrowers which can be individuals or small businesses; or online money management advice aggregating all bank and savings accounts of the clients.  Hundreds, if not thousands of start-ups can be found in all of these domains. The whole sector is nevertheless still quite small. According to a recent study by McKinsey, USD 23 billion of venture capital and growth equity has been deployed to FinTechs in the five years to 2014, with around one-half of this total invested in 2014.[10] A significant part of this investment was concentrated in the area of payment services, where banks are facing the biggest challenge from these new competitors. It is followed by P2P lending, which is the next most developed activity, funded by hedge funds, institutional investors and sometimes even banks. The first accidents with bad credits started to emerge recently as big data and smart algorithms can also fail. As the sector expands, many more episodes will likely occur. Furthermore, if it starts to cater for regular retail funding it will gradually become regulated as a banking activity.  Nevertheless, intensified competition from FinTech companies represents a potential threat for banks. If they do not respond effectively to this challenge, this could lead to a loss of market share and significant reduction in bank revenue. In five major retail banking-businesses (consumer finance, mortgages, SME lending, retail payments and wealth management), according with McKinsey, 10 to 40% of revenues and between 20 and 60% of profits will be at risk by 2025, with consumer finance identified as the most vulnerable.[11] In the end, new competitors will likely capture only a small portion of these businesses, with banks’ losses most likely coming from margin compression.  The new technology of the distributed ledger or blockchain is of a different nature and represents an opportunity, mostly for banks that have financial capacity to invest in it, and can establish a wide network of secure, less expensive account transactions and settlements. Even that will not dispense with some central official role to ensure final settlement and validate the reputation and qualification of participant institutions in the network. Private money like Bitcoin, behind the blockchain technology, cannot go far due to lack of confidence. Like many commercial banks, central banks are also actively studying possible developments in this area and attentive to their potential role in the future.   2.2. Uncertainty in the finalisation of the regulatory agenda On the regulatory side, many of the measures deriving from the post-crisis agenda are already in place: capital requirements were increased, (fully-loaded Basel III requirements are already met by most banks), a leverage ratio was imposed, new liquidity rules were established.  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which was implemented in the EU in October 2015 aims to ensure that banks have enough liquid assets to meet liquidity needs over the following 30 days. Moreover, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) which will enter into force at a later stage but is already complied with by most euro area banks will require banks to replace short-term with longer term funding, which is generally more costly (because of term premia). The experience of the crisis has however demonstrated that some trade-off in profitability versus resilience is well justified.  Importantly, a few remaining initiatives on the regulatory agenda for banks and the non-bank sector still need to be finalised and implemented. After the revision of capital requirements for the trading book and the final calibration of the Leverage Ratio, capital requirements will still be fine-tuned with a full revision of the Standardised Approach as well as some restrictions on the use of banks’ internal models in the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) have nevertheless communicated that the overall bank capital requirements will not be significantly increased. A Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) is being conducted for the banks to report the consequences of the drafted measures and a final decision will be taken in Autumn, only after these consequences are assessed. The commitment is that there will be no Basel IV and that Basel III will be concluded by year-end thus providing regulatory certainty for the future.  Another ongoing discussion that has added to regulatory uncertainty concerns the treatment of sovereign exposures. This discussion is important and could indeed have a significant impact on the financial sector. Three principles form the ECB’s view on the matter: first, we agree with the rationale to change the present system, where sovereign exposures are treated as a risk-free asset; second, the revision should not create undue turbulence in markets, like the repo market or short-term money markets at large, where sovereign debt is widely used; third, the regulatory change should be at the level of the international standard, i.e., it should come out of the BCBS’ discussion. This latter principle is also in line with the Five Presidents' Report and the BCBS is working on the issue. Also at the international level, an agreement was reached at the end of last year on the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, or TLAC, for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) with a view to overcoming the “too-big–to-fail” issue and making resolution simpler and more predictable. TLAC still needs to be implemented in Europe, where the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) provides for a similar concept designated as Minimum Requirement of Eligible Liabilities (MREL) applicable to all banks.  The ongoing MREL regulatory preparations, in parallel with TLAC implementation, will be key to ensure a consistent approach towards loss absorbing capacity. The way MREL will be calibrated by the Single Resolution Mechanism will also have an important impact on banks. The preliminary announcements to the industry and a possible interpretation of the Delegated Regulation recently published by the EU Commission, has led to estimates of MREL eligible liabilities by market analysts that would imply new subordinated debt issuance needs in the order of EUR 560 bn.[12] Such high required levels of issuance also stem from the assumption that existing senior bank bonds that do not have a subordination clause would not be counted to fulfil MREL. Such a requirement for subordination exists in the TLAC standard but the BRRD omits the issue and the EU Commission or the Single Resolution Board have not yet clarified what will be applied in the case of MREL. The whole set of issues related to MREL have to be addressed with great care, as very high, new requirements of subordinated debt or capital would not easily be absorbed in present market conditions and would therefore lead to financial stability concerns. Ultimately, the level of MREL required for a bank should depend on how it is planned to be resolved. On this\\xa0matter, let me note that the BRRD sets no direct or automatic link between determining the MREL level, and the 8% bail-in rule enables the use of the resolution fund for absorbing losses or to recapitalise a bank. They are separate requirements, which serve different purposes, and therefore also have different scopes.   2.3. Low interest rate environment  Beyond the structural trends and regulatory developments described earlier, the current low interest rate environment, at global level, also poses important challenges for the banking sector. To understand why interest rates are so low, it is useful to refer to the concept of an equilibrium (or neutral) real interest rate. The importance of this concept is that it provides a sort of anchor to a monetary economy, implying that monetary policy needs to shadow the real equilibrium rate in order to meet its price stability mandate. When applying different model-based methods to estimate the real equilibrium rate for the euro area, it emerges that, in comparison to pre-crisis years, estimates of the equilibrium real rate have sharply declined during the crisis and have continued on a declining trend and are now in negative territory, as is the case for the U.S. (see Chart 2). If the real equilibrium rate is decreasing then failure of monetary policy to accompany the downward trend would leave the economy with too high borrowing costs with respect to the return on investment. In turn, this would discourage investment and consumption and generate recessionary and deflationary pressures.[13]      2.4. Regulation of shadow banking and the boundary problem The regulatory reforms for the banking sector are contributing to a shift of activity and the emergence of new players in the non-banking space, which in turn is leading to tougher competition in areas traditionally dominated by banks.  To ensure a level playing field and to contain the emergence of new risks beyond banking, we need to continue our efforts to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for non-banks and market-based activities. In my view, while we have improved our understanding of the risks in this part of the financial system, there is still significant work ahead of us to overcome the potential weaknesses in the regulation of entities and activities in this sector. Let me mention two areas where important efforts are currently underway. First, at the global level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has just published its consultation paper on addressing structural vulnerabilities in the asset management sector. The paper lays out various recommendations that aim at strengthening the resilience of asset management and investment funds. Second, at the EU level, the work of the European Banking Authority (EBA) on the new prudential regime for investment firms is well under way. This new regime will cover a significant number of non-bank entities providing investment services. As recommended in the EBA report of December 2015, the regime is expected to have three tiers, aiming at introducing risk-sensitivity and proportionality.\\xa0Systemic bank-like entities are expected to be subject to the full CRR/CRD IV requirements, and less significant entities subject to less onerous and more specific requirements.  Another important aspect in dealing with the risk stemming from shadow banking activities relates to the introduction of macroprudential margins and haircuts in SFTs, including repos, as well as in OTC Derivatives transactions.[14]  These tools would reach beyond the banking system and also address the build-up of leverage and liquidity risks in parts of the financial system, where we have seen rapid growth in recent years. Macroprudential authorities should have the power to set margins and haircuts. Margins and haircuts are a determinant of the build-up of leverage via derivatives and SFTs, and are strongly interlinked with the procyclicality of that leverage. For derivatives, the initial margin determines the amount of exposure that can be created for a given amount of equity. In turn, the size of the haircut on SFT collateral, particularly in repos, determines the amount of funding market players can obtain for a given amount of collateral. In exuberant times, low volatility and risk-aversion as well as competitive pressure lead to low margins and haircuts, supporting the build-up of leverage. When the cycle turns, higher volatility and higher risk aversion feed into higher margins and haircuts, amplifying de-leveraging pressures. As a result, a vicious cycle can emerge, where higher margins and haircuts force de-leveraging and more sales, generating a liquidity spiral. That is what Gary Gorton called “the run on repo” in the core of the recent financial crisis [15]. The practices of re-use and re-hypothecation of securities also deserves to be looked into and limited. These practices amplified the expansion of inside liquidity, creating the liquidity illusion that all individual institutions were well funded which was proven not true when “the run on repo” unfolded with significantly higher haircuts.  Another important measure to mitigate excessive leverage in the shadow banking sector would be to introduce prudential leverage ratios. To monitor and impose a limit on both simple and synthetic leverage ratios, built by the use of derivatives, would be essential. Appropriately, the monitoring of the two concepts of leverage is included in the FSB proposed policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities.   3. The alchemy of banks, the financial crisis and structural reform proposals The discussion about the expansion of non-bank banking activities raises the issue whether a more fundamental reform of the monetary and financial system is necessary to reduce the probability of financial and banking crises. The essential fragility of banks, and now of the market-based credit system, is the enormous maturity transformation inherent to their activity, where the commitment to honour short-term liabilities – either in the form of deposits or short-term securities – has to be ensured at all moments.  In the past, the privilege of creating money by taking-in deposits, resulting from the extension of credit, justified the more intense regulation of banking. However, as explained earlier, other entities or activities are also now engaged in creating forms of money, increasing the maturity transformation and leverage of the system while not being regulated as banks. Trying to contain leverage in the financial system by just putting more demands on banks will not address the system expanding outside the boundary.  Proposals to address the problem have emerged since the crisis and try to put an end to “the alchemy of banking”, thus eliminating panics and runs either on deposits or on repos and similar short-term liquidity “promises”.  Building on ideas dating back to the 1930s, the proposal of Narrow Banking, sustains that banks would collect deposits remunerated at very low interest and would only invest in very safe and short-term assets, such as government treasury bills. Extending credit to firms would not be permitted, for not being sufficiently safe. Financing of investment would have to come from capital markets or firms’ self-financing.  There is a variety of versions of this proposal, the famous one being the so-called Chicago Plan, proposed in 1930 by Chicago professor, Irving Fisher and also temporarily supported by Milton Friedman, whereby a 100% liquid reserve requirement would be applied to all deposits.[16] The principles of Narrow Banking were subsequently adopted by the Positive Money movement, an international social movement active in 12 countries.  Besides generating a financial system that would not create enough funding for investment and growth, the approach brought to the present times has the major flaw of not addressing the “boundary problem” as it addresses only the role of banks.  Another proposal - Limited Purpose Banking - put forward by Laurence Kotlikoff in 2010[17] would transform all financial institutions into entities fully funded with equity, like mutual or investment funds. Entities could extend credit but a public institution should be in charge of validating the respective ratings of those credits. Also in this case, the approach would lead to insufficient finance for economic development.  An interesting and challenging vision is described in the book The end of banking [18] written by a macroeconomist and an investment banker under a pseudonym. The proposal is not only the end of banks but also the end of banking activity, defined as the “creation of money out of credit”. It rests on two main elements: new digital technologies and new accounting rules that would impede the “creation of money out of credit” by any type of firm. In this case, the boundary problem is explicitly recognised and addressed.  The first element – digitalisation – will allow the unbundling of banks’ functions by different types of firms using digital techniques. The pooling that banks do by collecting small deposits can be done over the internet; diversification of credits using hard big data to select, scoring, rating and monitoring borrowers and loans’ credit risk, are also made possible by digital algorithms; maturity transformation and supply of liquidity services can be achieved by offering market liquidity: custody accounts (not deposits) would offer immediate liquidity by rapidly selling assets in the market. While not being cash-deposit liquidity, the speed and optimisation software functions would get very close to it.  Unbundling of these functions is already taking place with FinTech and it will be completed easily, according to the authors.  However, the new FinTech institutions could still try to do banking by matching liquidity “promises” with securitised or unsecuritised credit. The second element of the proposal impedes this by introducing a new legal and accounting concept of insolvency, that the authors call a systemic solvency rule. A firm would be insolvent if its real assets would become less than its total liabilities. Financial assets would thus not be counted as real assets. A different way to enunciate the rule is that a firm would be insolvent whenever its financial assets exceed its common equity. In this way, financial assets created by credit will have to be funded by equity and so the alchemy of creating money out of credit could not hold. The proposal is not much different from Limited Purpose Banking whereby financial firms are a sort of mutual or investment fund. While financial technology would dispense with any government intervention, the proposal is not more viable than the Limited Purpose Banking, in my view.  In his recent book, Mervyn King proposes another approach to the problem of creation of money or quasi-money through the granting of credit either in the form of loans or the purchase of securities. In a nutshell, the proposal is as follows: all financial firms’ assets when funded by short-term liabilities would have mandatorily to be reported to the central bank and a haircut would be negotiated to be applied for the provision of central bank liquidity should a situation of liquidity stress emerge. The haircuts would be negotiated well in advance of any stressful situation and the agreed liquidity provision would be extended without any other conditions. The potential huge extension of central bank liquidity with monetary policy consequences and the possibility of significant losses to the central bank in a crisis, with rapidly declining asset valuations, renders the proposal controversial and fraught with difficult practical implementation problems. It should also be stressed that the proposal, although aware of the boundary problem, does not eliminate the possibility of creation of money and quasi-money out of credit. What it does is to eliminate the liquidity crises that are normally the triggers of financial crises. If and when inside liquidity would fail, outside (central bank) liquidity would be readily available at a price.  A different approach to the central problem of the vulnerabilities created by the emergence of a lightly regulated sector creating short-term liabilities is suggested by Morgan Ricks in his recent book.[19] It consists of establishing the legal obligation that all forms of short-term liabilities created by financial institutions would have to be insured against a fee by an official institution, similarly to what happens to deposits. This is certainly feasible but although reassuring users of financial services, the scheme is not so encompassing as the one proposed by Mervyn King and would not avoid liquidity strains in a crisis or the creation of money out of credit.  In conclusion, this analysis shows that it is difficult, if not impossible, for our economies - so dependent on credit to invest and grow - to dispense with banking as an activity. Despite being under siege with great needs of consolidation in the sector, banks are not going to disappear in the near term.   4. European banking sector: facts and challenges  Let me turn to some of the more specific challenges that euro area banks are facing in the post-crisis environment. First, I will focus on the low profitability environment banks operate in and then address the structural challenges related to overcapacity in some banking markets and the large stock of NPLs. Finally, I will discuss the prospects for bank consolidation and some aspects of the resolution regime.  4.1. Low profitability  A key challenge for European banks is linked to the prolonged period of low profitability in the sector. While bank profitability has recovered somewhat recently, it remains at very low levels. Euro area significant banks’ average Return on Equity (ROE) was 5.8% in 2015, remaining below their cost of capital (estimated to be around 9%). In fact, the negative gap between banks’ ROE and cost of equity has persisted since the 2008 financial crisis despite some narrowing in this gap recently (see Chart 3).    Furthermore, analysts remain unconvinced of the prospect of a significant recovery in bank profitability in the near future. This is also reflected in continued low market valuations of euro area banks. While market scepticism regarding banks’ earnings outlook pushed down price-to-book ratios around the globe (see Chart 4) during the episode of heightened financial market volatility at the start of 2016, a continuing wedge between euro area and U.S. banks may partly reflect the greater challenges euro area banks are facing in restoring profitability and adjusting to a post-crisis intermediation model.    The continued weakness in bank profitability reflects a number of factors, including both cyclical and structural challenges. A key cyclical challenge is linked to the difficulties in increasing revenues in a low nominal growth and low interest rate environment and a flat yield curve. The impact of the low interest environment on margins will vary across banks due to differences in banks’ ability to reprice deposits or in the interest rate sensitivity of their assets (including, for instance, the relative share of floating vs fixed rate loans). That said, compressed margins are only one side of the coin as the positive impacts of our monetary policy accommodation helps offset the pressure on margins - through increased credit volumes, lower impairment costs, higher capital gains on securities holdings as well as through funding cost benefits from the TLTRO II. Turning to structural factors, in line with ECB analysis, the IMF recently highlighted some key structural challenges for the banking sector that include the large stock of non-performing assets, excess capacity in the banking sector and the incomplete adjustment of business models. Let me address each of these factors in turn.  First, a large stock of legacy non-performing assets in certain banking sectors continues to dampen profitability prospects of banks with high NPLs that consume capital and do not generate revenue while it also ties up operational capacity and involves legal, as well as administrative costs. The problem of NPLs is more related to its impact on profitability that on the robustness of balance sheets, as the coverage by provisions and collateral is 95% on average. Second, there are signs that overcapacity in some banking sectors could hinder the recovery of profitability also given still subdued demand for loans. In fact, there is some empirical evidence that EU banks operating in less concentrated markets tended to be less profitable in the period between 1991 and 2013.[20] Chart 5 shows how the degree of concentration in banking sectors affects their efficiency in terms of cost/income ratios,     Third, the adaptation of business models to the new operating environment is incomplete. Accordingly, banks’ return to sustainable profitability and thus banking sector stability will depend on their ability to adapt their business mix to the new operating environment. The financial crisis and new regulatory requirements have had a profound impact on banks’ activities and business models. Pre-crisis profitability levels of many banks were boosted by high leverage and/or reliance on relatively cheap wholesale funding as well as, in some cases, elevated risk-taking (in real estate lending or securitisation exposures) in order to generate revenues. Changes in banks’ behaviour and in the regulatory framework have rendered some of the (previously) most profitable business strategies less viable which, coinciding with weak macroeconomic and financial market conditions, has led to deteriorating financial performances since the crisis. Banks’ return to sustainable profitability and thus banking sector stability will depend on their ability to adapt their business mix to the new operating environment.    Chart 6 [21] shows that banks have been moving in the direction of increasing retail banking, have improved significantly their leverage ratio (equity over assets) and reduced their reliance in wholesale funding, decreasing their transformation ratio (see chart on the left above). At the same time, fees and commissions have been increasing although they are still below levels in other jurisdictions (see chart on the right above). What is also striking is that the cost/income ratio has stayed stable, indicating that the banks have not been sufficiently effective in reducing costs.   4.2. Non-performing loans  As I highlighted earlier, cyclical profitability challenges in some countries are amplified by the large stock of non-performing assets. Euro area significant institutions held nearly EUR 950 billion of nonperforming loans (NPLs) at the end of 2015, equivalent to about 9% of euro area GDP, and their average NPL ratio, at 7.1%, is high by international standards and clearly exceeds those of US and UK peers.[22] NPL ratios vary widely across the euro area, but remain at rather elevated levels in the majority of countries that were most affected by the financial crisis.  At the same time, progress in reducing NPL remains slow, which can be explained by a number of impediments to the decisive resolution of NPLs. These include institution-specific factors, such as limited operational capacity or the lack of adequate management experience. In addition, there are a number of structural factors impeding the swift resolution of NPLs, including flawed personal and corporate insolvency laws, inefficient judicial systems, the lack of effective out-of-court workout frameworks, an underdeveloped NPL servicing industry and NPL market as well as tax impediments.  As I mentioned before, the presence of high NPLs has a significant impact on banks’ profitability, as a sizeable part of the assets are not generating revenue. This however does not raise issues about bank solvency. There is a misleading perception that the Asset Quality Review (AQR) and stress tests done in 2014 should have cleaned up the NPLs from the banks’ balance sheets. AQR and stress test exercises are not about taking NPLs out of banks’ balance sheets but about ensuring that with a proper valuation there are enough provisions and capital to ensure the point-in-time solvency of the institution. These exercises are solvency or capital exercises done over a relatively short horizon and not about longer term projections of banks’ profitability.  An AQR assesses the appropriateness of valuations of NPLs using a sampling approach, and usually marks them down in line with their fair value. This creates a gap in the balance sheet that has to be filled by provisions or capital. It is a point-in-time exercise and it was thoroughly conducted in 2014, implemented by almost 500 external auditors and experts in SSM countries. The balance sheet valuation of the banks was then corrected and static solvency fully assured at that moment. As mentioned before, the exercise was not about reducing NPLs to zero in one go all and related collateral or about cleaning up the whole balance sheet.  EBA stress tests use a static balance sheet methodology that assumes that the initial balance sheet quantities, including NPLs, remain unchanged throughout the three year horizon of the test. They deal with NPLs by changing in the adverse scenario the Loss Given Default (LGD), translating predefined macroeconomic adverse scenarios into LGD projections, thereby generating losses and reducing capital. In the 2014 exercise, these losses had to be covered by an increase in capital if the capital ratio came below the established minimum threshold (which was 5.5 % CET1 under the adverse scenario).  Stress tests are capital, or solvency exercises, conducted annually to check if the banks, after incurring the losses associated with materialisation of an adverse scenario, remain solvent with a capital ratio above the minimum requirements. These exercises, by definition, do not investigate profitability developments over five or six years and ways to enhance profitability by getting rid of poorly remunerated assets (such as NPLs). The projections of net profits in the stress test are not only over a relatively short horizon but also assume a static approach. In reality, banks would react to the adverse conditions by changing assets and liabilities. However, if anything, the static approach is more demanding for banks because it ignores the relative improvements they could engineer under stress by adjusting their balance sheets.  In particular, stress test exercises cannot capture the enhanced ongoing efforts in banks with high NPL ratios. Resolution of NPLs does not involve only collateral liquidation but also debt restructuring for viable distressed debtors. Restructuring positively contributes to the future profitability of banks with high level of NPLs. NPL resolution is anyhow a lengthy and complex process, and its full positive effects will materialise only beyond the horizon of the stress test.  In conclusion, stress tests analyse only the solvency of banks, do it annually but do not test the profitability of banks going forward into horizons beyond a couple of years. If profitability continues to be low in the future and the bank does not retain profits to build-up capital, then the stress test simulates again losses in an adverse scenario and if there is a capital shortfall below the defined threshold, capital will have to be increased. A capital exercise is not a medium-term business plan for banks and does not deal with scenarios of reducing NPLs.  Beyond AQR and stress test results, the management and the supervisors of banks then have to discuss forward-looking business plans as well as the necessary measures to maintain the banks sound and profitable which in the present conditions requires a reduction of NPLs. The resolution of the large post-crisis NPL overhang in Europe requires a comprehensive strategy involving coordination among all relevant stakeholders. Clearly, there is a large role to play for micro-prudential supervision in addressing NPL issues. Accordingly, the SSM has established a separate task force to focus on the NPL issue and to design the best response and long-term strategy for banks to reduce their NPLs levels.  In addition, structural polices need to complement the supervisory response and address major institutional and structural impediments to NPL resolution. These should include measures to improve the legal environment relevant for NPL workouts, for instance by introducing efficient personal and corporate insolvency frameworks as well as speeding up debt recovery. Other areas for improvement include distressed debt markets as well as impediments related to taxation. In parallel, banks should further strengthen internal workout capabilities and, if needed, use external expertise of distressed asset managers, while authorities should support the development of an NPL servicing industry and of an efficient NPL market, as well as the carve-out of specific NPL portfolios and their transfer to special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) or their outright sale on the market. Regarding the latter, asset management companies (AMCs), often benefitting from state support, were used in the crisis by several euro area countries to separate troubled assets from going concern banks. However, the attractiveness of asset separation schemes has fallen significantly since the implementation of revised State Aid rules in 2013, as a result of very strict interpretations, with financial stability considerations playing a minor role, even if mentioned in the regulation. The present situation, after a new round of reduced stock prices following Brexit, deserves a deep reflection about the offsetting of some market failures with a small public support to markedly improve the stability of some banking sectors.  Without this approach, the only solution available will be for supervisors to impose time limits for writing-off NPLs which realistically will then take several years to reach reasonable levels. In any case, improving conditions of the work-out of bad assets in the balance sheet of banks, changing legislation to speed up collateral execution, facilitating the expansion of a secondary market for bad assets, are anyhow essential to overcome the whole problem as efficiently and fast as possible.   4.3. Overcapacity in the banking sector One of the structural impediments to the recovery of bank profitability is related to the overcapacity in some parts of the euro area. Market concentration has been on an upward trend both at the euro area and EU level since the pre-crisis period.[23]     Taking a cross-country view, significant differences remain across countries. Banking systems in larger countries, such as Germany and Italy are more fragmented, and concentration levels tend to be lower (see Chart 7). By contrast, banking systems in smaller countries tend to be less fragmented and more concentrated. These stark differences in market concentration are partly a reflection of structural features of the banking sector, due to the important role of savings or cooperative banks. With regard to capacity indicators, the resizing of the banking sector since the financial crisis was also accompanied by a decline in the number of bank branches and employees per population in the past few years. While this generally brought about some improvement in banks’ cost-to-income ratios, some banking systems continue to show indications of excess capacity (for instance, countries characterised by high bank branch per capita ratios). With all these factors taken together, it can be argued that there is scope for further consolidation without reinforcing the so-called “too-big-to-fail” problem and for reaping the benefits of efficiency-driven consolidation. The same is true about the euro area as a whole.   4.4. Prospects for bank consolidation Overcapacity in parts of the banking sector, coupled with the ongoing structural trend towards market-based financing, imply that the European banking sector is bound to continue to shrink in the future. This raises the important question of how to achieve a reduction in excess capacity in the banking sector without triggering bank distress and negatively affecting economic activity. The possible ways of consolidation in the banking sector include Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A, domestically and across borders), the downsizing of business activities (especially by large and complex banks) as well as resolution and orderly exits.  In principle, M&As accompanied by downsizing are the best option for consolidation in the sector with the banking union providing a favourable backdrop. Ultimately, the euro area economy needs banks that are large and efficient enough to operate and diversify risks on a cross-border basis within a European single market, but small enough to be resolved with the resources of the Single Resolution Fund. This would help reap the full benefits of the banking union and improve the trade-off between financial stability and economic efficiency. From banks’ perspective, operating efficiencies are likely to become the primary M&A motivation in a low profitability environment with cross-border credit risk diversification benefits being a possible additional driver. Despite the clear rationale for bank consolidation via M&As, the merger wave seen in the period 2005-07 is unlikely to be repeated in the foreseeable future (see Chart 8).    Looking at post-crisis trends, total M&A activity in the EU banking sector has declined since the high values recorded in 2007, especially in terms of the value of transactions, but also in terms of the number of transactions.  Regarding the prospects of reducing excess capacity via resolution and orderly exits, the changed regulatory landscape - with enhanced early intervention, recovery and resolution tools in place - should in principle help to pursue a constructive path to consolidation. Indeed, it will be possible to preserve critical functions, by intervening early and restructuring a bank, or in the resolution stage, by selling critical parts of the failing bank to a private sector buyer or by setting up a bridge bank, for example. Orderly resolution will thus not entail the mere collapse of a bank, which could be value-destroying and endangering financial stability, but would allow consolidating the banking sector by preserving its value.  Clearly, all resolution processes will have to be implemented in accordance with the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the more transformative piece of legislation in the context of the Banking Union. One of its fundamental features is that the use of resources from the Single Resolution Fund (with or without a fiscal backstop) or from any public programme, can only take place after a bail-in of shareholders and creditors amounting to at least 8% of total liabilities of a given bank, including own funds. The level of 8% is very substantial compared to the losses banks faced in the recent crisis. Between 2008 and 2010, only one bank incurred losses in excess of the 8% threshold, and the average for all banks was slightly less than 3%. If we look further back at the Nordic financial crisis in the 1990s, the banks affected endured losses well below 8% of their total liabilities including own funds. Thus, under the BRRD, the use of money from the Resolution Fund or, after that, from public programmes (either national or from direct European recapitalisation), should occur extremely rarely, if at all. Additionally, as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) has been postponed, one can conclude that, in the context of Banking Union, there is now a low level of risk sharing, contrary to what was the case during the first years of the crisis. The IMF, in its recent April issue of the Global Financial Stability Review alerts to this problem: “The European Union State Aid rules -…. and the BRRD are important checks on market distortions and moral hazard, but they should be implemented carefully, as public support may still be needed in a crisis. […] The new mandatory bail-in regime under the BRRD could raise implementation challenges. Building sufficient institution-specific buffers will take time, and in the meantime the new legal framework limits the use of public funds without creditor bail-in at a time when pockets of weakness are still to be found in banks.”   These words of caution by the IMF imply that while the BRRD has of course to be applied, it should be considered in its entirety, including the possible use of the exemption for financial stability reasons, at the national or European levels, as foreseen in its Article 32. In my 2014 speech here in Madrid at this same event organised by the University of Navarra, I said: “I fully support the change of culture from easy public bailouts to a new culture of private bailing-in […] Yet, we need to bear in mind that it is not only direct public support for banks that has a cost for taxpayers, but also financial instability – indeed, the costs of the latter may be higher. Compare the worldwide costs for taxpayers stemming from the absence of public intervention to rescue Lehman Brothers, with the zero cost for taxpayers following the USD 700 billion injection into U.S. banks in 2008 (which have been totally repaid by the banks). In other words, financial instability can have a meaningful cost to taxpayers even if it is not visible in the very short term – a notion that all policy makers should keep in mind.”   5. The response by the banks  What I have outlined today is that in the post-crisis environment, banks are facing a number of difficult challenges. How should banks respond to these challenges?  Banks’ strategic responses to the changed business and operating environment imply the adaptation of business models. There is no “one-size-fits-all” strategy for business model adjustment and the optimal strategy will depend on the starting point of each individual bank and on its operating environment. Concentration in their core competences and divestment of ancillary activities will be necessary in many cases.  Given the cyclical profitability challenges arising from the low interest rate environment, banks will have to continue increasing the share of fees and commissions’ income. International comparisons suggest that euro area banks have significant room to expand non-interest income. However, such a shift is likely to be gradual and is also dependent on competition from both within and outside the banking sector.  Another clear avenue to address profitability pressures is to further increase cost efficiency. The ongoing trend of customers shifting towards digital platforms for banking services has important implications for banks’ business models and their cost containment strategies. Such strategies include, among other things, a rationalisation of the retail branch network and improving multichannel distribution capacities. This in turn also requires additional costly investment into IT infrastructures that could lead to significant cost savings in the long term, both in terms of expanding the customer base and enhanced product distribution.  Banks with high levels of NPLs, with or without any European policy support, will have to steeply improve their workout capacity to deal with the problem.  Banks should also take advantage of central bank policies, and in particular the new series of Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO II). To recall, these new operations offer long-term funding at attractive conditions to banks to further ease private sector credit conditions and to further incentivise bank lending to the real economy. Looking at the implications of monetary policy accommodation in their entirety, it is important to stress that its positive effects - through increased credit volumes but also lower impairment costs, capital gains on debt securities as well as lower funding cost of the TLTRO II – have the potential to offset the pressure on margins.   Conclusion Let me conclude. Our monetary policy has been the only expansionary policy in the euro area. Putting together all its policy effects, it has undoubtedly helped banks, as the improvement in profitability since 2013 illustrates. We trust that we will achieve normalisation of inflation levels in the next few years, which will change the macroeconomic environment for the better, thereby supporting the banking sector. At the same time, we are well aware of collateral effects of our policy on the economy and know the limits of certain policy instruments.  As I mentioned earlier today, banks are not going to disappear any time soon under a wave of Fintech start-ups. However, in the present situation we must count on the ingenuity, effort and competence of the banks to change into more efficient institutions with lower cost/income ratios and with the capacity to face fierce competition in a world of changing technology. Only a robust and profitable banking sector can serve the economy and finance the economic growth that we need. Thank you for your attention.

These markets have weird names—like repo, Eurodollars, and asset-backed commercial paper—but this confusing terminology belies their simplicity. These markets are not exotic at all.

These biennial conferences are by now a well-established tradition and always give new and valuable impetus to our work in the field of statistics.  The title of today’s conference is “Central bank statistics: moving beyond the aggregates”. Disaggregated data are indeed necessary to identify and analyse the heterogeneity that characterises the real world. For central banks this is particularly important: to implement policy in the most effective way, we need to know how our policy actions affect all sectors of the economy. Both the challenges posed by the current economic climate for monetary and macroprudential policy, and the information required to carry out microprudential supervision by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) increase our need for granular data.  But this need for a greater level of disaggregation of data comes with its own challenges. The first one is to ensure that data are collected in a way that permits multiple uses. This requires greater harmonisation, and an ability to share data between institutions in a way that still respects confidentiality. The second challenge is to engage with the financial sector to ensure that the increase in data collection does not become burdensome.   Why the need for granular data? Improving the collection of disaggregated data will support the ECB’s main policy functions in several ways.  On the monetary policy side, greater understanding of the functioning of money markets and of the impact of the monetary transmission mechanism on individual sub-sectors of the economy helps to underpin our analysis of unconventional monetary policy tools and to effectively target future measures. Indeed, this week saw the official go-live of the reporting of data on up to 35,000 daily transactions in the money market, complete with information on quantities, prices and counterparties. This is a very rich information set, crucial for our liquidity management and for understanding the first step of the monetary transmission mechanism. Collecting more granular data also helps us to better understand the transmission process through the economy more broadly. We need more information on the linkages between individual sectors of the economy and, even more so, between large financial institutions. There are some important areas of the financial sector where we lack complete statistical coverage, especially relating to what we call the “shadow banking system”. These areas include some complex market products and instruments.  Similarly, our new responsibilities in European banking supervision call for new data concepts and definitions, greatly extending the need for granular data. A successful start has been made, with a new set of legal acts. The collection of loan-by-loan data is already being implemented, but further improvements are possible. In particular, we need to make sure that the data we collect are of a high quality and comparable.   Effective data integration and cooperation But today’s conference is about more than just collecting additional data. The sharing of data by authorities is also critical. Doing this effectively and efficiently, while maintaining data confidentiality, is a priority for policymakers. It requires action from policy institutions and lawmakers. Putting in place the right architecture will permit a faster and more efficient response to requests across all our policy areas, greatly enhancing the usefulness of granular data. We have made some progress on the legal foundations for sharing granular data. Council Regulation 2533/98 has been amended to permit the ECB to (re)use confidential statistical information to perform its supervisory tasks. The information can also be shared with Union institutions, including supervisory and resolution authorities, the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Stability Mechanism for the purposes of prudential supervision and ensuring financial stability. This is a major achievement. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has also taken important steps to improve the harmonisation and standardisation of data. The current work on the Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary, a joint project involving seven national central banks and 26 commercial banks under the leadership of the ECB, is the best example. This process could and should ultimately enable us to organise the various reporting requirements into a single, comprehensive and harmonised European Reporting Framework.  But the need for harmonisation and standardisation also extends beyond Europe. Finance is a global business, and both the regulation and the underlying data requirements for global institutions would benefit from more harmonisation worldwide. Concrete steps towards standardisation include the establishment of mandatory requirements regarding the use of the International Securities Identification Number and the global Legal Entity Identifier. Europe should retain its prominent role in the implementation of the second phase of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative.   Engagement with industry As the banking industry has pointed out, lack of standardisation pushes up costs for the private sector and heightens the risk of mistakes or misinterpretation. And there is some truth to this view.  Policymakers and the industry clearly have a shared interest in focusing on and discussing data collection. It would allow banks to contain their reporting burden and remain competitive at the global level. And it would allow policymakers to improve the quality and relevance of the data they receive. The two groups have quite different roles, but they also share common goals.  As such, data collection should be a joint exercise carried out by the authorities and the banking industry. They can support each other and jointly benefit from the results. After all, there is likely to be a large overlap between the data the authorities need and the data managers of a financial institution require for their own purposes. Standardising the identifiers of counterparties, transactions, products and reporting requirements in general falls within our mandate and is probably our best course of action. I know that this is easier said than done. The establishment of European banking supervision under the auspices of the ECB, and of the three European Supervisory Authorities,[1] gives us a unique opportunity to make progress in this area in Europe.  Conclusion Let me finish by saying that the well-established ESCB statistics will continue to provide the “big picture” of economic developments. But we should also offer a magnifying glass. Looking at the details beyond the aggregates enriches our understanding of economic phenomena and at the same time increases our flexibility to respond to unexpected policy needs, contributing to even better statistics.  So, once again, I welcome you to this conference and also take this opportunity to thank all the organisers for their efforts in making it happen. I wish all of you an interesting and successful day. I hope you find some answers to the challenges I have mentioned, and I look forward to hearing the results of your discussions.

I am very pleased to see that so many distinguished participants from all over the world have gathered here in Frankfurt today. The title of this year’s conference is “Central bank statistics: moving beyond the aggregates”. Beyond the aggregates lies a whole world of facts and observations that feed into granular statistics – namely, statistical data that need to be collected, checked, disseminated and, eventually, analysed by policymakers. In fact we would like, this year, to discuss with you the paradigm shift that central banking statistics are currently undergoing: the move from macro to micro statistics, or from aggregate to granular statistics, if you like. That move is nothing short of a big bang for central bank statistics. In a sense, it resembles what happened in the 1930s, when the Great Depression moved the focus of economic analysis from equilibrium to fluctuations and downturns, eventually fostering the development of national income accounts. Similarly, in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, we saw a huge and sudden increase in heterogeneity, or “fragmentation”, in several dimensions: across and within economic sectors, geographic areas and market segments. We have learnt that aggregate statistics, although of high quality and internationally standardised, do not suffice any more as a basis for good decision-making. What we need are high-quality and timely granular datasets and indicators. I will elaborate more on this in a minute. So, once again, big changes in statistics have been triggered by dramatic economic events which challenged the status quo and added to policymakers’ demands for information.   Moving beyond the aggregates – impetus and initiatives For the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), there are at least two reasons for moving “beyond the aggregates”.  First, we had to change the way in which we fulfil our mandate, that is, maintaining price stability through monetary policy. Following the dramatic change in the economic environment since the onset of the financial crisis, we have, for instance, adopted a number of unconventional monetary policy measures, such as targeted liquidity provision and an asset purchase programme. These measures are quite different from the traditional approach of setting an interest rate. As you can imagine, conducting this kind of unconventional monetary policy is rather difficult when decisions have to be taken on the basis of conventional data, i.e. traditional aggregate statistics. Mitigating systemic risk in very turbulent times on that same basis is equally difficult.  Second, the ECB has been assigned additional functions as a result of the crisis. We\\xa0became responsible for banking supervision, of course, but we also received a mandate on macroprudential policy. In addition, the ECB now has to support the statistical needs of the European Systemic Risk Board. Not surprisingly, these new functions and new data users have led to new challenges and a remarkable development in the field of statistics: in the last few years, the ESCB has enriched its datasets in several dimensions. Let me recall some of the most recent ones in the area of granular data, which is the theme of tomorrow’s conference. As a result of the money market statistical reporting, we started collecting in April this year up to 35,000 transaction-by-transaction data on a daily basis from 52 large banks in four different segments of the euro money market. We have gathered security-by-security data on issuances and on corresponding holdings by euro area residents. Worldwide holdings of securities by 26 individual banking groups based in the euro area are also available, and are planned to be extended to all banking groups under the ECB’s direct supervision by 2018. Using the AnaCredit dataset, we will provide policymakers, as of the second half of 2018, with a considerable amount of harmonised loan-by-loan information collected from all euro area banks by the respective national central banks. Credit data have of course a special role for the ECB. The euro area is a bank-based economy: loans are the main source of financing for companies and almost the only one for small and medium-sized enterprises. Symmetrically, loans are an important asset in banks’ balance sheets. Therefore detailed and high-quality information on credit is essential both for monetary policy and for financial stability. This is why I am convinced that AnaCredit will play a central role in supporting our key central bank functions. So, as you can see, within the ESCB we are quickly moving “beyond the aggregates”, and I am sure that this move will bring huge benefits. Let me explain why.  Lost in aggregation – the benefits of granular data By asking for aggregate data, which is pre-organised and aggregated by the reporting agents or by the national central banks, we miss lots of valuable information. After all, it is not only the average that matters, but also the underlying distribution. And in order to analyse the distribution we need the “basic” (granular) data. Let me give you a simple example. Assume that we see credit to businesses accelerating in a given country. We can think of several different developments underlying this “aggregate” fact. It might be that solid companies, with low debt and good economic perspectives, are taking out more or larger loans. Or it could be that fragile and highly indebted companies are borrowing more or are restructuring their debt just to survive. Credit might also be growing because more companies have access to bank financing. In turn, this might reflect better economic prospects and a greater appetite for investment – which is good – or just a deterioration of credit standards – which is not so good. All these possibilities (and I didn’t mention the possible factors on the credit supply side!) are consistent with growth in aggregate credit. But, clearly, they might have very different implications in terms of the monetary policy stance and risks to financial stability. Granular data will help us look beyond aggregates and reveal the underlying developments. By having granular loan-by-loan data we will know, abstracting from the respective identities, the characteristics of specific groups of counterparties involved in each transaction. Then we can assess the “driving forces” behind any aggregate development and distinguish genuine and “healthy” growth from potential bubbles. This is very important for policymakers. And the benefits of going granular also extend to those who have to provide the data in first place: the reporting agents. After the initial high set-up costs resulting from the large volumes, reporting information at a granular level brings significant savings. This is because statistical requirements are going to be more stable over time and ad hoc data requests for special or urgent policy needs are minimised. Also, the more we ask banks to provide information which resembles what they already have in their internal systems, the easier it will be for them to comply with the reporting requirements. Last but not least, in those countries where feedback loops are established by the respective national central bank, reporting agents will benefit from much more complete and harmonised information on the creditworthiness of their counterparts, in particular when they are foreign residents. On our side, even when policy decisions are taken on the basis of aggregate statistics, as is usually the case, moving towards granular data offers the big advantage of timeliness and flexibility: raw information can be organised and aggregated in different ways depending on the specific policy question at hand. This is key, given that it takes three to five years to develop new aggregate statistics, while policymakers usually want the data “yesterday”. Granular data allow us to provide the necessary statistics in a flexible and timely manner – so probably not “yesterday” but not too far from “today”. Allow me, for a moment, to compare the compilation of statistics with the making of a cake, say, a Sachertorte. Going granular is like asking banks for the basic ingredients such as chocolate, cream, flour, eggs, butter and sugar instead of asking them for a slice of Sachertorte. Our clients – policymakers, analysts and researchers – are always hungry, and they need different cakes depending on the policies they have to decide on. Once we have all the basic ingredients, we can bake a variety of cakes just by combining these ingredients in different ways. So we don’t have to go shopping every time, which makes it easier for us, and which makes it easier for those who have to provide the ingredients, that is, the banks.  New challenges ahead Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that I have convinced you all of the benefits of moving “beyond the aggregates” – including those of you who do not fancy baking cakes. I should add though that granular statistical information also poses new challenges.  First and foremost, granular datasets need to be standardised and well integrated. We have to prevent any build-up of disconnected “silo” data collections. We should no longer request the same data twice, and whenever we cannot avoid requesting similar information twice we have to explain why. Once collected, we have to make sure we can combine the data from different granular datasets as necessary.  Second, granular datasets must be multi-purpose: they need to serve different users and support different analyses, all at the same time. AnaCredit is a great example of this; it is designed to support different key central bank functions.  Third, keeping in mind the need for integration and versatility, we must provide financial institutions with a unified reporting framework – a framework that is based on a consistent and stable set of rules and definitions. This is precisely what we are doing with the current work to define an ECB Single Data Dictionary and an integrated European Reporting Framework.  Fourth, we need to adopt and manage state-of-the-art IT solutions that can process huge data volumes and ensure the necessary data confidentiality.  Last, but not least, I have already said that granular data allow us to satisfy our customers’ craving for “cakes” of all different kinds. So the remaining question is: can our customers digest all the cakes they request? Can they handle large sets of granular data? I am pretty sure they can! So, as you can see, moving “beyond the aggregates” entails quite a few challenges, but I am confident that we will master all of them.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently in the middle of a paradigm shift in which granular data is rapidly gaining relevance. And one thing is obvious: good statistics – both micro and macro – are essential tools for policymakers, helping them to take decisions and to assess the impact of those decisions on the economy. But let’s be realistic. Granular information will not save us from any future financial crisis. It will, though, put policymakers in a better position to mitigate the risks ex ante and to limit their potential impact ex post by taking the appropriate corrective measures and by monitoring their effectiveness in a timely manner. Besides offering extraordinary opportunities, this move beyond the aggregates brings big challenges, as I have already said.  New questions arise. For instance, will granular data ever replace aggregate statistics? Let me put it another way: is it possible to reduce and simplify the collection and production of aggregate statistics once sufficient individual information is available? Or do we need to collect and compile both granular and aggregate data for the purpose of cross-checking? These two kinds of statistics nicely complement each other, in my view. Micro data can be used to fill important data gaps. At the same time, aggregate statistics provide a useful benchmark for granular data, especially while these are still at an early stage of development. Nevertheless, keeping the reporting burden to a minimum is an important priority for us, therefore micro and macro data collections as we know them now cannot continue in parallel forever. As statistical reporting inevitable creates costs for third parties, we will regularly reassess our requirements, taking account of the information needs of policymakers, and at the same time constantly striving for the best possible balance between merits and costs. I am very confident that the conference tomorrow will help us to find the right answers to these and many other questions relevant for the future of central bank statistics. Thank you very much for your attention.  ']\n",
      "['2016-07-01', 'Peter Praet', 'Transmission channels of monetary policy in the current environment', 'Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Financial Times Festival of Finance,London, 1 July 2016', '  Transmission channels of monetary policy in the current environment   Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Financial Times Festival of Finance,London, 1 July 2016 Ladies and Gentlemen[1], Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007/2008, the euro area, like many other economies, has been hit by a barrage of shocks with adverse macroeconomic fall-outs. The ECB, like many other major central banks, has responded to these shocks with forceful and often unprecedented monetary policy measures – and it is firmly determined to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area.  By now, our policy response has taken the key ECB interest rates to record lows, bringing the rate on banks’ overnight deposits with the ECB to negative territory, and we expect our policy rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. In parallel, we have adopted a range of central bank asset purchase programmes, addressing securities of different issuers – private and public. And we have rolled out a set of targeted longer-term refinancing operations for euro area banks with an in-built incentive for lenders to pass on the favourable financing conditions – including negative borrowing costs – to firms and households provided they create more credit. This comprehensive package of measures provides strong support to the euro area recovery and guards euro area financial conditions against external shocks. In today’s speech I will discuss the mechanisms by which we expect these measures to transmit to the economy. And I will present recent evidence which indicates that this transmission is gradually strengthening, in a context of elevated risks, especially originating from the external environment. In my remarks, I will subdivide the transmission mechanism into two parts – one linking monetary policy actions to financial market conditions and the other linking financial market conditions to spending decisions of households and firms.  Impact of our measures on financial conditions Let me start with a discussion of how our measures are supporting financial conditions in the euro area. Here, I will put particular focus on how our negative interest rate policy, accompanied by our forward guidance, reinforces the impact of the liquidity injections provided through our asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations, since this is an aspect of our policy that, I believe, is often misunderstood in debates on the transmission of our measures.  After a steady sequence of interest rate cuts since end-2011, the deposit facility rate (DFR) has first entered negative territory in June 2014. Further rate cuts have followed, putting the DFR to minus 40 basis points at the current juncture. At first sight, the implications of these recent rate cuts to negative levels are similar to those of equally-sized rate cuts taking place in positive territory. They induce a decline in short-term money market rates which, via financial market arbitrage, transmits along the yield curve and to a wide range of asset classes. The resultant loosening in financial conditions induces firms and households to bring forward consumption and investment decisions.  This inter-temporal substitution from future to current spending supports the cyclical recovery, although a high degree of Knightian uncertainty regarding political and economic prospects may affect this channel. Further support for the impact of monetary policy comes from the cross-sectional incidence of monetary policy accommodation, which tends to divert funds from net savers with a lower marginal propensity to spend to net borrowers with a higher marginal propensity to spend.[2]  But two mechanisms reinforce the impact of a given cut in monetary policy interest rates when they move into negative territory. First, negative rates discourage – individually rational but economically costly – liquidity hoarding by banks. Second, they mitigate the monetary tightening bias that arises when market expectations on future interest rates are truncated by a perceived lower bound.  Via the first mechanism, negative interest rate policies strengthen the accommodative impact per unit of liquidity injected into the euro area financial system through our conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Banks on the receiving end of these liquidity injections face a choice whether to lend it on to the real economy, through direct credit provision to firms and households or asset purchases; or to hoard the liquidity and deposit it back with the central bank. The former option supports the economic recovery, the latter option retards transmission and mutes the stimulus that the central bank intends to inject into the system.  In negative territory, banks face a stronger inducement to rebalance their portfolios by redeploying excess liquidity holdings through lending to the real economy or asset purchases at maturities that allow them to escape the negative rates. While, on aggregate, the banking system will not be able to elude the cost of negative rates, the higher propensity to recycle their liquidity holdings strengthens the overall easing potential of our policies. ECB staff analysis indicates that these mechanisms are indeed operational, especially in countries with strong economic fundamentals: according to regression estimates at the level of individual banks, the propensity for banks to translate excess liquidity holdings into lending has increased substantially since the deposit facility rate has fallen into negative territory – raising the growth rate of bank lending in these countries from around 4% to slightly below 5% – an increase by almost 20% compared to a scenario without negative rates.[3] And the April 2016 Bank Lending Survey also saw a large share of banks indicate that the negative ECB deposit facility rate has led to declining interest rates on loans to firms and households. Meanwhile, these improvements in pass-through have been accompanied by a pronounced decline in the dispersion in bank lending rates across euro area countries since mid-2014. As a consequence, our comprehensive package of measures has also been conducive to a more even transmission of our policy to jurisdictions that had previously not been able to reap the full benefits of the accommodative monetary policy stance.  Besides this impact on the incentives for liquidity hoarding, there is a second factor by which the negative rate environment reinforces the impulse from other policy tools. This factor relates to the way expectations about the future path of monetary policy are reflected in market interest rates. At any point in time, a wide range of future interest rate paths are conceivable and market participants assign probabilities to different parts of this distribution. The yield and forward curves observed in the market comprise all future rate constellations that investors consider conceivable, weights them by their respective probabilities, and aggregates them across market participants. In normal conditions, this aggregated expectation on future interest rates tends to largely coincide with the rate path that investors consider most likely to prevail – in statistical terms, this means it reaches levels at or close to the median of the predictive distribution of future rates. However, the presence of a binding lower bound on monetary policy rates drives a wedge between actual market rates and the rate path that investors consider most likely. This is because the lower bound truncates the distribution of conceivable future short-term rates from below: interest rates below the perceived lower bound are, by definition, eliminated from the set of conceivable outcomes; vice versa, rates above the lower bound receive a higher relative weight and the expected value of interest rates is mechanically pushed up. Accordingly, the truncated asymmetric distribution of expected future rates leads to a less accommodative interest rate path than that resulting if markets could efficiently price their expectations into market rates. And the resultant tightening bias, in turn, can be very costly as it tends to arise in situations of strong disinflationary pressures that persist although the central bank has already engaged in sizeable rate cuts. A policy of negative interest rates mitigates this bias. In particular, the observation that central banks are, indeed, prepared to take interest rates to levels below zero induces a re-evaluation of technical feasibility constraints. (A salient feature of this re-evaluation is the disappearance of the qualifier “zero” in the economic debate on lower bound constraints.) Via this re-evaluation, negative rates loosen the perceived lower bound on the future distribution of short-term interest rates and, thereby, squeeze out the wedge between the rate path priced into market rates and actual market expectations.  In this way, the negative interest rate policy reinforces the effectiveness of our measures in pushing down the longer end of the yield curve. Overall, there is increasing evidence that these effects are borne out in practice. Risk-free yield curves have consistently shifted down, thus bringing important easing at the initial stages of the transmission process. Meanwhile, this easing has exerted important spill-overs across asset classes and, particularly important for a bank-based economy like the euro area, our policy measures have compressed the levels and dispersion of bank lending rates across euro area countries as explained earlier.  While we are mindful of potential adverse implications for bank profitability, we do not see those implications outweighing the benefits for the economy at this stage. In fact, there is some evidence that the beneficial effects of our policy on the valuation of banks’ securities holdings, on banks’ lower funding costs, and on banks’ expanding asset volumes and better credit quality – as the demand for intermediation rises in a growing economy and credit becomes less risky – are still offsetting the downsides of reduced unit intermediation margins.  At the same time, while the favourable impact of our policies on banks’ intermediation activities and on credit quality should strengthen through time as the economic recovery firms, the funding cost relief for banks will sooner or later run out of scope – and that will happen when banks’ entire liability structure will have repriced to the lower level of interest rates. This will detract from one force which – despite the difficult low-rate environment – is still contributing positively to banks’ capacity to generate earnings at present and is providing an important buffer against the decline in interest rates on the asset side of the bank balance sheet – especially for banks with a large share of assets remunerated at variable rates.  A further important buffer derives from the new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-II), the first of which was allotted last week. Under TLTRO-II, banks can access Eurosystem funding for a maturity of up to four years at very attractive rates – potentially falling to levels as low as the deposit facility rate for banks that display a strong lending performance. Besides providing an inducement to expand lending volumes and reduce lending rates to compete for good credit, TLTRO-II will thus also allow banks to reduce recourse to more expensive wholesale funding and replace it with attractive funding. This, in turn, will be conducive to their profitability.  Against this background, it is important to assess the impact of our policies on bank profitability not by looking at individual measures but by considering the combined effect of the full package of policy tools, including via their mutually reinforcing positive impact on macroeconomic prospects.  Nonetheless, we are monitoring developments in bank profitability and the time dimension of factors influencing lenders’ costs of liabilities and returns on assets to ensure that bank-based transmission remains effective, which may become less favourable if interest rates remain low for a protracted period of time. Meanwhile, other policy actors will have to do their part to provide a viable perspective on the future path towards completing Banking Union in Europe – a point I will return to later.  Impact of changes in financial conditions on the economy The second leg of the monetary transmission process links changes in financial conditions to the broader economy.  Typically this part is more sluggish since it takes time for firms and households to adjust their economic behaviour to changes in financial conditions. And we have indeed seen a more delayed response to our credit easing than we might have expected. That is in part because the euro area economy has been hit by several shocks since we launched those measures, in particular the slowdown in emerging markets, which have dampened the observational response of output and inflation to our policy impulses. It is also because we are still emerging from a protracted crisis that has made firms and households more hesitant to take economic risk. We are nevertheless now seeing increasing signs that the effects of our monetary stimulus are materialising, in at least three ways. First is the impact of easier borrowing conditions on the economy, which is visible in the most interest-sensitive demand components – consumption of durables and investment.  After several years of contraction, consumption of durable goods in the euro area has been rebounding, growing at rates not seen since before the crisis. The contribution of fixed capital formation to growth, which was extremely weak in the early phases of the euro area recovery, has also been progressively rising. Indeed, in the first quarter of 2016, investment and consumption contributed almost equally to the strong GDP outturn. Collectively, this has contributed to a recovery in the euro area that is now largely driven by domestic demand.  Of course, these recent data do not yet reflect the renewed uncertainty originating from the UK referendum. Such uncertainty may weigh on economic confidence and partly reverse the recent improvements in investment and consumption, also in the euro area. Accordingly, it is essential to swiftly establish an orderly process that governs the path towards a new post-referendum steady state so as to allow households and firms to swiftly adjust their inter-temporal economic decisions to the new environment.  Alongside new borrowing, our monetary policy is also supporting consumption and investment through a second channel: the impact of lower interest payments on outstanding debt.  Much has been made of the adverse implications of the low interest rate environment on interest earnings of households. But, for euro area households, interest payments have also declined substantially, coming down by about 3 percentage points relative to disposable income since 2008. As interest earnings and interest payments have fallen by roughly the same amount, the disposable income of aggregate euro area households has been largely unaffected. But what we have seen is a redistribution of purchasing power among different types of households.  While this redistribution is an unintended side-effect of monetary policy, it is not neutral for the cyclical environment. Specifically, resources have moved from net savers with a low marginal propensity to consume to net borrowers with a high marginal propensity to consume, creating an overall positive impact on aggregate consumption. This boost to disposable income has not so far been offset by increases in household saving rates in the euro area. Also for euro area firms, the impact of lower interest payments has been significant on aggregate. Since 2008, net interest payments have come down by about 7 percentage points to just 2% of gross operating surplus today.[4] This provides substantial support to firms’ profitability which is positive for future investment. Improved profitability expectations, coupled with low discount rates, have also supported a strong decline in corporate debt-to-equity ratios – measured by market metrics – driven by valuation effects in equity markets. This ‘asset price’ deleveraging should in principle feed through into a lower cost of equity for firms, giving further impetus to investment.  Monetary policy has also contributed to the recovery in a third way. As domestic demand in the euro area has rallied, the contribution of external demand to output has declined in tandem with the major slowdown in international trade. But the decline has been more muted than we would have predicted on the basis of historical records. Indeed, over the past 20 years, the growth rate of international trade has been lower than in 2015 only twice: in the aftermath of the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s, and again after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2009. Both episodes saw a contemporaneous sharp slowdown in euro area growth to a rate close to or below zero.  In 2015, however, the unexpected sharp drop in trade was not associated with a slowdown in the euro area economy. In fact, year-on-year growth even picked up throughout 2015, despite the slump in world imports, as euro area exporters, after a long spell of losses, were able to regain market shares in world demand. The divergence between the monetary policy path of the euro area and that of other major economies was one factor explaining this atypical resilience of euro area exports.  Still, the fact that these improvements have taken place in tandem with the economy receiving new shocks – such as the steep fall in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 – poses an identification problem. Put simply, how do we know that the recovery would not have happened anyway? Addressing such questions requires models which can provide indications of how the macroeconomy would have fared in the absence of monetary policy support. We have undertaken such an exercise across the Eurosystem, and the analysis tells a clear story.  Using a large and varied suite of models, Eurosystem staff find that, relative to the counterfactual scenario, our measures (excluding the March 2016 decisions) have provided significant support to output and inflation. In the absence of our policy package inflation would have been negative in 2015. In 2016 it would have been at least half a percentage point lower than we forecast currently and around half a percentage point lower in 2017. The impact of the policy measures on euro area GDP is also sizeable (again excluding the March 2016 decisions). According to the Eurosystem staff assessment, our policy is contributing to raise euro area GDP by around 1.5% in the period 2015-18.  Conclusion Let me summarise. The ongoing recovery has shown signs of strengthening, also on the back of an accelerating pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the broader economy. This accelerating pass-through shows that monetary policy is working. And the ECB is determined to continue playing its pivotal role in consolidating the upswing in the economic cycle.  At the same time, the euro area continues to be exposed to a number of uncertainties. Some are external, including the still-fragile global recovery and the impact of the UK referendum. But some are also internal. Most important is the lack of clarity for firms and households over the future institutional architecture of EMU, which remains incomplete in core areas, especially banking union. Key to removing that uncertainty is a clear roadmap for completing monetary union, which lays out both the end-point for the reform process and the sequence of steps that will lead to it. Without a clear roadmap, there is a risk that this combination of economic and institutional uncertainty will hold back the recovery in the euro area. And it has the potential to undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy as firms and households become less willing to engage in inter-temporal substitution by exploiting the favourable interest rate environment to frontload consumption and investment decisions. It weakens the capacity of the banking sector to act as a bridge between present and future spending decisions by intermediating between savers and borrowers – an issue that requires close monitoring. Against this background, monetary policy cannot be the only remedy to our current economic challenges. Instead, a broader set of actors needs to step into the breach, adopting a common approach to support the economic recovery in a context of persistent headwinds and to create durable and resilient improvement in economic performance going forward. This requires a concerted effort in the fiscal and structural policy domain to support the ongoing cyclical upswing; and a common strategy to complete and improve the institutional set-up of monetary union.

And the need for such a forum remains strong today – maybe stronger than ever. Shakespeare’s character Tranio in Taming of the Shrew exhorts us to “do as adversaries do in law – strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends”. This is an appropriate sentiment for tonight’s event: the ERA is providing food and drink and has invited me to give you all something to argue about. This is a critical juncture for the European Union (EU). A number of states have re-imposed border controls to stop the inflow of refugees, anti-EU parties are gaining popularity in many member states and one of the largest members has just voted in a referendum to leave the Union. These factors provide a challenge to our institutions and legal frameworks at EU and at national level – a challenge that also legal professionals across Europe need to engage with. I believe there are many reasons why the vision of a united Europe is worth fighting for. Let me mention just four:   to preserve peace;   to improve economic prospects;   to defend our values; and   to increase personal options continent-wide.  The founding fathers of the EU were willing to make political sacrifices to end bloodshed in Europe, following two devastating wars just decades apart. Let us not forget that we are here in a former prison in which every respected Luxembourg family had relatives who stood up for these values. After 70 years of peace in western Europe it is easy to be complacent that war will not happen again. Yet the current situation in Syria, Iraq, Ukraine and that of the Balkans in the 1990s shows that peace is vulnerable, even on our doorstep. But defence and security have to be understood as a common endeavour. The economic benefits of the Union are well documented: free trade, the removal of non-tariff barriers, the elimination of transactions costs of foreign exchange payments and the introduction of a single yield curve across the euro area to name but a few. These measures have reduced costs for businesses and households, and in turn generated higher income and created jobs. Looking ahead, also the recovery is on track to overcome the crisis. Europeans, for all our differences, have many values that we share more closely than even close allies such as the United States. Our social model ensures adequate healthcare and workers’ rights that are absent elsewhere. We value highly human and civil rights ranging from gender equality, data protection, to the condemnation of torture, including the rejection of capital punishment. The protection of these values and rights relies on the vigilance of the legal professionals here in this room and elsewhere. This is even more important vis-à-vis a reality of extreme and obsessive forms of nationalism. The EU has also increased personal choices. The ability to travel, work and live across borders has been enhanced. The European Health Insurance Card permits European citizens to obtain healthcare wherever they are. 1.5 million people, perhaps including some of you here today, have completed part of their studies in another member state as part of the Erasmus programme. More than 15 million EU citizens have moved to other EU countries to work or to enjoy their retirement. This wider range of options increases people’s wellbeing. These reasons, and the other positive aspects of membership, have been drowned out in debate by concerns over migration and the large wave of refugees from troubles in the Middle East and elsewhere, the impact of the crisis, disaffection with high levels of unemployment – especially youth unemployment, and a perceived lack of accountability and legitimacy of the EU institutions. I fully recognise that Europe in its current state is not perfect. The crisis has shown that Economic and Monetary Union is incomplete, and further work is required, particularly in the areas of banking and credit markets. In order to function democracy requires that citizens can hold decision-making accountable at the level at which these are taken. But today we can only elect and sanction at the national level, while decision making is widely done at the European level. Therefore, we have to enhance the decision-making process at the European level through appropriate democratic control measures and more direct election and sanctioning features. The solutions to these issues are not simple, and reasonable people may well disagree on their form. This forum is an ideal place to debate what laws, rules and institutions we need to put in place to strengthen the integrity of the Union. I promised earlier that I would give you something to argue about tonight! I believe the vision of a united Europe is worth striving for. To make this vision come true, we also need to understand the forces behind the populist dissatisfaction with the Union, and not dismiss them. The referendum debate in the United Kingdom has been acrimonious. In striving to deliver a united Europe, we need to be united in ourselves and build a shared EU-wide identity that delivers the necessary democratic legitimacy to the institutions.  Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.  ']\n",
      "['2016-06-28', 'Mario Draghi', 'The International Dimension of Monetary Policy', 'Introductory speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, 28 June 2016', '  The International Dimension of Monetary Policy   Introductory speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, 28 June 2016 In recent years central banks across advanced economies have been engaged in the same task, namely raising inflation and inflation expectations back to levels consistent with price stability. Each has faced conditions particular to its own jurisdiction. Each has deployed measures appropriate to its own context. And each has acted to fulfil the mandate laid down in its own constitution.  And yet, the fact that all central banks have faced a common challenge of low inflation is not coincidental. There are global factors at play. And this begs the question, what is the best way for us to deal with them?  At one extreme, central banks can take global conditions as entirely exogenous and set their policies accordingly. At the other extreme is explicit coordination of monetary policies. In between is a range of informal solutions. Whatever one’s views on these options, what is clear is that the question of the international dimension of monetary policy is becoming more pertinent, since the common factors affecting central banks are increasing.   The global drivers of inflation Indeed, a growing literature suggests that globalisation has created a common factor in inflation developments, which goes beyond fluctuations in energy or commodity prices. Higher import volumes have increased the importance of international prices and wages relative to domestic ones, making the global output gap more relevant.[1]  In that context there are two types of factors that are significant for the global low inflation environment we face today: more cyclical factors that have put downward pressure on prices; and more structural factors that have lowered the equilibrium real rate and slowed down the response of the economy to monetary policy. The first type of factors includes the large negative output gaps generated by the financial crisis and its aftermath, which still average 1% among G7 economies today.[2] This global slack has dampened in particular import and producer price inflation, both of which have been weak for several years among advanced economies. Prices set by producers in the euro area and those set by producers in trading partner countries are indeed highly correlated.[3]  Also depressing global inflation has been the slump in demand for energy and commodities linked to the slowdown in emerging markets.\\xa0This has fed not just into lower headline inflation, but also into lower underlying inflation through its effect on costs and imported prices. Indeed, if one decomposes inflation for the average advanced economy, one finds that since mid-2014 there has been a notable rise in the global component, linked largely to oil and commodity price falls.[4]  These various factors may originate only in parts of the global economy – some originate more in advanced economies, other more in emerging markets – but in an integrated world they have global effects. Cyclical weakness has spilled over through various channels into a similar challenge for all. The second type of factors is more structural in nature. They concern the global forces that have led to very low real equilibrium interest rates across advanced economies, and hence made it more complicated for monetary policy everywhere to provide the appropriate boost to global demand given an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates. In particular, this has led many central banks in the advanced economies to engage in large-scale unconventional policies.  That low interest rate environment is a consequence of a global excess of desired saving over planned investment, which results from rising net savings as populations plan for retirement; from increased demand for and lower supply of safe assets; from relatively less public capital expenditure in a context of slowing population growth in advanced economies; from the secular shift from industries intensive in physical capital to those more intensive in human capital; and from a slowdown in productivity growth that reduces returns on investment.[5]  Again, those factors may not be distributed homogenously across economies, but their effects are global because they propagate through global financial markets. With internationally mobile capital, the clearing interest rate that balances saving and investment is more a global concept than a local one. And accordingly, estimates of the equilibrium interest rate suggest that it is very low, possibly even negative, in the euro area, the US and other advanced economies.[6]  None of this means that central banks should give up on pursuing their domestic price stability mandates. We have demonstrated with our unconventional tools that it is possible to engineer accommodative financial conditions even when the equilibrium interest rate is low. And we have shown that this can be effective in supporting domestic demand and stoking domestic price pressures even when disinflationary headwinds are blowing from the global economy. But the global nature of low inflation does have two important implications.  Coping with monetary policy spillovers The first is that operating against persistent headwinds arising from abroad has forced central banks to deploy monetary policy with more intensity to deliver their mandates, and that in turn results in higher financial stability risks and spillovers to economic and financial conditions in other jurisdictions.  Such spillovers are not necessarily all negative for the global economy. On the contrary, by securing economic and financial stability in their own jurisdictions, advanced economies also help stabilise other economies through trade and financial linkages. The empirical evidence suggests that the net spillover effect of the measures taken during the crisis has been positive, especially at times – such as after the Lehman crash – when countries have faced common global shocks.[7]  At the same time, monetary policy has inevitably created destabilising spillovers as well, especially when business cycles have been less aligned. The large exchange rates fluctuations between major currencies, and the pressures some emerging economies have experienced from capital flows, are testament to that. This is not so much a result of the measures central banks have employed[8], but rather of the intensity with which they have had to be used.  These negative spillovers have led to a revival of interest in the topic of monetary policy coordination.[9] But formal monetary policy coordination is complex, for well-known reasons.[10] Central banks have national mandates, not global ones, and are accountable to their domestic parliament. This does not mean, however, that we cannot achieve a better global solution than we have today.  We have seen, for instance, how divergent monetary policies among major central banks can create uncertainty about future policy intentions, which in turn leads to higher exchange rate volatility and risk premia. That then has to be countered with more expansionary monetary policy, increasing spillover effects for others. We also know that competitive devaluations are lose-lose for the global economy, since they lead only to greater market volatility, to which other central banks are then forced to react to defend their domestic mandates.  So we would all clearly benefit from enhanced understanding among central banks on the relative paths of monetary policy. That comes down, above all, to improving communication over our reaction functions and policy frameworks. The global economy could also benefit from cooperation among spillover-initiating and spillover-receiving economies on how to mitigate unwanted side effects. One aspect that we need to understand better is how domestic monetary regimes affect the transmission of foreign monetary policy shocks. There has been a debate in recent years as to whether the famous “trilemma” of international macro has collapsed into a “dilemma”, whereby floating exchange rates no longer guarantee autonomy for domestic monetary policy, and policy independence is only possible if capital flows are in fact managed.[11] But there is also evidence that exchange rate regimes still matter. Various recent studies support the traditional view that exchange rate flexibility affords at least some degree of insulation from global shocks.[12]  Another aspect is understanding the role of domestic policies more broadly in mitigating negative spillovers. A large body of empirical work in recent years has shown that fiscal, macro-prudential, regulatory and supervisory policies can help mitigate the adverse effects of foreign monetary policy on domestic financial stability.[13] Indeed, the experience with the taper tantrum in 2013 showed how differences in domestic policy frameworks shaped how severely different economies were affected by financial spillovers.[14]  In other words, it has become clearer since the crisis that the famous “Tinbergen principle” which we apply at the domestic level also needs to be applied at the global level. Policymakers need to have sufficient instruments to deliver on their objectives. And when they do have them, they must use them.  The need for policy alignment The second implication of the global nature of low inflation is that there is a common responsibility for addressing its sources, whatever and wherever their origin.  Indeed, to the extent that the environment in which we operate is more affected by the global output gap, and the global savings-investment balance, the speed with which monetary policy can achieve domestic goals inevitably becomes more dependent on others – on the success of authorities in other jurisdictions to also close their domestic output gaps; and on our collective ability to tackle the secular drivers of global saving and investment imbalances. In a recent speech in Brussels I made a similar point regarding the interaction between monetary policy and other policies at the domestic level, such as fiscal and structural policies.[15] I maintained that central bank independence could best be described as independence in interdependence, since monetary policy can always achieve its objective eventually, but it will do so faster, and with less collateral effects, if the overall policy mix is consistent. What I am saying here is that the same applies at the global level. We may not need formal coordination of policies. But we can benefit from alignment of policies. What I mean by alignment is a shared diagnosis of the root causes of the challenges that affect us all; and a shared commitment to found our domestic policies on that diagnosis.  Today, for instance, the way in which domestic policies respond to a shortage of demand globally will vary: in some cases, the emphasis may be on increasing public investment; in others, on supporting private demand through more growth-friendly tax and regulatory policy, and of course through monetary policy. The relative stance of stabilisation policies will differ across countries depending on cyclical positions. But the sign of the effect on global demand needs to be positive.  Similarly, structural policies that aim at raising participation and productivity may take different forms in different places, but they need to achieve the same outcome, which is to increase long-term growth rates and raise equilibrium interest rates.[16] Here fora such as the G-20 can play an essential role in bringing about the appropriate alignment of policies. It is key that what is agreed in those fora is translated in the concrete policy actions. The disappointing outcome of the G-20 commitment to raise global growth by 2% with structural measures is one example of how intentions and actions can diverge. It contrasts with the more successful example that was provided by coordinated global fiscal expansion in 2008-09. Such fora of course cannot bind countries into specific actions. But mutual recognition of their common interest can act as a form of coordination device.  That common interest today is a faster closing of the global output gap, more stable global inflation, higher long-term global growth and greater global financial stability.  And such an improved policy mix would help reduce unwanted side effects of monetary policy, since the burden of stabilisation would be better shared across policies. For instance, in the current environment of global slack, the international spillovers from growth-friendly fiscal policies are likely to be wholly positive, since they primarily boost domestic demand in the home country. That is also true within regions, such as the euro area, where there are different local output gaps. The upshot is that, in a globalised world, the global policy mix matters – and will likely matter more as our economies become more integrated. So we have to think not just about whether our domestic monetary policies are appropriate, but whether they are properly aligned across jurisdictions.  We have to think not just about the composition of policies within our jurisdictions, but about the global composition that can maximise the effects of monetary policy so that our respective mandates can best be delivered without overburdening further monetary policy, and so as to limit any destabilising spillovers. This is not a preference or a choice. It is simply the new reality we face.       [1]Inflation as a global phenomenon has been documented e.g. by M. Ciccarelli and B.

      "['2016-06-23', 'Yves Mersch', 'Monetary policy in the euro area: scope, principles and limits', 'Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Natixis Meeting of Chief Economists, Paris, 23 June 2016', '  Monetary policy in the euro area: scope, principles and limits   Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Natixis Meeting of Chief Economists, Paris, 23 June 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, The past few years, not to speak of present days, have been challenging ones for central banks worldwide, and the euro area has been no exception. The ECB’s monetary policy decisions have come under greater scrutiny than ever before. Some commentators have argued that the ECB does not have sufficient tools to counter deflationary pressures in the euro area. Others contend that by using a wider range of instruments than in normal times, the ECB has exceeded its remit. Neither view is correct. Our Statute allows us to use a wide range of tools to meet our mandate, and those tools are sufficient for that purpose.  But it is correct that there are limits on how far monetary policy can go. The ECB cannot, will not, and need not exceed these limits. Our framework requires that unconventional tools are used for no longer than necessary, and no more intensively than necessary. Within these limits we independently decide on how best to comply with our price stability mandate. Today, all major central banks have clear price stability mandates and can discharge them with a large measure of independence. In the ECB’s case, our price stability mandate is enshrined in the Treaty,[1] and we have been given ‘instrument’ independence in how we carry it out. We cannot decide whether we achieve our objective – we have to obey the law – but we can decide how we do so.  This position has been confirmed by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that the ECB can deploy any available instrument which is explicitly mentioned in the Statute to ensure price stability. But the discretion we have over how we use our instruments, though wide, is not unlimited “whatever it takes” is qualified by “within our mandate”. Independence must not be confused with arbitrariness.  The Treaties also set out a number of restrictions and principles that guide our monetary policy. There are three in particular that stand out. First is the prohibition on monetary financing laid down in Article 123, which prevents the central bank from taking actions which would directly finance government spending. We are prohibited from monetary financing for good reasons. If a central bank systematically finances government budgets, it can fall prey to so-called “fiscal dominance” and fail its price stability mandate. That is because, when inflation starts to rise, the central bank is in a lose-lose situation: it can either continue financing the deficit and risk overshooting its objective, or it can refuse to finance the deficit and risk a deflationary government default. But if the central bank is ex ante forbidden by law from monetary financing, the incentives are stronger for governments to run sound fiscal policies in the first place – and the independence of the central bank is preserved. “Monetary dominance” prevails over “fiscal dominance”. Fiscal soundness is an essential feature of a monetary union with a single monetary policy and national fiscal policies are necessary even if we were to achieve a fiscal union. What is more – and this is specific to the euro area – monetary financing could imply a redistribution of wealth among Member States, thus undermining the spirit of the “no bailout clause” (Art. 125 TFEU). If the central bank were to facilitate a regime of unsound fiscal policies and inflationary government deficits, it would inevitably expose itself to losses – either real losses through the inflation tax, or nominal losses through a reduction in the principal amounts it was owed. That would be tantamount to deliberate fiscal redistribution between different sets of taxpayers via the central bank’s balance sheet, which is not permissible in a monetary union that is not a fiscal union. In other words, the prohibition of monetary financing is the monetary counterpart of the “no bailout clause”. Second are the principles of judicial control: principle of conferral and principle of proportionality laid down in Article 5, which requires that our actions are limited to what is essential to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. Specifically, this means that our measures need to be suitable, necessary and proportionate\\xa0stricto sensu.[2] For an instrument to be\\xa0suitable, it needs to be able to address the respective risk to price stability. For an instrument to be\\xa0necessary, we must lack a viable alternative instrument. For an instrument to be\\xa0proportionate stricto sensu, its expected benefits should outweigh its costs. Third is the requirement to act according to the principle of an open market economy favouring an efficient allocation of resources.[3]  All monetary policy measures have allocative and distributive effects. Cutting interest rates, for example, has a redistributive impact on savers and borrowers, since it encourages borrowing and discourages saving. Moreover, in certain situations – for instance a panic-induced freeze in interbank markets – central bank intermediation may be critical to restore market functioning and support an efficient allocation of resources. But this must always be embedded in the understanding, which underpins the Treaty, that general markets distribute resources more efficiently than public authorities, and hence central bank actions should not blunt price signals or overwhelm market forces. Indeed, central banks should be marginal actors, steering marginal decisions, not resource allocation mechanisms. That has to be reflected in the design and implementation of our monetary policy tools. In the pre-crisis period, when we used conventional measures, i.e. interest rate policy, nobody had doubts that it was straightforward for us to respect these three operating principles set out in the Treaty:    By mainly implementing our policy through refinancing operations with commercial banks, we were not accused of monetary financing.  Our track record shows that raising and lowering rates was effective to maintain price stability.   And though all monetary policy, including interest rate policy, has allocative and distributive effects, those effects were contained and predictable.    Our recent monetary policy measures respect the law Since the onset of the crisis, however, we have had to adopt new, unconventional tools to fulfil our mandate – and this has naturally brought the question of the scope and limits of monetary policy more to the fore. Clearly, restricting ourselves only to the instruments used in normal times would have been a breach of our mandate. It could have had disastrous consequences for the euro area economy, and threatened our ability to achieve price stability. But that does not imply the reverse – i.e. that every conceivable tool would have been justified. In line with our mandate, we have used a broad range of our instrument independence to confront downside risks to inflation and achieve price stability. But equally, we have deployed only tools that are in line with our legal framework. And that has been possible because we have specifically designed our instruments so as not to exceed the three limits I outlined. Take our asset purchase programme (APP) – which includes both public and private sector bonds – as an example. First, the APP respects the prohibition on monetary financing, since we have placed a number of safeguards on our interventions.  We do not buy government bonds in the primary market, which is explicitly forbidden under Article 123. And neither do we act in the secondary market in a way which could be perceived as equivalent to acting in the primary market. The Eurosystem has put in place a blackout period, and so does not buy in periods around the date of a new issuance. Purchases are also subject to an issue share limit and an issuer limit. These limits ensure that we would not constitute a blocking minority for collective action clauses if such clauses were ever triggered. The European Court of Justice explicitly highlighted these limits when deciding upon the lawfulness of our actions. Second, it is proportionate, in the sense that it is both necessary and suitable to secure our price stability objective. As short-term interest rates move closer to their effective lower bound, it inevitably becomes harder for central banks to steer the economy by means of conventional policy. So if inflation is too low for too long – as is the risk in the euro area today – other tools become necessary. Two years ago, the Governing Council introduced several non-standard measures to unclog the transmission mechanism and avoid a credit crunch. We coined these measures “credit easing package”. In January last year, we finally opted for large-scale asset purchases when faced with a period of weak growth, when already low inflation rates were falling further and we saw risks of inflation expectations destabilising. Like our previous measures, these purchases belong to the category of credit easing. To fulfil our mandate we need to make use of all instruments at our disposal. The APP is a suitable tool because it acts directly on financing costs in the real economy. Rather than attempting to boost the economy only through the short end of the curve, it directly lowers yields at longer maturities, decreasing them by compressing the term premium, which in turn influences the cost of credit for firms and households. Third, we have designed the programme to limit distortions in relative prices which might have unwanted allocative and distributional consequences.  With our government bond purchases we “mirror the market”, which means that our interventions are spread across issuers from the various euro area countries on the basis of the ECB’s capital key. Together with the issuer limits, this ensures breathing space within and across markets for efficient price discovery. Indeed, even though yields are very low for certain sovereign issuers, issuers have been able to place new securities in the market in large volumes, which suggests that liquidity has not been materially affected by our actions.  Thus the most difficult part of our programme is our corporate bond purchases, since they extend into less liquid markets and increase the risk of distortions in relative prices – in particular between larger and smaller firms. But our activities cannot be evaluated in separation; they must be judged in a holistic manner. Indeed, up to now the decline in bank lending rates for small loans to euro area companies – which are mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – has been stronger than for large loans to bigger companies. This suggests that bank lending conditions have improved disproportionately for euro area SMEs since the announcement of our credit easing measures two years ago. As a result, fewer SMEs are reporting that credit has been a limiting factor for their businesses. This should only continue as our measures are fully rolled out and reach their maximum impact. In other words, the APP, coupled with our other credit easing measures, has reduced distortions caused by market fragmentation in the euro area.  Still, we know that the longer unconventional policy lasts, the greater the risk of distortions appearing and diminishing its effectiveness over time. The principle of proportionality also implies that we should only use such measures for as short a time as is necessary to fulfil our mandate. That is why, when the economy improves and inflation returns to our objective, we will have to reassess, adjust and ultimately phase out our purchase programmes and other non-standard measures. But the surest way to reach that point is to stay true to the course we are on now. If we were to change speed or direction too soon, it would only set back the recovery of inflation and delay the day that interest rate normalisation can happen. We will decide upon this in full independence, in the interests of price stability, impervious to the wishes of any interest group with any partial agenda.   Other policies can support the speed with which inflation returns to 2%  Can other policies help in this endeavour? In the inflationary days of the 1970s, some central bankers were so hesitant about the scope of their responsibility that they let price stability depend on others. For example, in the late 1970s the then Fed Chairman reported to the FOMC that “inflation is going to be left to the Federal Reserve and that’s going to be bad news. An effective program to reduce the rate of inflation has to extend beyond monetary policy and needs to be complemented by programs designed to enhance competition and to correct structural problems”. [4]\\xa0  But central banks have come a long way over the past half century. Today central banks take ownership of their mandates and we do not depend on others. For example, if we were to run into headwinds created by other policies, such as necessary fiscal consolidation, we could increase our policy stimulus to compensate. But if other policies undermined the effectiveness of our policy by disrupting or slowing down the monetary transmission mechanism, responding to that scenario would be more difficult. In such a situation we can only repeat that the support of other policies would speed up the return of inflation to 2%. But this must not be seen as a call for an ex ante policy mix with a monetisation of public debt or mutualisation of debt via Eurobonds under the present Treaty. This would mean giving up monetary dominance.  Rather, economic and institutional policies can help accelerate the impact of our measures. Structural reforms can reduce the transmission lag of our policy, since a more flexible, more responsive economy is likely to transmit monetary impulses faster. And institutional reforms can reduce uncertainty about the future setup of the euro area, which weighs on expectations and holds back investment. Indeed, as we can see increasingly in Europe today, strengthening confidence in the future trajectory of our Union is perhaps the most decisive contribution we could make to growth.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Eurosystem has broad discretion over the tools it can use to deliver its primary objective of price stability. That objective guides the decision on which tools to use, and when to use them, and defines the boundaries set out in our legal framework. The use of additional tools in recent times reflects the ECB’s commitment to delivering its mandate. Such tools have been suitable to achieve our objectives and have been necessary to combat deflationary headwinds. Still, we are aware that – while justified – our latest non-standard measures are on a significant scale. This is why our non-standard measures cannot last forever.

      "['2016-06-21', 'Mario Draghi', 'Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament', 'Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 21 June 2016', '  Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament   Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 21 June 2016 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to be back speaking to your committee for the second hearing of this year.  Let me first say that the ECB takes note of today’s judgement of the Federal German Constitutional Court. This judgement confirms the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union which concluded that the OMT programme is compatible with EU law and falls within our mandate. In my remarks today, I will review the state of the euro area recovery and the recent monetary policy measures adopted by the ECB. Then, at the request of this committee, I will discuss the investment outlook, outlining in particular why more action is needed to boost investment demand in the euro area.  Economic outlook and the ECB’s monetary policy As regards economic developments, the recovery of the euro area economy gained momentum at the start of the year. It is expected to proceed at a moderate but steady pace, supported by solid domestic demand and the effective pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. Consumers are benefiting from still relatively low oil prices and improved employment prospects. Likewise, investment is edging up, supported by higher corporate profits and favourable financing conditions. Looking forwards, according to the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, annual real GDP is expected to increase by 1.6% this year and by 1.7% in the next two years.  At the same time, inflation dynamics in the euro area remain rather subdued. The rate of headline inflation was slightly negative in May and is expected to hover at low levels over the coming months. While lower oil prices continue to act as a drag on the annual headline inflation, domestic price pressures, notably from wage growth, also remain muted, reflecting persistent economic slack. According to the Eurosystem staff projections, inflation should pick up towards the end of 2016. Thereafter, inflation is expected to increase further to 1.3% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018, as a strengthening economic recovery mobilises unused resources. Since the start of our credit easing measures in June 2014, bank lending rates for firms and households have fallen by about 90 and 80 basis points respectively, reaching historical lows in April 2016. The growth rate of bank credit to euro area corporations turned positive in 2015. At the same time, other sources of external finance – the net issuance of debt securities and shares by non-financial corporations – have benefited from more favourable capital market conditions, improving corporate profits and increasing retained earnings. The easing is especially felt by small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), which are heavily reliant on bank credit. In our recent Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area, SMEs continued to report a further improvement in their access to credit and an increased willingness of banks to provide credit at lower interest rates.\\xa0New bank credit to companies is increasingly being used to finance investment projects.  Further monetary policy stimulus is in the pipeline. We started our corporate bond purchases earlier this month as part of our asset purchase programme. The programme has started smoothly, with ample purchase volumes. Since the start of 2016, and even more evidently since the corporate bond purchase programme was announced in March, borrowing conditions for companies with direct access to the bond market have improved materially. For example, over the first half of 2016 the cost of market-based debt for euro area non-financial corporations has declined by around 75 basis points. We expect more firms, including mid-sized companies, to be able to access this source of external finance over the near future as the market for companies’ debt expands and deepens. Tomorrow we will start conducting the first operation of our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II). TLTRO II will allow banks to secure long-term funding at very attractive conditions that can be as low as the deposit facility rate. This should further ease the borrowing costs of the private sector and provide an additional impulse to credit creation.  Overall, our measures have been instrumental in putting the recovery on a more solid footing and thereby securing the conditions for inflation to rise towards levels closer to 2% over a not-too-distant horizon. They have underpinned the revival in the consumption of durable goods which we have observed since 2014, and are finally showing through in a more robust pick-up in non-construction investment.  Without our policy stimulus, both growth and inflation would be significantly lower. Our March package, in particular, has mitigated the downside risks to the euro area economic outlook. Additional impetus will come from the measures that are still at an early stage of implementation.  At the same time, uncertainty remains high and downside risks are still significant due to the continued fragile state of the global economy and geopolitical developments.  We will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK’s EU referendum.  Investment in the euro area After the sharp downturn observed during the financial crisis in 2008 and the renewed decline during the European sovereign debt crisis, real investment in the euro area has now begun to recover. In particular, business investment has undergone a welcome recovery since 2013 and public and housing investment have recently broadly stabilised.  Despite these positive trends, the current level of investment is still unsatisfactory. The level of total real investment in the euro area remains more than 10% below pre-crisis levels. Therefore, further action is needed, including at EU level. The Investment Plan for Europe is a welcome example. While we would support extending it beyond 2018, the success of the current plan also rests on its capacity to improve the investment environment, at both European and national level. Only reforms in this area can guarantee its long-term effects. At EU level – and here the European Parliament has an important role to play as co-legislator – we should further deepen the Single Market, notably in the areas of energy, transport and the digital economy. We should also make full use of the potential of existing Single Market legislation by ensuring its complete and consistent enforcement. Strengthening the European dimension of regulatory enforcement would help to lessen complexity, enhance the level playing field and reduce the fragmentation of product markets.  In addition, we should act decisively to make the channelling of savings into productive investment more efficient. The banking union, including the ECB in its micro- and macroprudential role, has an important role to play in ensuring that banking markets efficiently allocate resources to the most productive investment opportunities across the euro area.  Progress on the capital markets union is also essential to develop a favourable environment for productive investment in the EU. It will help diversify the sources of funding needed to spur investment – notably for SMEs and long-term projects – by complementing bank financing with deeper, more developed capital markets. The legislative acts regarding simple, transparent and standardised securitisation you are discussing are tangible examples of how EU legislation can broaden financing opportunities for EU companies, foster cross-border investment and ultimately have a positive impact on the EU investment outlook. At national level, reforms to improve business framework conditions and reduce regulatory and administrative bottlenecks also need to be further pursued. It is the whole institutional framework that helps to transform financial resources into productive investments, which, in turn, increase productivity and, ultimately, create jobs. Inefficient public procurement, taxation systems, judicial systems and insolvency frameworks, identified in some countries, need to be fully addressed. Country-specific recommendations can be a powerful tool to identify and address barriers to investment in individual countries.  Moreover, those countries where public finances allow, should undertake public investment in areas conducive to growth. Regarding other countries, let me mention that long-term investment benefits from stability-oriented macroeconomic policies. Finally, investors need certainty regarding the economic and institutional environment in which they will operate. This is also one of the reasons why, almost one year ago, the Five Presidents’ Report set out a plan for strengthening Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).   Conclusions Allow me to conclude.  Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Nevertheless, for this recovery to be consolidated, our efforts should now concentrate on strong policy action to improve the business environment, favour investment and raise productivity. Delivering on these objectives will not only create the conditions for inflation to accelerate its return to levels below, but close to, 2%. It will also make a major contribution to improving the standard of living of the people of Europe.  Citizens and markets need to be sure about our capacity to take on the common challenges we face. Our focus should be on making our common home, Europe, stronger. Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.

This two-day conference is dedicated to the memory of Niall Merriman, Head of the ECB’s Financial Reporting and Policy Division, who unexpectedly passed away in September 2015.  A special welcome and thank you to the distinguished speakers for sharing their thoughts on the topics covered today and tomorrow.  This conference is by now well established, as demonstrated by the great interest among central banks around the globe, and the ever increasing participation.    The conference is organised along four main themes:  Developments in international accounting standards;  Impact of accounting on financial regulation and supervisory reporting;  Managing risks on central bank balance sheets; and  Governance and financial reporting issues at central banks.  On the first topic, the ECB has stepped up its efforts in monitoring international accounting developments over the last two years. There are two reasons underlying this.  First, as you certainly remember, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) became operational in November 2014. Accounting information forms the basis for various elements of prudential regulation and supervision. As already highlighted in an ECB report published in December 2006, a harmonised and comparable accounting framework is an important element for consistent supervision.[1] After the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008, the G20 called for a single set of high quality global accounting standards in order to strengthen credibility and comparability of financial information. The main aim of this request was to alleviate risks in the financial sector and to help prevent future financial crises. Therefore, the ECB supports the recent activities of the IASB which are geared towards achieving this objective.  Second, the ECB has recently become more directly involved in the European process for adopting the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is a major consequence of the Maystadt report on how to reinforce the EU’s contribution to the IFRS Standards and improve the governance of the European institutions developing these standards.[2] Since January 2015, the ECB has an observer status in both the new Board of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the related Technical Expert Group (TEG). The EFRAG is a private association that provides technical advice to the European Commission on the endorsement of IFRS Standards, as well as related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). The ECB also participates in a number of other committees dealing with IFRS Standards, such as the IFRS Advisory Council, the Accounting Expert Group of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Accounting Subgroup of the European Banking Authority. Our aim is to ensure that coordinated positions of the ECB on relevant accounting matters are duly considered in the accounting standard-setting process. The colleagues in session one will provide insights into the current challenges in relation to international accounting standard-setting, the role of international accounting standards in the EU as well as their formal adoption and implementation in the Single Market.  With respect to the second topic, the impact of accounting on financial regulation and supervisory reporting, I have already touched upon the mounting relevance of the interaction between international accounting standards and prudential regulation and supervision following the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. I will confine myself to a few remarks on two related matters:   the issue of non-performing exposures (NPEs);[3] and  the regulatory guidance on the new expected credit loss model and its interaction with prudential capital requirements.  The year 2015 was the first full operational year of the SSM. One of the first items on the SSM’s task list was to follow up on the results of the 2014 comprehensive assessment. The comprehensive assessment helped us to identify problems on the balance sheets of the significant banks. One of the important outcomes was the scale of NPEs now classified using a harmonised definition. As you are aware, some euro area banks still have high levels of NPEs on their balance sheets.  In the euro area, the average ratio of NPEs for significant institutions stood at 7.1% at the end of 2015, which is high by international standards.[4] For instance, a proxy for the ratio of NPEs in the US has continued to decline in recent years and amounts to only 1.5% at the end of 2015. A comprehensive policy response to the high levels of NPEs in Europe is necessary, and as part of that, the SSM is working to take stock of supervisory best practices. More action is needed to address shortcomings in insolvency, collateral and taxation frameworks.  Accounting standards are also important to address the issue. In the US, accounting standards require US banks to reduce, after six months, their NPEs to the market value of their collateral, if any. Balance sheets are therefore cleaned up of bad loans rather swiftly. This illustrates how accounting standards interact with supervisory concerns. Until now, the incurred loss model has been applied under IFRS which does not impose a timely treatment of NPEs by the banks. As a consequence, NPEs accumulate in banks’ balance sheets, consuming capital and not contributing to banks’ profitability. The introduction of IFRS 9 as from 2018 will change this situation. The ECB has already publicly expressed its support for a swift endorsement of IFRS 9. In our view, the new requirements for the classification, measurement and impairment of financial instruments, as well as the new general hedge accounting model, constitute an improvement over the previous requirements in IAS 39. Moreover, we believe that some aspects of the new standard may be an improvement from a financial stability perspective. The merits of the new expected credit loss model will clearly depend on its proper and consistent implementation in the financial sector. In this perspective, it is important that more granular instructions are given by the standard-setters and regulatory authorities in order to ensure that the implementation of the new standard is not subject to different interpretations that would not respect a proper level playing field. At the same time, it will be crucial to monitor the application of IFRS 9 in order to ensure that there are no unintended cyclical consequences of its implementation.  In the US, the FASB just announced the approval of similar standards that nevertheless will only start to be applied in 2020. US banks have been critical of what will be a major change in frontloading provisions for credit risk. The introduction of both new standards will be a substantial change that will affect banks, already subject to more demanding regulation to which new features will continue to be added until year-end, albeit with the promise of not leading to a “significant increase in capital requirements”, as stated by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS).  In this same vein, regulators should monitor carefully the consequences of the new standards and, if need be, should consider an appropriate transition period from a prudential point of view. One must not forget the interaction of the new accounting rules under IFRS 9 and the solvency requirements for banks. The Basel Committee is currently doing some work in this area, to which the ECB contributes on an ongoing basis.  Against this background, the ECB also welcomes the Basel Committee’s supervisory guidance on sound credit risk practices and the application of accounting impairment models based on expected credit losses.[5] European banks will need to consider any possible impact of this guidance on their plans for the implementation of IFRS 9. Hence, we are confident that the guidance will achieve its stated objective and contribute to a consistent implementation of the expected credit loss model across European banks. The second day of this conference will be devoted to “traditional” central bank topics – risk management and governance. Proper risk management remains high on the agenda of central banks and is therefore the “guiding theme” of session three. Due to extraordinary circumstances, such as persisting low inflation and its potential effect on investment behaviour, central banks worldwide have been forced to take extraordinary measures. For example, in the last year and in an attempt to secure a return of inflation to levels closer to 2% over the medium term, the Governing Council decided to expand its asset purchase programme. Under this programme, the target level for the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector securities is now €80 billion.  All these measures have and will continue to transform central bank balance sheets. In particular, central bank balance sheets have been expanded considerably which requires risk managers to pay special attention to possible medium- and long-term risks. For this reason, risk management is becoming an even more critical component of the ECB’s and other central banks’ daily activities.  Against this background, I am happy to welcome speakers from around the globe that will provide first-hand information about these extraordinary measures and how they may affect risk exposures and risk management of central banks worldwide.   Session four is dedicated to “governance and financial reporting issues at central banks”. Discussions about the credibility of central banks have intensified over the last couple of years. I will leave it to the speakers tomorrow to highlight the latest developments in these areas. I will just describe some specific elements of our recent internal reorganisation at the ECB which are geared towards improving the quality of our governance function.  Firstly, the ECB has created a new position in 2015, the Chief Services Officer (CSO), responsible for matters pertaining to administrative services, IT services, human resources and finance. Secondly, the Executive Board of the ECB decided to create an independent Finance department, reporting to the CSO and responsible for budgeting and controlling, financial and cost accounting, financial reporting and procurement. Finally, also in 2015, the ECB decided to establish a dedicated Compliance and Governance Office (CGO) as a key risk management control function to strengthen the ECB’s governance framework. The purpose of this Office is to support the Executive Board in protecting the integrity and reputation of the ECB, to promote ethical standards of behaviour and to strengthen the ECB’s accountability and transparency. To this end, the new CGO performs activities relating to the ECB’s revised ethics framework and other governance activities.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the four sessions of today and tomorrow provide a representative sample of current key topics and challenges for central banks worldwide. I therefore wish you a productive and inspiring conference.     [1]ECB (2006), Assessment of accounting standards from a financial stability perspective    [2]Maystadt, P.

Hospitality is becoming increasingly important in a world which is growing ever closer together. That includes offering hospitality to people from other countries and cultures. But it is precisely this type of hospitality that some people find difficult. Allow me to quote from a French cultural icon – not from Proust or Flaubert – but from an Asterix adventure. In the story, an innkeeper from the town of Orange moves with his family to the small Gallic village where Asterix lives. This prompts Geriatrix, the oldest inhabitant there, to say: “You know me, I’ve got nothing against foreigners, some of my best friends are foreigners, but these particular foreigners aren’t from this village!”. This story was published in 1974, but the sentiment is alarmingly familiar. Fear of purported foreigners prevents many people from showing hospitality – it’s the same today as it was forty or a hundred years ago. But are people from different backgrounds and cultures really so foreign? Are they really different from us? I don’t think so. It is precisely art and culture that show us this so clearly. All over the world, people are making music, painting pictures, telling stories and performing plays. And fundamentally it is always the same feelings that are being expressed: joy, sorrow, anger, love, hope. Whatever the medium of expression may be, at heart the message is the same. Art and culture teach us much about others and much about ourselves – but above all they show us how much we all have in common. The goal and the merit of the ECB’s European Cultural Days is to showcase these similarities and at the same time promote understanding of the differences. The focus on culture is indeed in the spirit of a great European – Jean Monnet. He reportedly said: “If I had a chance to start the construction of Europe again, I would start with culture”. Jean Monnet was convinced that Europe belongs together. He was convinced that it has to, and that it can, belong together. I share this conviction. And your support, ladies and gentlemen, for the ECB’s Cultural Days shows me that you too share this conviction. This year’s series of cultural events will also help to make Europe grow a little closer together. You are all making an important contribution to that, and I warmly thank you on behalf of the ECB. Looking back, we also wish to thank Malta, which delighted us with a great programme last year. Malta is a first-class example of how different cultures can come together and forge something new. A distinct culture has, over time, emerged from Carthaginian, Phoenician, Roman, French and British influences. Thinking very long term, I see it as providing inspiration for a united Europe. However, we don’t have to look quite so far into the future for the Cultural Days 2016. Our thanks go to the Deutsche Bundesbank, with whom the ECB is jointly organising the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS this year. Andreas Dombret will give us a brief overview of the highlights of the programme shortly. As for myself, I would like to conclude by referring to another European, who was born in Dublin, lived in London and died in Paris: Oscar Wilde. His view of culture was as down to earth as it was comprehensible. He said: “Culture depends on cookery”. In that respect, this evening is an additional cultural reward for us all.  ']\n",
      "['2016-06-17', 'Mario Draghi', 'Laudatio for Theo Waigel', 'Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, <br>in honour of Dr. Theodor Waigel at SignsAwards in Munich, 17 June 2016', '  Laudatio for Theo Waigel   Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, in honour of Dr. Theodor Waigel at SignsAwards in Munich, 17 June 2016 James Freeman Clarke, a 19th century theologian, once observed that “a politician is a man who thinks of the next election, while a statesman thinks of the next generation”. This captures well why we are here to honour Theo Waigel today.  Theo Waigel’s political career cannot just be defined by the elections he won, however many there were during his 30 years in the Bundestag. Nor can it be defined by his time as head of the CSU and as finance minister of Germany.  It is defined by his legacy: a legacy that is still shaping Europe today. He became finance minister in 1989 at a turning-point in post-war European history – when the Iron Curtain that divided Europe was being lifted; when the walls and barbed wire that divided Germany were being removed.  It was a time of great hopes and expectations. But it was also a time of some anxiety. It was clear that the successful reunification of Germany would be a tremendous undertaking. And many wondered what those changes would mean for the European Community – whether it would upset the balance of power that had prevailed between nations since the war. In that uncertain setting, Theo Waigel’s leadership was pivotal – both as a German and as a European.  He was one of the strongest advocates of German reunification, and was instrumental in getting Germany’s federal and state governments to finance the reconstruction and modernisation of East Germany. And under his influence, the German government took a fundamental decision for Europe: that the reunification which made Germany stronger should not make Europe weaker. Free of the threat of the Soviet Union, Germany chose not to go down a path of its own making.  Instead, it renewed its commitment to Europe. And it demonstrated the strength of that commitment by sharing its currency with its neighbours. As Theo Waigel said, Germany brought the Deutsche Mark to Europe, and in doing so brought the euro into being.  This historic sequence of events spoke to three character traits which define Theo Waigel: his vision, his resolve and his statesmanship.  He was a person who took the long view and followed his convictions rather than the zeitgeist. He was not discouraged by the obstacles that stood in his way, however high they were. And he had that crucial quality of all great statesmen – the ability to take others with him.  He brought these same three qualities to bear in the design of Economic and Monetary Union some years later. His voice carried particular weight in the decision to add the Stability and Growth Pact to the architecture of monetary union. Against considerable resistance in some corners, his advocacy ensured the euro was born within a framework for fiscal discipline.  This was visionary, because the Pact was more than just a set of rules. What Theo Waigel understood is that a union of separate nations, with different histories, traditions and cultures, but bound together by common interests and common needs, could only be built on mutual trust.  Trust was the key ingredient for countries take further steps towards integration without fear of moral hazard. But trust had to be earned. First, by countries showing that they accepted the shared responsibilities that monetary union creates. And second, by converging towards similar levels of income, which would assuage fears of a future “transfer union”. Theo Waigel’s insight was to see that the Stability Pact could achieve both. Responsibility would be demonstrated by compliance with the rules that had been agreed by all. And compliance would lead to greater stability, higher growth and ultimately faster convergence. When the Pact was agreed in the late 1990s, it was in a climate of optimism and prudence where this expectation seemed feasible. Fiscal discipline had spread through the euro area as countries prepared for membership. And the addition of the single currency to the single market was expected to lead to a rapid narrowing of differences between richer and poorer members.  But the reality was of course different, and convergence was slower than we thought – at least sustainable convergence that did not unwind with the bust. This was in part due to a lack of conviction among euro area countries that compliance with the rules would generate jobs and growth. It was in part due to a lack of determination in applying those rules. And it was in part due to external factors, namely the global financial crisis. Fundamentally, the culture that should have underpinned trust – of responsibility leading to solidarity – needed to be stronger. And without that, as Theo Waigel foresaw, our monetary union was more fragile than it should have been.  So today we face a choice – between leaving things as they are and moving forward. And this is not a choice without costs.  We have seen that the price of inaction is high. We have seen how it leaves the economy vulnerable to instability. We have seen how the perceived impotence of public authorities in meeting the needs of their people feeds into frustration and rejection. And we have seen how that risks undermining trust in and support for our institutions – and even the European Union itself. So to my mind there is only one way ahead, and that is to complete the vision that Theo Waigel left us. But progress today must be different from the past. We have to find a new way to build trust among the Member States and the peoples of Europe – a way that builds on existing institutions to better ensure that the common needs of the people are met. The needs that we share in common, and that can be more safely delivered in common, must be identified and explained more clearly.  They include economic interests, such as the benefits provided by a large and fully integrated financial area. They include defence, and more generally security against internal and external threats, the capacity to address global migration challenges and the protection of intellectual property – all of which the European Union helps deliver, in ways that individual governments may not necessarily be able to do. And they include environmental protection and the fight against climate change. It is the demonstration of why, and how, those interests can be better protected in common that will gradually complement compliance and convergence as the basis for trust and the cement of the Union. And I think that in many cases the evidence is already there for all to see. But to move forward, and I believe it is in our interests to do so, will require us to draw on the qualities that made Theo Waigel a leader. His focus on the long horizon rather than the demands of the day.  His courage in his convictions and his resilience in seeing them through.  And above all his mastery at convincing and building consensus. That would be the best way to honour Theo Waigel’s legacy, and to deliver the stability and prosperity that our Union was built for.

      "['2008-09-05', 'Jean-Claude Trichet', 'Risk and the Macro-economy', 'Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the conference ‘The ECB and its Watchers X’Frankfurt am Main, 5 September 2008', '  Risk and the Macro-economy   Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the conference ‘The ECB and its Watchers X’Frankfurt am Main, 5 September 2008 Ladies and gentlemen, After an extended period of ample financial market liquidity and exceptionally low rewards for risk, the loss in the value of important classes of real assets has imparted a sharp deterioration in investor appetite. Rises in commodity prices, by eroding consumers’ purchasing power and real income prospects, have reinforced households’ risk aversion.  A long phase of heightened risk tolerance in our economies has come to an end. To the extent that the more recent turns in the markets correct past excesses, this is a welcome – if painful – process that we had anticipated and asked market participants to prepare for in past interventions.  At the same time, the decline in the compensation for risk that the recent turmoil has partly reversed is not a recent development. It started a quarter of a century ago, in tandem with – and probably reflecting – what seems to have been a persistent decline in macroeconomic uncertainty. So, to the extent that this moderation in macroeconomic fluctuations – in aggregate risk – would be confirmed as a permanent acquisition of modern economies, there is some reason to believe that the trend to lower risk valuations – beyond the needed corrections of the more recent excesses – could in the end reassert itself.  In this talk I will reflect upon some evidence that lies at the heart of the mechanisms through which risk valuation makes contact with real economic decisions. The ultimate aim of my reflections is to find hints about the fundamental value of risk.  Theories, for which I have some sympathy, have it that there is a historical break in risk valuation in the markets, and the realisation of that break largely mirrors structural developments in the balance between savings and investment on a global scale. China’s phenomenal growth in domestic manufacturing capacity and income production was not matched by an equi-proportional growth in domestic spending capacity – so Chinese savings grew ahead of even the dramatic pace at which domestic investment has expanded. At the same time, the aftermaths of the East Asian crisis brought about an “investment strike” in many economies bordering on the Asian Pacific, and taught authorities in those countries that bigger liquidity buffers – denominated in safe Western currencies – were needed to defend themselves against the volatile behaviour of foreign private investors. Finally, international financial markets were called upon – once again – to recycle the massive hard-currency balances that were being accumulated by commodity exporting countries. All this has made saving – and wealth – abundant ex ante relative to investment and income. And has led to a downside adjustment in the rewards that investors can claim to receive in compensation for their finance.  These developments at time have dominated the financial landscape. But the breaks in the evolution of the market rewards for risk on which I will focus date long before the rise of the Asian economies and the increase in commodity prices. So, I will search for a fundamental connection between financial risk and macroeconomic performance in the developed countries, which will be the focus of my remarks. What is the direction of this link? Does the Great Moderation determine the quantum of risk traded in the markets? Or does the price of risk determined in the financial markets contribute and partly determine those fluctuations? And what is structural in this link – and thus likely to persist beyond short-term volatilities – and what is transient?  A complete understanding of these relations would bring invaluable insights for policy considerations. For one thing, the centrepiece of dynamic macroeconomics is the equation of savings to investment. Asset prices – and the risk remuneration that they embody – are the mechanisms that do all this equating. Therefore, sustained movements in risk premia of the size that we have seen in the past quarter of a century are bound to have important implications for the allocation of consumption and investment across times and states of nature, and for the determination of aggregate demand at any point in time and in any economic state. I will also mention new – to some extent unknown – forms of interactions between financial markets and the real economy.  One possibility that many observers have contemplated is that the prices determined in the market for key factors of production – such as energy or other commodities – might be increasingly influenced by forces and trading strategies that are motivated by the financial drive toward portfolio diversification, beside the desire to secure access to a physical delivery. Again, the way these markets might be pricing financial risk might make the interpretation of those prices more difficult.  Unfortunately, my conclusion is that the state of our knowledge is not advanced enough to draw definitive conclusions about the nature and the directions of influences between risk pricing and the macro-economy. I will nevertheless submit my conjectures and lay out some basic behavioural principles that could help policymakers minimise major losses amid the uncertainty surrounding the current economic juncture.  I also appeal to the many distinguished scholars that sit in front of me today to concentrate their minds to elucidate these relations.       1. Risk premia and macroeconomic conditions    There is no univocal way to assess whether asset values are high or low relative to economic norms. Popular commentary often focuses on price indices and how they deviate from long-term averages. But, of course, index levels can vary because of general price inflation, or growth in the real economy, or changes in the size of publicly traded assets relative to the economy. So, it is customary for analysts to scale asset prices in various ways.  A summary statistic of valuations that abstracts from scaling problems is the “asset risk premium”, or the rate of excess return investors expect to earn over the long run from their investment at current prices. [1] If the asset generates uncertain payoffs, investors ask to be compensated for this risk, which they would not bear if they chose to hold a competiting security with comparatively more predictable returns. The risk premium represents this reward. For a given stream of expected cash flows, a higher risk premium today signals a diminished willingness to hold the risky asset or, equivalently, a higher required return for doing so. Higher returns can be generated only by future price appreciation from a lower current price. So, an increase in the premium today is associated with a capital loss in the form of a drop in the current price of the asset. Conversely, a low premium signals a high current price relative to the expected income stream discounted at the risk-free rate. The risk premium measures the attractiveness of a risky investment relative to risk-free alternatives. Indirectly, it is a measure of the market’s appetite for investment risk.  These figures [Figures 1a, 2a and 3] document the basic facts that constitute the subject of my considerations on the risk and the macro-economy. I focus here on estimates of the risk premia paid on four important asset classes: equity, houses, government bonds and corporate credit securities. They span the four markets for external finance that are most critical to the functioning of modern economies: the market for capital, installed in businesses and in residential establishments, and the market for credit, to government and corporate borrowers. I use US and euro area observations, whenever these are available, but international evidence broadly confirms this picture. And I concentrate on the last quarter of a century when the movements which I shall reflect upon are most evident.  What do we see in these pictures? Two things: First, if I emphasise trends rather than waves, I see that risk premia on a representative spectrum of assets have declined more or less consistently since the middle of the 1980s. This is another way to say that the market price of those assets has tended to appreciate relative to the stream of their expected payoffs, discounted at the risk-free rate. Second, looking at higher-frequency movements around trends, I notice a turnaround in some financial series toward the end of the period. In particular, equity and credit financing has become more costly for firms to obtain, as the risk premia required for holding stocks and credit securities have recently bounced back from the lows achieved earlier. The upswing in the equity risk premium came first. The violent reversal in the credit risk premia is even more recent history. Understanding these trends and co-movements is an important pre-condition for any inference we need to draw on the more recent turnarounds. So, I shall concentrate on low-frequency movements first, and come back to my interpretation of the turnarounds and the future at the end of my talk. Why have required excess returns – risk premia – on, say, stocks trended down? Many explanations specific to the market for business capital are conceivable. One is that expectations of future cash-flows in the form of dividend payments might have consistently lagged behind ex post realisations, which in the end drive stock prices. [2] For example, the potential for sustained economic growth in excess of historical precedents, the availability of profitable investment projects beyond the frontier that was considered attainable ex ante might explain a fraction of the decline in required stock returns over a certain phase. Why have term premia on bonds trended down? Again, specific factors affecting the market for safe financial investments have been cited. I have mentioned already that the rapid expansion of incomes in countries with high propensities to save meant that a large share of their increased demand for assets was directed to the risk-free financial liabilities of primary sovereign issuers, most prominently the US Treasury.  Similarly, trends in the market for homes and for private credit can be given explanations rooted in housing preferences and the evolution of default rates through time.  But there is one question which remains, beyond all these explanations. [3] They all are too specific to one market. As we see, declines in returns have been generalised. Estimated premia in the stock market in 2008 lie one third and two thirds below their values at the beginning of the 1980s, in the euro area and the US respectively. In the meantime, term premia on the bond market have lost three fourth of their estimated value at the middle of the 1990s in a seemingly relentless fall spanning the entire period for which we could compute them. The premium for investments in houses has followed a similar trend, despite a sharp reversion, in particular in the US in the most recent period. Finally, the cost of corporate borrowing in excess of a riskless rate [Figure 3], which remunerates credit risk, has also decreased significantly in both economies, although its trend is punctuated by significant oscillations in the opposite direction. Obviously we observe the same movements across the board.  Facts common to multiple markets suggest the existence of a common factor, something truly related to the size of the required premium for holding all types of risky assets. If the compensation for bearing risk is compressed in all markets, this must reflect that either the quantity of macroeconomic risk has gone down, or the price at which investors trade that risk has declined, or some combination of these two possibilities.  In these two further pictures [Figures 1b and 2b], the quantity of aggregate risk is proxied by the macroeconomic uncertainty introduced by the volatility of real per-capita consumption growth [– as measured by rolling standard deviations of per-capita real consumption growth –] and the level of inflation in the two economies. [4] Unfortunately, the price that markets attach to that quantity – agents’ risk aversion – is not directly observable or easily approximated by observable variables. I shall come back to this point later. Why concentrate on consumption volatility as a proxy of real macroeconomic uncertainty? Because this is the privileged statistic of macroeconomic conditions in consumption-based asset pricing models, the standard tool of financial economics. In these models, it is the marginal utility of consumption and its variance that should help price real payoffs in different states of nature. [5] Why focus on inflation as an indicator of nominal uncertainty? If the level of inflation is correlated with its perceived variability, then the level of inflation should influence people’s views of the degree of uncertainty that surrounds their macroeconomic environments. If the nominal scale of the economy is more firmly secured, financial markets will likely reflect it in lower premia. The drawn-out moderation in real macroeconomic volatilities – the Great Moderation – is a well-known fact. It has been persistent, as the pictures indicate, and broad, spreading beyond inflation and consumption to virtually all sectors and components of income, on a global scale, as many studies have demonstrated. [6] The tight correlation between the risk premia priced in various markets and movements in macroeconomic risk is less known, however. It is certainly of great interest to policymakers. [7]  It is a challenging piece of evidence for two reasons. Because causation can run both ways, from macroeconomic volatility – the quantum of non-diversifiable risk – to risk compensation in the financial markets, or from the market determination of the reward for risk – the market price of risk – back to the macroeconomic equilibrium. And because both chains of causation entail a blend of structural and contingent factors: factors that are likely to last and factors that are transient and bound to be reversed.  Therefore, in September 2008 a scholar, a forecaster, a policymaker looking back to the financial history of the last quarter of a century for clues about the proximate future evolutions faces two questions. First, what determined the compression of risk in virtually all markets: was it a reduction in aggregate risk, or was it a compression in the price for which markets trade and distribute that risk? Second, whatever the cause, did the compression of risk reflect permanent shifts in fundamental connections, or was it transient?  A lot – not least in terms of policy decisions – is conditional on a clear identification of these links, of these directions and their nature.      1.1 The quantum of risk: what is structural and what is transient?    Staring at the statistical association between premia and macroeconomic volatilities it would be tempting to draw a line of causation running from declining macroeconomic risk to falling premia. The decrease in macroeconomic uncertainty associated with the fall in the volatilities of consumption and inflation can arguably be expected to have resulted in a corresponding reduction in the uncertainty on future asset returns, thus leading to lower risk premia across the board. In the case of government bonds, for example, a decrease in macroeconomic volatility reduces the risk of unexpected future changes in interest rates – perhaps policy-induced – and removes one primary source of return uncertainty that investors in bonds have to hedge against in less tranquil times. [8] For corporate bonds and commercial paper, a decrease in the amplitude of business-cycle fluctuations should bring about, ceteris paribus, a lower probability of default, which, once again, can translate into lower credit risk premia. Analogous reasoning holds for stock and housing markets, with the fall in macroeconomic volatility translating into a decrease in the uncertainty about expected future returns, and therefore leading to lower risk premia. However, even if one is prepared to entertain the possibility that the line of causation runs predominantly from macroeconomic conditions – fundamental macroeconomic stability – to asset price determination, the prospects for the evolution of market prices in the near future are vastly conditional on the nature of the macroeconomic moderation.  If one believes that the main reason for the observed decline in macroeconomic volatilities – and, indirectly, for low risk compensations and high prices in asset markets – is that policy regimes have become more stable, more predictable and confidence-inspiring, then prospects for market participants and policymakers alike will be brighter. We all know that the institutional roots of the Great Moderation are significant, as studies done at the ECB and elsewhere have shown. [9] We know that policy statutes – disciplining monetary policy and the fiscal authority – have been carefully crafted in many countries to make sure that stable policy conditions are put in place and are there to last. So, if all this is true, one could perhaps confidently extrapolate the moderate macroeconomic volatilities of the past into the future. And, in so doing, one would equally be reassured that the down-trends in risk compensation that we have observed for so long – beyond short-run ups and downs – would not be reversed in a sustained manner.  But the same line of causation could be less reassuring from another angle. The same studies that have found an important role for policies in the Great Moderation of the last two decades cannot certainly rule out that “good luck” might have exerted a reinforcing influence. More moderate exogenous shocks might have contributed – more or less accidentally – to smoothing economic fluctuations. In the terms of our picture, this would be equivalent to say that the moderation in some non-policy factor driving activity might have been responsible for the fall in inflation and consumption variability. To the extent that this interpretation has some merit, a less fortunate string of shocks could always bring more ample swings in economic conditions – looking forward – than we have grown accustomed to from past experience. And this could entail repercussions for the valuation of investment risk in various financial markets. In this case a return to historical valuations for risk would imply large negative returns for a possibly extended period of time.       1.2 The price of risk: what is structural and what is transient?    It is important to understand that the close co-movements that appear when comparing trends in premia with trends in macro-volatilities are not inconsistent with an alternative, inverse pattern of causation: one predominantly running from financial market prices to the macro-economy.  Exogenous changes in financial markets may have caused an original fall in risk premia. Since asset prices provide signals for profitable investment opportunities, affect the wealth of households, and influence the cost of capital to firms and households, a compression of risk premia in the markets for capital and credit may have put the economy on a different expansion path where incomes grow faster and are less uncertain.  But, again, independent changes in financial markets can be of a structural or more transient nature.  I shall start with structural factors. A major source of structural evolution in financial markets over the last twenty years, one that is difficult to overlook and that is likely to last, comes under the encompassing label of increased financial market participation. Institutional investors, such as pension and mutual funds, hedge funds, and more recently sovereign wealth funds, have been playing an increasingly important role in many asset markets. The informed, active trading of these investors has increased market liquidity and led to a reduction in transactions costs. Deeper and less expensive markets have meant that the typical investor – once holding a poorly diversified portfolio with skewed returns – is now better diversified and thus more risk-tolerant. At the same time, the introduction of non-redundant and previously non-existing assets and liabilities has provided a further encouragement for investors and financial intermediaries to transform and transfer risk. The enhanced availability of these new instruments has increased the accessibility and availability of credit to the private sector. I will return to the toxic side of these developments in a minute. Here, as in many studies, I note that an increase in participation has the potential to decrease the required risk premium on a wide spectrum of assets, because it spreads market risk over a broader population. [10]  For a given amount of macroeconomic risk – a given quantum of macro-volatility – increased participation can cut the price of risk. And a lower price of risk that is due to a structural break in market participation rates is more likely to persist.  But transient factors in financial markets might have been at work as well. For a given quantum of macro-volatility and a given fundamental price of risk, markets can at times under-appreciate the former and under-price the latter. Risk aversion can fluctuate around a fundamental value which is determined by long-lasting evolutions in financial market infrastructures and financial market participation. And these more contingent fluctuations in risk aversion can be slow to re-absorb. Changes in risk aversion can at times look a lot like “bubbles”. But swings in risk aversion that will eventually revert back to some sort of equilibrium are, in my view, the manifestation of a phenomenon – more general than “bubbles” – which has been rationalised and modelled in various ways. [11] The important point is not so much to understand what causes such fluctuations in risk preferences – whether explosive expectations [12] or habit formation in consumption – but that they are ephemeral and, once they take off, they tend to fall back to ground.  Occasional waves of higher risk tolerance in financial markets can expand the supply of external finance for the productive sector and for government. And this can make previously unprofitable investment programs look attractive, which can boost growth. But, unlike more structural shifts in financial market infrastructures, occasional turns in risk tolerance are just that: occasional.  Reversion to some sort of steady values for risk appetite can undo established market trends and give rise to a prolonged period of strains in market valuations.       2. New channels of interaction    Varying risk premia blur the fundamental connection between asset prices and real economic decisions. This has been studied extensively and the evidence that I have provided thus far is, after all, but one variation on a traditional theme in financial economics: the risk premium puzzle. But today risk pricing and macroeconomic performance can make contact in ways that are novel and still little known. Here I would like to draw your attention to the increased participation of financial investors – especially hedge funds and institutional investors – in commodity markets. [13] This trend has accompanied the spectacular boom in commodity prices over the last few years and has complicated the interpretation of the fundamental drivers of prices in those markets in various phases.  We can take the oil futures markets as an example. Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at a future date, at a price agreed upon when entering the contract, the futures price. However, in regulated exchanges [such as NYMEX or ICE] these contracts are traded chiefly for hedging risk on price changes rather than for arranging physical delivery of oil. [14] Traditionally, these markets have been characterised, more frequently than not, by a market constellation of prices known as ‘backwardation’. This indicates a situation in which futures prices are below the current spot price [ see Figure 4]. [15] To understand what this means, note that both producers and consumers of oil are normally interested in hedging the risk of fluctuations in the future spot price of oil – which is unknown today. But, since oil production and supply is concentrated among far fewer participants than total consumption among consumers, suppliers are more likely to factor the risk of future price fluctuations into their economic decisions to a larger extent than any single buyer. This strengthens the incentive for suppliers to hedge against adverse fluctuations in spot prices. Traditionally, the market for oil futures has been a “sellers’ market.” And sellers have been on average happy to pay a premium to market traders willing to buy a futures contract and take upon themselves the risk of future spot price declines. “Backwardation” means that buyers as a whole normally agree to provide this insurance if they can expect to earn a positive premium on top of the expected change in the future price of oil. [16] Assuming that the best predictor of the spot price in the future is the current spot price, the spread between the current spot price and the futures price reflects the remuneration for the risk that buyers as a whole accept to bear. [17]  Over the last two decades when backwardation has been the norm, the risk premium paid by hedgers to financial investors has been relatively stable, moving predictably with the spot price of oil [Figure 4]. [18] More recently, since 2005, this relationship between the risk premium and the spot price of oil appears to have changed and risk premia paid by hedgers have been shrinking to become even negative between early 2005 and 2007. [19] This is clear from the evolution over time of the futures price curve [for Brent oil price], on which the ECB oil price projections are based. The curve clearly moved from a downward slope to an upward tilt around the same time and maintained the increasing tilt at least until the middle of 2007 [ Figure 5].  This atypical compression – and inversion – of the risk premia paid in the oil futures market has gone hand in hand with an appreciable change in the structure of these markets, with a growing involvement of non-commercial participants. The change in the composition of the market has been made evident by the emergence of a new net positive speculative position [Figure 6]. It seems as though the market for oil futures, traditionally dominated by hedging sellers, had at times become a “buyers’ market.” How are these developments to be interpreted? What is the direction of influence between fundamental trends in the real economy and the pricing of financial risk? A fundamentals-driven interpretation has it that increasing futures prices indeed signal a fundamental break in spot price expectations: which traditionally had been “mean-reverting” and might have become persistently bullish, reflecting a perceived break in the anticipated imbalances between oil demand and oil production on a global scale. But observers focusing on the change in the balance between short and long positions in the market have pointed to the possibility that futures prices – determined on a market in which buyers are increasingly motivated by a search for financial yield rather than the incentive to hedge – might have been contributing in certain market phases to movements in the spot price.  Have financial investors played a stabilising or a destabilizing role at a time of booming commodity prices and heightened uncertainty about their long-term fundamentals? According to a benign view, ‘financial investors’ have expanded liquidity in commodity markets, and have made the market more efficient in processing information, thus improving price discovery at a time of greater uncertainty about fundamentals. New financial actors such as highly leveraged funds and institutional investors may have contributed to lowering spreads and the associated risk premia in commodity futures markets by spreading their own portfolio risk more widely. In this sense, they may even have strengthened the traditional insurance role of futures markets. In addition, financial investors may have helped bring forward price increases that would have occurred nonetheless. This may have provided a signal to both consumers and producers that they needed to start adjusting their consumption and investment plans before the economy hits the physical constraints of oil supply. In this sense, some volatility today might have been the price to pay to avoid even higher volatility in the future. But, according to an opposite interpretation, financial investors operating systematically on the futures market might have reduced the risk and the cost faced by sellers who want to accumulate inventories, or possibly delay production to gain from steep anticipated price trends. In this way they might have exacerbated changes in prices and inventories due to predicted changes in fundamentals. They might have sent noisier and potentially distorted signals to producers and consumers. [20]  If this seems to me a reasonable conjecture, I admit, though, that existing evidence does not provide uncontroversial support to the notion that non-commercial investors in futures markets have been systematically playing a significant role in pushing spot prices out of their fundamental equilibrium.       3. Interpreting the present situation    Since August 2007, markets have become increasingly discriminating with regard to the risks posed by the real investment projects underlying a wide range of securitised credit. This new attitude is reflected in the large rebounds in risk premia that I have noted in my charts. Spreads on financial institution debt, in particular, have widened in the euro area and in the US reflecting uncertainty over the extent of future credit write-offs, the full recognition of off-balance-sheet commitments, and future earnings capacity. The wide perception in the markets is that financial institutions face difficulties in maintaining earnings due to falling credit quality and declining fee income in a macro-economic environment already taxed by sharp rises in real production costs. As intermediaries tend to economise on capital, assets are being sold and lending conditions have tightened. As I have shown in Figure 3, the correction in the appraisal of risk has thus been broad-based, and spreads on funding costs for corporates have stuck to levels that had not been on market records for a long period of time.  My conjecture is that the recent corrections and retrenchments in financial markets bring two lessons and leave much to be learned from future analysis and experience. I start from the two lessons.     First, as has often happened in the past, non-fundamental market dynamics have grown out of fundamentals and the feed-back loops that these have created. As I said already, increased financial market participation has set a new secular trend toward a lower price of risk sustained by long-term financial deepening. Financial deepening, in turn, has initially responded to a real demand for a more efficient sharing of risk. More effective risk sharing has meant better mechanisms through which producers and ultimate savers can hedge open positions arising from their real transactions. As a side-effect, this process – generalised to a wide range of markets – has brought sustained capital gains to an expanding number of beneficiaries. This, in turn, has improved incomes and the economic outlook. And the process has been feeding and reinforcing itself.    Second lesson: “good health is always a precarious situation that does not presage anything good.” At some point in the maturing process, brighter prospects have meant under-assessment of the macroeconomic risk and under-pricing of the unit quantity of risk. Financial markets have ceased to facilitate the dispersion of the risk that is intrinsic to the underlying economic activities, and they have developed into formidable risk multipliers. The new structured financial products that grew exponentially in the ten years leading up to the recent disorders in financial markets, by pooling and repackaging income streams of different quality, gave the false impression that the benefits of diversification would reduce the risks inherent in the underlying assets. But the leverage embedded in those products meant that end-investors were in fact exposed to a quantum of risk that could outstrip – rather than mitigate – that implied by the underlying pool of assets. Excessive leverage was the mechanism which – at some point – turned an efficient process of risk diffusion into a dangerous spiral of risk amplification and concentration.    Third: stable institutions and firm monetary policy frameworks are needed more than ever in times of turbulence: financial stability is no substitute to price stability. The latter is a precondition to the former. As I said, a significant part of the decline in macroeconomic uncertainty is no windfall for modern societies: it is the fair and expected reward for institutional reform. In continental Europe, this reform has been induced largely by the need to converge to sound macroeconomic policies as signalled, in particular, by the best macroeconomic regimes that were available in the Continent. The process has been successful, both historically – comparing performances before and after monetary union [Figure 1b] – and in cross-section. This figure [Figure 7] establishes a comparison between macroeconomic volatilities in the euro area and elsewhere since 1999: a comprehensive cross section of international macroeconomic outcomes. Despite recent shocks, the euro area countries have compressed aggregate risk relative to their past, and have done it beyond the standards that are set by other countries. Stable and transparent monetary institutions have helped the economy before – remember the stock market collapse of the early years of this decade – and will help this time.    But – here suggestions for further reflection and analysis start – to what extent have stable macroeconomic frameworks genuinely squeezed risks out of the system? And to what extent have they encouraged over-confidence and complacency? We saw that complacency played a role in the under-pricing of risk in a certain market phase. But the remaining question is whether the relaxation in financial prudence could have been triggered by false expectations of a perennially smooth economic environment that policymakers could have avoided in words and deeds.   Developments in financial markets have largely coincided with pressures on the real costs of commodities which – in terms of intensity and persistence – have been largely unprecedented. As I tried to argue, it is not clear whether the inversion of the oil futures curve – with futures prices occasionally increasing above spot prices – should be taken to signal a permanent inversion of spot price expectations, presaging a long period of further appreciations in the real price of energy. Or, simply, it should be understood as yet another reflection of a varying risk premium signalling a wedge between asset prices and fundamentals.     Today more than ever before, efforts – by scholars and central banks alike – to connect market returns and risk pricing to a fuller range of macroeconomic phenomena have high potential pay-offs. The challenge, in the end, is to build models that can match asset pricing facts, while at the same time maintaining – if not improving on – the existing business cycle models’ ability to account for quantity fluctuations. This is no small challenge. These models would need to match the price of risk and the relative volatilities of consumption, output and investment. By doing so, they would offer instruments for evaluating the predictability of asset returns – and their cross-section – based on assumptions about the evolution of the real economy.  They would allow interpreting the drawn-out declines in risk appreciation that have spanned more than two decades. Most importantly, they would be suitable tools to measure the exact proportion in which the more recent changes in risk premia reflect stable breaks in the reward for risk, or are products of transient market whims. They would help disentangle the effects on commodity prices of fundamental trends in oil demand – which are likely to be sustained and thus most relevant for policy – from the swinging influences of new financial strategies. Ideally, these new models would offer ways to simulate and stress-test situations of unquantifiable – Knightian – uncertainly, where past correlations collapse and perverse expectations determine new dynamics.       4. Implications for financial participants     But, as I speak, we still have a lot of work to elucidate these interactions.  Financial participants and policymakers have to rely on robust behavioural rules that can minimise the chance that business strategies and policy decisions might be based on a misguided model or an over-optimistic representation of economic reality. I will start with two fundamental principles that should govern the business model of financial operators and protect them from the hazards of excessive risk taking. I will then turn to monetary policy.  First, financial participation and financial sophistication find their limit in complexity. The recent experience has taught us that increasing complexity of financial instruments can undermine the benefits of financial innovation. Savers become more risk averse – sometimes through abrupt retractions from market trading – if faced with increasing difficulties in evaluating the risk to which they are exposed. The recent market strains started to pose challenges to the macro-economy at large when investors sought clarity about the quality of specific assets supporting investment securities, and shed those whose risk they could not easily assess. And a primary source of losses for financial institutions came from the concentrated exposures that were implicit in the warehousing, structuring and trading of complex credit derivatives. Complexity prevented them from fully appreciating the possibility that the losses in the underlying assets could – in distressed market conditions – reach levels which would impair the value of the super-senior tranches that they had retained in their balance sheets.  Second, the management and the valuation of risk at the level of business units have become critical activities. As I said before, expanded financial participation can cut the share of risk that each participant shoulders at each point in time. But the dark side of this phenomenon is that it also provides an encouragement for financial services organisations to expand the overall amount of risk that is traded. And it weakens market participants’ anti-bodies against excessive individual exposure and risk taking. There is evidence that the financial firms that have performed better since the turmoil began a year ago are those in which management had established rigorous internal processes and discipline in the valuation of risk. Those are firms that had not exclusively relied on external views of credit risk – from rating agencies or pricing services – but had also developed in-house expertise to conduct independent assessments of the most critical positions. They had established stronger internal checks over individual business lines to control activities that had the potential to lead to significant balance sheet growth or unexpected reductions in capital. The sophistication of their risk measurement processes had kept pace with increasing risk taking. The quantitative methodologies employed were varied – notional limits to risk assumption, value-at-risk indicators, stress tests and forward-looking scenario analysis – and flexible, so that management could quickly vary assumptions about the scale of shocks or the degree of market volatility and the pattern of asset correlations in difficult market conditions. These firms had resisted the tendency – which becomes widespread in times when risks seem well-distributed and traders well-diversified – to a dilution of the incentive to exercise prudence.  Controlling the primary sources of excessive risk taking is within the control of major financial participants. It is critical that internal processes and practices be deployed that can curb the tendency to expand business aggressively in times of greater propensity to risk taking, to a point beyond the capacity of the relevant control infrastructures.  Supervisory oversight can and will support efforts in this direction. Among other supporting measures, strengthened prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management is of the essence to ensure an appropriate capital treatment and disclosure of on and off-balance exposures and that liquidity buffers correspond to the liquidity risks incurred. Supervisors and regulators will communicate early to firms’ boards their risk management concerns and the need to take responsive action.       5. Implications for monetary policy    The swinging and unpredictable interactions between the markets and real economic decisions are unlikely to have long-lasting and severe consequences for the macro-economy as long as monetary policy maintains a clear sense of direction.  I already highlighted the role that new monetary policy frameworks have played in the transition to a new macroeconomic regime, in which incomes, consumption and other measures of economic welfare follow a steadier course. As I tried to argue, the interpretation of the link between the reduction in macroeconomic uncertainty – the Great Moderation – and the pricing of that uncertainty in the markets poses many unresolved issues. But very few observers and scholars would object that central banks’ commitment to keeping inflation low and stable, their improved communication about their price stability objectives and their acting on those objectives by the force of deeds, has importantly contributed to the reduction in macroeconomic risk that we find in the data. They would also agree that if aggregate – un-diversifiable – risk diminishes, this ought to be reflected in the premia that financial markets pay for risk taking. That fraction of reduced risk compensations is a stable acquisition of modern economies. The complement to that fraction – what is due to excessive financial sophistication, abnormal risk tolerance and shortcomings in risk management; and what is due to the persistence of international imbalances and the steady appreciation of commodities – will pass.  At this stage, let me make three remarks.  First, we have exercised an ongoing warning function, whenever the amount and the price of risk traded in financial markets had departed from the trends that appeared justified by lasting changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Our communication on the financial imbalances that were being created in the over-confident market conditions that prevailed until the summer of 2007 has been vindicated ex post. Starting from last summer, financial markets have finally initiated a process of re-pricing of risk to more appropriate levels, and to pay more attention to the quality of the assets they invest in, although this process has been significantly less orderly than we would have hoped. Since risk premia across a wide spectrum of assets had fallen to excessively low levels, their return to more appropriate values—and the accompanying process of financial de-leveraging—is to be regarded as a necessary development. Under this respect, the most appropriate policy response is therefore to allow such process to take place in an as orderly way as possible, playing a supporting role whenever medium-term downside risk to price stability might emerge along the way.  Second, we have been crystal-clear since the beginning of the financial turbulence that we would make a strict separation between the monetary policy stance – which is designed exclusively to deliver price stability in the medium term in an exceptionally difficult period – and the implementation of this monetary policy through the Eurosystem credit operations. These operations were designed with a view to maintaining the short-term rates close to our policy rates within an environment of turbulent money markets. This concept has been well understood by market participants and has preserved the integrity and the credibility of our monetary policy. It has also facilitated our fundamental goal to preserve a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability. Third, let me concentrate on inflation expectations in an environment of sustained supply-side shocks. We need to consider that the sequence of shocks to commodity prices that we have faced in the past five years confronts us with a difficult identification problem. Supply-side shocks that hit in one direction for such a prolonged period of time can become engrained in inflation expectations. If – and when – this happens, then these shocks change their nature. If they de-stabilise expectations, they become more similar to demand shocks. A demand shock calls for a shorter policy horizon. Our policy horizon is the medium term, and the medium term should be taken to be at least as long as the average transmission lag for policy actions. While facing rises in commodity prices, the policy horizon could theoretically be more extended. But, the circumstances that I just described are not typical and the risk that a repeated sequence of supply-side shocks might turn into a demand disturbance with long-lasting implications for price stability has made our horizon shorter. It has made it closer to the average transmission lag.       6. Concluding remarks    As I pointed out in my opening remarks, these are testing times. The financial turbulence that started last summer, and the increases in commodity prices of the last few years, conjured to create a very challenging environment, in which central banks have to simultaneously face off the fragilities of the financial fabric and the inflationary pressures originating from global commodity markets. It is precisely during such difficult times that the benefits of a solid monetary framework oriented to price stability become apparent. Our framework—with a strong mandate for price stability, a focus on a firm anchoring of inflation expectations, and a crucial role assigned to a monetary aggregates—is, under this respect, ideally suited to the challenges we are currently facing, as it encodes the lessons of the central banks which, during the 1970s, successfully ‘opted out’ of the Great Inflation. This framework, coupled with our absolute resolve to avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1970s, will guarantee price stability, thus contributing to economic growth and job creation in the euro area.

[1]  Defining the stream of cash-flows earned by the asset by {dt}t=0...∞, the market price at time t of an asset with an extremely long maturity, pt, satisfies the following identity: pt = ∑j=1... ∞ (1+ rt + πt)-j Et dt+j, where Et is the expectations operator at time t. The financial factor that is used to discount the expected stream of payouts, rt + πt, has two components: a risk-free rate, rt, which could be earned on a competing asset with certain returns, and an excess rate of return, πt, which remunerates the investor for the added risk that she is taking on. I shall refer to the latter factor, interchangeably, as excess return or risk premium.      [2]  Referring to the formula in the previous footnote, and interpreting {dt}t=0...∞ as the actual (ex post) stream of dividend payments, systematic underprediction of the dividend stream looking forward from any given vantage point t can result in an underestimation of the return that can be expected, at t, from holding the stock at the current price pt because the market price grows at the growth rate of the actual dividend payments.      [3]  In fact there are more problems. First, explaining low equity risk premia with systematic under-prediction of income streams has limited explanatory power. If anything, the scant evidence available on earnings expectations point in the opposite direction. Sharpe (1999), for example, finds that in the period between 1994 and the end of the century forecasts of two-year nominal earnings growth were high and stable (between 10% and 15%), even though realised two-year earnings growth were declining. It should also be noted that higher growth in realised payoffs, per se, is not sufficient to account for price movements over the entire sample, because dividend-to-price and earning-to-price ratios have themselves trended down. The secular fall in the dividend-to-price and earnings-to-price ratios is actually the fact that needs to be explained in the first place. See, among many others, Jagannathan, McGrattan and Scherbina (2000). Second, concerning low term premia, foreign official purchases of US bonds – by the monetary authorities of countries which follow a stable exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the US dollar – was found to have played little or no role as a factor contributing to low long-term interest rates in a study of the interest rate conundrum. See Rudebusch, Swanson and Wu (2006).      [4]  The level of inflation is found to be correlated with its variability, which in turn should influence people’s perceptions of the degree of uncertainty that surrounds their macroeconomic environments.      [5]  In many standard asset-pricing models with complete markets, the risk premium, or excess return, paid by an asset with uncertain payoffs is proportional to the volatility of consumption, with a risk aversion parameter as the constant of proportionality. In these models, aggregate consumption volatility stands for the quantity of risk, while the parameter scaling agents’ risk aversion stands for the price of risk. A crucial subsidiary assumption behind this logic is that all wealth – including human capital – is tradable, so that the aggregate return can be interpreted as the gross return to an asset that represents a claim to aggregate consumption.      [6]  Stock and Watson (2002), among others, show that the decline in volatility appears in a large number of macroeconomic time series: employment growth, consumption growth, inflation and sectoral output growth, as well as in GDP growth. The decline is not confined to the US economy, but is well visible in a vast array of economies, both industrialised and developing, with few exceptions.      [7]  A correlation between different indicators of equity valuations and consumption volatility for a set of eleven industrialised countries has been noted before. See, for example, Lettau, Ludvigson and Wachter (2008). But Figures 1 and 2 document that evidence of this type of correlation is more pervasive than studied in their paper.      [8]  A detailed discussion along these lines of the impact of a fall in the volatility of inflation and output growth on the bond term premium can be found, e.g., in Plosser (2007).     [9]  Benati and Surico (2008) finds that the role of stabilising monetary policy can go some way toward explaining the Great Moderation.      [10]  The emergence and growth of new financial intermediaries can have further and deeper causes. For example, the more recent, accelerated integration of emerging markets into the global economy may have led to an increase in global savings and, as a result, to a growing demand for financial services and new financial operators. Also, the achievements of peak-savings years by the baby-boom generation might have expanded the pool of resources that need to be intermediated by specialised pension funds. In fact, the abundance of global savings – whether induced by the globalisation of economic processes or by the aging of a large share of the world population – is indeed one of the explanations advanced for the exceptionally low bond yields recently observed in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, also in the Euro area.     [11]  For example, models in which investors’ preferences display habit formation – the argument of utility is not the absolute level of consumption but the level of consumption relative to some “normal” level – can generate time-varying risk tolerance. Agents are more risk averse when current consumption is around the level that they consider “normal” based on their past income/consumption history. In these circumstances – which indeed should apply in normal times – only a small fraction of consumption is available as a surplus to generate utility, and even small shocks to consumption can have a large effect on this surplus. Therefore, investors are extremely risk averse. A positive shock to income can cause actual consumption to exceed its perceived “normal” by a wide margin and for a prolonged period of time. This increases agents’ risk appetite because now the consumption surplus is larger. Campbell and Cochrane (1999) prove that the (equity) risk premium can fluctuate due to this mechanism.      [12]  Within the cash-flow-discount model for asset pricing that is expounded in footnote 2, seemingly explosive price dynamics can be generated by a sequence of negative innovations to the risk premium, πt.      [13]  See, for example, Domanski and Heath (2007).      [14]  Although physical delivery of oil may occur, this in reality occurs rather rarely. Contracts are instead liquidated before expiration usually leading to exchange of cash among market participants. So, for example, while an airline normally buys jet fuel through its usual physical supplier, it can purchase a futures contract to hedge possible price increase over the subsequent months. If the price actually rises, the gain from liquidating the futures contract towards expiration will offset the loss from the greater cost of fuel.      [15]  The opposite situation in which the term structure of futures prices is upward sloping is known in traders’ jargon as “contango”, and has traditionally occurred less frequently than “backwardation”.     [16]  Some financial participants may be enticed to buy or sell futures contracts by different views on the future oil price than the market. But on average financial participants are net buyers and assuming that they are on average no better than sellers in predicting the future spot price, they will need a discount over the price expected at the expiration of the futures contract to be motivated to purchase it.      [17]  This risk premium is the mirror image of what sellers as a group are willing to give up for the benefits of holding physical inventories of oil, which have the important role of ensuring the continuation of production and sale in the face of potential disruption in the oil supply chain. In jargon inventories provide a “convenience yield”, which in the oil market can be quite sizeable. The convenience yield is normally inversely related to the deviation of inventories from their desired size.      [18]  This pattern presumably reflected the belief of market participants in a stable long-run price of oil to which the spot price was expected to revert eventually.      [19]  Here we focus on a measure of the risk premium (or roll return) earned by buyers of futures based on the assumption that the best predictor of the future spot oil price is today spot price. This allows an immediate interpretation of the observed spreads over the spot price at which futures contracts are traded. And, most importantly, over longer samples it is found to be the most accurate predictor (Alquist and Kilian, 2008). However, other measures of the risk premium in oil futures are also conceivable and used in practise (in particular in central banks’ forecasts). For example, Pagano and Pisani (2006) regress the ex-post realised risk premium on a constant and the degree of variable capacity utilisation in US manufacturing (a proxy for the state of the business cycle), taking the fitted value as their measure of risk premium.      [20]  The accumulation of inventories may have sustained increasing spot prices from 2003 till the middle of 2007. Yet the spot price has continued to rise since. The fall in inventories may of course simply be due to tighter fundamentals.      ']\n",

I remember the first time I met you all four years ago. I was impressed by the vision demonstrated by you all and I was enthused by the huge task ahead. Today, we still have this vision and I would urge you now to complete the task. Not going on means falling back, which means risking losing what has already been achieved, letting others reap the benefits of the Single Market. When China participated in the Olympics for the first time, which was in 1932 in Los Angeles, then still the “Republic of China”, the team was small; it was made up of a single athlete. When the “Peoples’ Republic of China” participated for the first time in the Summer Olympics, once again in Los Angeles, but this time in 1984, they won 15 gold medals and finished fourth in the medal ranking. When China accepted to host the Olympics in 2008, it was with the clear intention of winning more medals than any other nation – and it did win more medals than any of the other teams that had been successful for decades. Are we ready for the Olympics with our SEPA project? Do we pursue our vision with the necessary zeal? The first results of intense training are visible – the SEPA credit transfer scheme has taken off; 1% of transfers five months after the start is not the critical mass required yet, but new facilities for merchants and corporates are on the way. The SEPA direct debit scheme – clearly the member in the team with a serious handicap. One hurdle – the Payments Services Directive (PSD) – has been overcome. For the first time, a consistent legal framework will be applied in each country. The second hurdle – the questions surrounding the multilateral balancing payment (MBP) — will have to be overcome as soon as possible. If no solution were to be found, the momentum might be lost and the system could fall to pieces again, with all the negative consequences for all those involved. Not to mention the third hurdle – today’s cards’ business. There we are at a crossroads as well. Either diversity should be preserved or lack of competition could lead to high fees for customers. Let me focus on three issues today:      Direct debit scheme;   End-date for migration; and   Communication.        1. SEPA direct debit scheme needs to move forward    So, which are the main problems that the SEPA coaches still face today with regard to the SEPA direct debit scheme?      Migration of mandates    One is a legal issue. How can we ensure that there are no problems in the migration from the existing mandates to the new SEPA direct debit mandates? For creditors, it would be a great burden if customers had to sign new mandates when switching from the national direct debit schemes to the SEPA direct debit scheme. Some countries have already found answers to this problem; other countries are still looking for a pragmatic solution. If it were to become necessary to make amendments to national legislation, the transposition of the PSD into national law would provide a good opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. National legislators should not miss this opportunity to help the payments business to become more efficient, innovative and truly European.       Reluctance of users    Communication needs to be stepped up. This is particularly valid for the SEPA direct debit scheme. Direct debit users are reluctant. They have heard rumours and are afraid that it will not meet their needs. It is not safe, it is too safe, it is not modern, it is too modern, it is too different or more expensive than previous procedures; a lot of opinions were voiced before the product was even visible. Perhaps, the coaches were too busy defining the training schedule and therefore did not have sufficient time to train the athletes?  All users should be made aware that their special needs can be met by means of individual offers from their banks, by transparent additional optional services that are offered by groups of banks or by additional services that can be offered at the level of whole banking communities. You will have noticed that I stressed the word “transparent” in connection with additional optional services. Transparency is crucial, because we do not want to see fragmentation re-introduced through the back door by additional optional services, the main aim of which is to protect markets and hamper competition.  Users are also concerned about the prices. If we want the users to embrace the SEPA direct debit scheme, it is clear that prices for these services to end-users should not go up. Otherwise, we will face a tough challenge “selling” SEPA to the wider public.  You may also be aware that EU Regulation 2560 — the so-called price regulation which was enacted in 2001 — is currently up for review. Regulation 2560 applies to the customer-to-bank domain. It is the clear intention to broaden the scope of Regulation 2560 from credit transfers and card payments to include direct debits. So, at the end of this review process, banks will very likely face a situation where the prices for cross-border direct debits will not be allowed to be higher than the prices for national direct debits. This may have an additional dampening effect on prices. In any case, an increase in national prices, as a result of the review, would clearly be against the spirit of the review and severely affect banks’ reputation and credibility in the eyes of their customers.      Multilateral interchange fee for direct debits    Costs and prices are not only a matter of concern in the customer-to-bank domain, but in the bank-to-bank domain too. The multilateral balancing payment (MBP) — or “multilateral interchange fee” as I prefer to call it, because that is what it essentially is — has proven to be a thorny issue.  Today’s practice regarding multilateral interchange fees (or “MIFs”) for national direct debits varies across countries. So, what should be done for the SEPA direct debit scheme? A European solution has to be found by the banks which is also agreeable to the European competition authority. But SEPA direct debits have to be rolled out in a little more than one year from now. This will hardly be enough time to find a comprehensive solution that meets all needs and answers all concerns. We face a situation where bankers run the risk of not being able to deliver the direct debits by November 2009. This is not acceptable, because SEPA direct debits are a vital piece in the SEPA puzzle. It would threaten the very existence of a Single Euro Payments Area, run counter to the goals of the Lisbon agenda, reverse all the work and efforts invested in this project, and throw the payments sector back into the “dark ages” of fragmentation along national borders.  I would therefore like to test an idea with you. As I said before, we need a European solution, but we won’t have it ready in one year’s time. Defining and implementing this solution would probably take some more time. Coming back to the world of the Olympics, it would neither be a sprint of 100 metres, but certainly no marathon either, perhaps the best analogy is a 400-metre run, one circuit in the stadium.  What does the runner have to take into account before he or she starts the circuit? I understand that there may no longer be any future for a general, transaction-based MIF. Neither for the current national direct debits nor for the upcoming SEPA direct debits. Against this background, I would like to make a suggestion. A suggestion which respects the views of the competition authorities, but also takes into consideration three further aspects: First, the importance of getting the SEPA direct debit scheme launched by November 2009, second, the need to create a level playing-field between the national and the SEPA direct debit scheme in the short to medium term, and third the time banks still need to develop a possible new compensation model.       Possible interim solution    What we therefore need is an interim solution. This interim solution should be pragmatic and should be acceptable for a limited period of time to make the SEPA direct debit scheme fly. The objective of this interim solution is to have, right from the start, at the very least, a level playing-field in place for the SEPA direct debit scheme compared with the national, legacy direct debit schemes. Of course, the ultimate aim continues to be the total replacement of any national legacy direct debit scheme with the SEPA direct debit scheme.  What is my suggestion for an interim period as from November 2009? There are currently no MIFs for cross-border direct debits, simply because direct debits are currently not executed on a cross-border basis. Directly after the roll-out, we expect that only very few cross-border SEPA direct debits will be carried out. We believe that allowing a properly justified MIF for cross-border SEPA direct debits during an interim phase would help to make SEPA ultimately successful.  But what should happen with transactions at the national level carried out by either the old legacy direct debit schemes or the new SEPA direct debit scheme?  During the interim phase, the existing legacy MIFs could remain in place and be applied to both legacy direct debits and SEPA direct debits carried out at the national level. As such, any changes to the legacy MIF should be applicable to the SEPA direct debit scheme too. This would ensure the necessary level playing-field in the national context for the SEPA direct debit scheme and the national legacy direct debit schemes that I mentioned before. Given that most direct debits will initially still be conducted at the national level, the vast majority of direct debits would thus be treated in the same manner. Customers, in particular creditors, would not need to be afraid of prices increasing. Banks would not see their business model change.  I would like to reiterate that this is only a temporary solution, for I understand that at the end of the interim period, there would no longer be any transaction-based MIF, neither at the national level nor at the cross-border level, neither for SEPA direct debits nor for legacy direct debits, which would anyway have to be phased out.  However, nothing prevents banks from devising other forms of compensation for the future. There are different models conceivable, or already in use, in order to cover costs and to provide incentives for those involved to offer and to use direct debits. If this compensation is based on a proper calculation and methodology, it should also be acceptable to competition authorities. Both sides are important here, demand and supply, banks should not only want to offer SEPA direct debits, but customers should also want to use them.        2. We need a migration end-date    What is also crucial for SEPA to be ultimately successful is to have a firm plan after when the SEPA instruments would replace the national payment instruments. All studies carried out on this subject in the past showed the same result: It is inefficient, it is costly, and it will not generate economies of scale, if two schemes continue to run in parallel for a long period of time. In short, it will prevent stakeholders from fully reaping the benefits of SEPA.  Let me be clear on this: The national payment instruments will have to be phased out at some point in time if we are really serious about creating a Single Euro Payments Area. Maintaining national instruments means maintaining fragmentation.  Right now, with SEPA credit transfers already up and running, a migration end-date should be defined soon. There is no rationale for keeping national and SEPA credit transfers running in parallel for an indefinite period of time. For the SEPA direct debit scheme, we are investigating whether it would be more useful to wait until they are rolled out so that stakeholders are able to gain some practical experience first. At the recent stakeholders’ forum on direct debits, some misunderstandings and reservations were already addressed. However, it still remains to be seen whether the end-date for SEPA direct debit scheme should be set now or later.  The best way to set an end-date is still open for debate. In our view, there are various options available. One would be self-regulation; another would be regulation by the legislators. Regardless of who takes the initiative, regulation could be done directly by determining a date for abolishing the use of national schemes, or, indirectly, for example, by mandating the use of IBAN or the respective ISO standard. As I said before, this debate is still ongoing and I would in fact be happy to receive your feedback on what you consider to be the best end-date and the way to achieve this.       3. Communication    We believe that some users are still uneasy about switching to SEPA because they do not know enough about SEPA and its advantages.  Users need to know more about SEPA, the SEPA instruments, or the different possibilities that exist to add features to core schemes so that they fulfil specific needs. In short, users need more effective communication; SEPA needs to be “sold” to the users. First of all, there is a need for continuous and increased efforts to explain the changes and advantages which SEPA will bring to the different end-users. A second way to sell SEPA better is to offer attractive SEPA products and services. SEPA should be user-friendly for customers, whether they are large corporates, merchants, consumers or SMEs. When it comes to SEPA-readiness, there might be a gap between being “technically ready” to send and receive SEPA payments and offering marketable, user-friendly SEPA products and services. For example, BBAN-to-IBAN conversion facilities, the use of IBAN only, easy-to-use internet banking applications are simple, but also very effective examples of these “must have” services and products. People have a natural inclination to cling on to things they know and like. Why fix something if it is not broken? Here, the onus is mainly on you, the banks, to provide more information to your customers and to convince them with concrete, marketable, and high-quality offers. You have the direct contact and you are best placed to inform them. Naturally, public authorities have to play a role in disseminating information and we will continue to do so. But what is crucial, at this point in time, is more effective communication about SEPA from the banks to the user level. In my opinion, communication is a core task for the EPC; not to take over national responsibilities, but to support the national communication efforts with clear messages for the different target groups.      4. Cash issues    Let me also say a few words about cash.  The ECB welcomes the continuous dialogue between the ESCB Banknote Committee and the EPC Cash Working Group and – more specifically — the cooperative spirit of the discussions. Work is progressing regarding the implementation of the “Roadmap for more convergence of NCB cash services” and the development of the second series of euro banknotes is on its way. The European Commission has set up a special working group consisting of – inter alia – the EPC, Eurosystem representatives and the Commission to tackle the issue of cross-border transport of cash on the road. No Single Euro Cash Area will exist without having solved this issue. Furthermore, we took note that the EPC raised strong concerns regarding the Commission’s proposal to amend Regulation 1338 dated 2001. This regulation deals with measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. Certain concerns on the part of the EPC are in line with the concerns raised by the ECB in its formal opinion and I would like to ask the Commission to take a careful look at the matter.      Conclusion: Strong governance role of the EPC is needed    Today, I have mentioned a number of issues that are vital in order to make SEPA a success. All this can only be achieved – and I would really like to underline this – if the EPC continues to fulfil its role as the banks’ governing body in charge of payment issues. A strong coach and diligent training are crucial for any athlete’s success. What the EPC has achieved so far should not be the end of the story. The SEPA schemes are in place or ready to be put in place. But SEPA needs to develop further. Further improvements to the Rulebooks are under way, which will help to make the core schemes even more attractive. Another road to pursue is the development of innovative services, which will pave the way for a highly efficient euro payments business in the future. For example, we expect pan-European priority payments and e and m-payment solutions to be delivered, and let us not forget about e-invoicing.  To come back to the Chinese and Olympic imagery: following the fireworks at the opening ceremony we are on the long march, we all feel the pains of marching on the plains.  But I am convinced that SEPA will be a success. The example of China and the Olympics might help you to understand the final objective: making Europe more competitive and more innovative. By doing so, 100 medals for Europe will only be the beginning. Thank you very much for your attention.   ']\n",

I would like to express my gratitude to the European Agency for Reconstruction and to the Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic of Serbia for supporting this programme, in which the European Central Bank (ECB) and 17 central banks of EU Member States will be working closely with our colleagues at the National Bank of Serbia (NBS).  Speaking also on behalf of our central bank partners, I would like to say that we are very much looking forward to these coming nine months. Later during this press conference I will confirm the commitment of the ECB and our partner national central banks to implementing the programme by signing a protocol which confirms the common goals of all stakeholders in the programme. The ECB and our partners in the European System of Central Banks have an interest in developments in Serbia and in the Western Balkans in general; these countries form what we call our neighbouring region. We share a common destiny with all of you, and we are being confronted with common challenges, for instance in the pursuit of monetary and financial stability.  In order to achieve our common mandates of low inflation and stable financial sectors we need to make sure that some prerequisites are met, most importantly in terms of the complete independence of the central bank from political instructions, in order to permit a firm stability-oriented course of monetary policy. We also know that stability-oriented monetary policies need to be accompanied by coherent policy-making in other economic areas, above all in fiscal policy. This is universally true, in Belgrade and in any of our capitals in the European Union. There are many reasons for our interest in engaging in this programme with the NBS. Let me highlight some of them.  Serbia is a country – and more generally the Western Balkans is a region – whose financial sector is deeply intertwined with that of Europe and more specifically of the euro area: we therefore share the same concerns for the stability of our banks.  Moreover, for a number of reasons – ranging from the desire of citizens to protect their savings from hyperinflation and financial fragility to intense flows of tourists and migrants – the European national currencies in the past and the euro today have played a special role in this region, including in Serbia.  This country – and once again, this region – must be commended for its remarkable progress in economic terms over the past years. Growth has been sustained, confidence in the currencies has strengthened, the financial sector has deepened and new investment has been attracted. Private economic agents have started the long march towards catching up with their competitors in the single market.  At the same time, it is of the utmost importance – and I am sure Governor Jelašić will agree – to continue monitoring closely the remaining challenges, especially at a time when financial and economic conditions worldwide have become less supportive. The fight for economic stability is never won once and for all. Serbia’s status as a potential EU candidate country implies that, once the conditions are met, the NBS will join the European System of Central Banks and, upon sustainable compliance with conditions of economic convergence, also the Eurosystem.  We expect the programme that is being launched today to enable us to make advances in our mutual understanding of your situation and to design together the path for your adaptation to EU standards. To this aim, over a period of nine months we will carry out a needs analysis of the current regulatory and operational framework of the NBS, as well as of its policies and practices. All of these elements will be measured against a benchmark represented by the standard institutional and operational pattern of an EU central bank’s operating policies and practices.  In practice, experts from the ECB and the other 17 EU national central banks will undertake missions here, hold discussions with their colleagues, try to identify the specificities of your central bank, and build an understanding with you of where and how you would like to achieve progress. Our experts will come as colleagues, not to judge but to support you.  During these nine months, the analysis will cover six areas: 1) supervision of banks; 2) harmonisation of legislation in line with the acquis communautaire under the competence of the NBS; 3) liberalisation of capital movements; 4) conduct of monetary policy and foreign exchange rate regime; 5) monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics; and 6) financial services consumer protection.  There will be a need to coordinate these efforts, and to produce a coherent picture of the different recommendations. This will be the main task of Mr Thijs Kettenis, policy advisor at De Nederlandsche Bank, who will be our Resident Programme Coordinator here in Belgrade. He is here today, and I would like to wish him full success in this undertaking. The analysis will be carried out by the ECB together with colleagues from the national central banks of Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom..  It is a long list of countries, but I felt it was absolutely necessary to mention all of them. I would like to warmly greet the representatives from several of these participating central banks, who have accompanied me here today.  Of course, the work which confronts all of us in the coming months goes beyond setting benchmarks and recommending solutions in these six areas. We are today marking the start of a strong strategic partnership between our central banks, through which we intend to support and add to the achievements already attained by the NBS up until now.  We will be building this strategic partnership on strong foundations. Many of our central banks have already established an intensive dialogue with the monetary authorities of Serbia – and in some cases this began several years ago.  If I may for one moment refer to my personal experience at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank – before I took up the position in the ECB Executive Board in 2003 – I would like to recall how intense the cooperation was with the monetary authorities of all our neighbours. The same is true for many of the other central banks involved in this programme. I am sure that we will find you highly motivated partners. On our side, you will find both commitment and enthusiasm.  I would like to wish the programme the very best of luck.     SEE ALSO  Find out more about related content   Press release ECB/ESCB co-operation with the National Bank of Serbia   ']\n",

I would like to thank the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas for inviting me to speak at this panel discussion on “World Economic Opportunities, Risks and Prospects”. In my remarks, I would like to present you our current assessment, mainly – but not exclusively – from a European perspective, of the economic outlook and to address a number of issues pertaining to financial market developments and prospects.  * * * At the current juncture, the performance of the global economy is being strongly influenced by the simultaneous effects of two substantial and persistent shocks: (1) the significant increase in the price of oil and the prices of other commodities, including many food products, and (2) the turmoil in the financial markets of advanced economies which erupted more than a year ago.  The magnitude and duration of these two shocks are adversely affecting both the current economic situation and the outlook for the global economy. In the advanced industrial economies, the large rise in oil and other commodity prices – crude oil prices have tripled since 2000, and an index of food prices has doubled since the beginning of 2005 – have had a negative impact on aggregate demand and especially on aggregate supply and have resulted in a sharp and protracted increase in inflation. The financial market turbulence has led to a tightening of credit standards, an increase in financing costs and a deceleration of credit growth – though the severity of its impact on credit markets differs across countries. Moreover, the financial turmoil has adversely affected the profitability and the capital and liquidity positions of many financial institutions worldwide and in some cases it has caused severe distress or even the collapse of a number of banks. As a result of these developments, advanced industrial economies are experiencing the uncomfortable combination of weakening economic growth and increasing inflationary pressure. In addition, the macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by exceptionally high uncertainty, with risks to economic growth on the downside and risks to inflation clearly on the upside.  The effects of the commodity price shock and of the financial turmoil on the emerging market economies bear similarities, but also differences from their effects on advanced economies. Economic growth in some emerging or developing economies has also moderated somewhat but in most cases it remains fairly robust supported by domestic demand and the increased income of commodity exporting countries. On the inflation front, however, developments have been universally unfavourable. Average inflation in emerging (and developing economies) accelerated to 8.0% in the first half of this year from an average annual rate of 4.5% in 2006. Moreover, the economic and social impact of higher inflation is especially acute in those economies as food accounts for over 30% of the consumption basket of households, compared to less than 20% in Europe or in the US.  * * * Let me now focus on the economic and financial situation in Europe and, in particular, in the euro area economy of the 15 EU countries – to become 16 next year – that use the euro as their currency. As a result of the direct and indirect effects of the two shocks I referred to, economic growth in the euro area has moderated significantly this year, and indeed real GDP declined slightly by 0.2% in the second quarter. Part of this decline can be attributed to a technical reaction to the strong growth (of 0.7%) recorded in the first quarter. Nevertheless, economic activity is expected to remain subdued in the coming months and to gradually recover in the fourth quarter of this year and in the course of 2009. However, it is likely that the annual average rate of growth next year will be lower than previously expected.  Over the medium term, economic growth in the euro area should be underpinned by its sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances. Moreover, the implementation of reforms planned in a number of euro area countries should help raise productivity and potential output growth. However, the uncertainty surrounding the likely path of euro area economic activity in the coming quarters is unusually high and the risks to growth are on the downside. Among these risks, the potential impact of the financial market turmoil on the real economy could turn out to be larger and broader than currently expected. In addition, unanticipated increases in energy and other commodity prices cannot be excluded, despite the recent drop in prices, especially if demand from emerging economies remains strong.  Despite the significant weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008, inflation in the euro area has remained stubbornly high and well above the level that would be consistent with the ECB’s definition of price stability (an inflation rate of below but close to 2%). In July 2008, annual inflation reached 4.0%, having steadily risen from 2.1% in September 2007. This is largely due to the direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices globally. There are some indications, however, that domestic inflationary pressures are intensifying as labour cost growth has been increasing in the recent quarters. Looking forward, given the current futures prices for oil and other commodities, the annual inflation rate in the euro area is likely to remain significantly above the level consistent with price stability for a considerable period of time before declining only gradually in the course of 2009. With regard to the outlook for price developments, the main and serious concern is that a protracted period of high inflation, even if it is largely due to the direct and indirect effects of previous commodity price increases, has the potential to adversely affect price and wage-setting behaviour and short to medium-term inflation expectations, thereby inducing a wage-price spiral via broadly-based second-round effects. The likelihood of such an undesirable scenario should be avoided. For if it materialises, it will adversely and perversely affect growth and the purchasing power of households. Moreover, it will require a stronger degree of monetary tightening in order to achieve price stability in a sustained manner. This concern is further heightened by other upside risks to price stability. As I previously noted, notwithstanding the recent sharp decline in oil prices, the possibility of renewed increases cannot be excluded. In addition, despite some signs of moderation of growth in broad money and credit aggregates, the continued vigorous underlying pace of monetary expansion over the past few years confirms the existence of upside risks to price stability over a medium to longer term horizon. In order to address these upside risks and achieve price stability in the euro area over the medium-term, in accordance with the ECB’s mandate, the Governing Council raised the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in July. The Council decided to keep the interest rates unchanged at its August meeting. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will contribute to achieving our overriding objective of price stability and to maintaining medium and longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored to this objective. Looking forward, we will continue to monitor very closely all relevant developments and we will do what is necessary to ensure that price stability will be maintained over the medium term. It is evident from price developments in many countries that rising and persisting inflationary pressure is becoming a global phenomenon. Although from the perspective of individual countries or economic areas, the recent surge in inflation is mainly due to “external shocks” affecting oil and other commodity prices, in a global context these shocks are internal and reflect, to a considerable degree, aggregate demand pressures, particularly stemming from the growing demand for commodities by emerging and developing economies which account for the largest share of global demand growth for commodities. This in turn reflects the continuing strong growth in emerging market economies –which in some cases is driven by an expansion of aggregate demand that outstrips the growth in aggregate supply and is supported by accommodative monetary policies. The global inflation risk is that the indirect and potential second-round effects of external commodity price shocks on domestic prices and wages in individual countries can, if accommodated, help sustain inflationary pressure in these countries and elsewhere. It is, therefore, necessary to address the surge in global inflation by concerted efforts, especially by the monetary authorities in economies experiencing strong but unsustainable growth.  * * * Let me now conclude by elaborating on recent developments in financial markets and assessing their implications for the economic and financial stability outlook. As I previously stressed, some of the risks surrounding the economic outlook, globally and in Europe, stem from the ongoing financial turmoil, which has caused sizeable losses for banks in several advanced industrial economies and has resulted in increased financing costs and tighter credit market conditions. In fact, recent developments in the global financial markets point to a renewed intensification of the financial turbulence that commenced more than a year ago.  More specifically, tensions in the global term money markets are persisting despite several measures taken by central banks to improve the access of their counterparty financial institutions to funds so as to alleviate funding liquidity pressures. The spreads between the three-month deposit and the overnight index swap (OIS) rates have broadly stabilised, but at rather high levels ranging between 60 and 80 basis points in all major markets, including the euro area, the US and the UK. At the 12-month maturity, however, euro area money market spreads recently increased and exceeded 90 basis points. Before the turmoil erupted, these same spreads typically stood at around 5 basis points. These protracted pressures in the term money markets continue to have a considerable negative impact on the financing costs of those financial institutions which cover a large part of their funding needs in the short-term wholesale money market.  In the markets for asset-backed securities and structured credit products, where activity was booming and liquidity was abundant until August last year, new publicly-placed issuance has virtually dried up, except for the simpler securitised instruments backed by high-quality collateral. Moreover, the value of many of the outstanding complex structured products, including some of those backed by high-quality assets, has fallen in recent months. In the corporate credit markets, spreads in the below-investment grade segment have recently widened to the highest levels since the beginning of the turmoil. In addition, the cost of buying protection against the risk of default by some of the major financial institutions (as reflected in corporate credit default swaps spreads) has increased again, reaching levels comparable to those seen in late March, before the Bear Stearns rescue. In equity markets, the stock prices of non-financial firms have also declined sharply since early May, while (implied) stock market volatility rose to a peak in July and has remained high. These developments reflect market expectations of a deteriorating corporate earnings outlook, increased financing costs and high and volatile commodity prices.  Overall, a number of developments, both external to and within the euro area, suggest that the uncertainty surrounding the euro area financial stability outlook has increased. This assessment reflects to a considerable extent the continuing decline in US house prices, which is leading to a sharp rise in loan delinquencies and losses, and associated further declines in the prices of mortgage backed securities. In the euro area, credit risks have risen, stemming from developments in some housing markets as well as in those non-financial corporate sectors which are more exposed to residential construction activity. At the same time, however, there is little evidence so far to suggest that the availability of bank credit in the euro area as a whole has been significantly affected by these developments and, more generally, by the financial turmoil. In particular, the expansion of credit to the non-financial corporate sector remains strong, though moderating.  The persistence of the financial turmoil may also make the financial system more vulnerable to the crystallisation of other risks that have been previously identified by the ECB and other central banks and institutions. These include the possibility of a more broad-based turn in the global credit cycle, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and the financial stability implications of persistently elevated energy prices. It seems that large euro area banks have so far weathered the financial storm somewhat better than their global peers. Nevertheless, the investment losses suffered by some banks could make these institutions more vulnerable to a sharper deterioration in the credit cycle.  All in all, the outlook for both global and euro area financial stability remains highly uncertain. A lot will depend on the interaction between macroeconomic developments and the financial system and on how banks respond to an operating environment that presents various challenges, including some new ones. The financial turmoil could be gradually broadening in scope and evolve into a more traditional credit-cycle downturn. In such circumstances, it is likely that the adjustment process will remain protracted as key participants in the financial system continue their efforts to strengthen their liquidity and capital positions. In an environment where balance sheet conditions can change unexpectedly, there is obviously no room for complacency. Vigilance remains of the essence for market participants and policy makers.

Introduction [1]     Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Ronda and participate in the Summer School of the University of Málaga. I would like to thank the organisers, particularly Professors Amparo Ruiz Sepúlveda and David Bueno Vallejo, for giving me the opportunity to share with you some views on the relationship between financial systems, new technologies and productivity growth.  The notion that financial and economic activities are closely interrelated is not new. Indeed, it has a long tradition in economic theory. For instance, Clément Juglar – the French economist who was among the first to investigate the nature of business cycles – argued back in 1860 that economic fluctuations originate in the credit system. Financial development can have a significant impact on the economic performance of our economies. Indeed, developments in the financial system can directly influence productivity growth in the euro economy, since the financial sector accounts for a significant and growing share of output and employment in our economies. More generally, developments in the financial sector have an impact on economic performance well above their relative importance in employment or output. This is because financial services represent key intermediate inputs into other sectors of the economy, and thereby provide a very important contribution to productivity, innovation and economic growth in the long term. In fact, a well-functioning financial system enables an economy to exploit its full potential for output and employment growth.       2. Productivity growth in the financial system     Developments in the financial system can directly influence the performance of our economies, since the financial sector accounts for a significant and growing share of output and employment in the euro area. [2]  More generally, the increase in the relative importance of services in developed economies has been singled out as one of the potential explanations for the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over the last two decades (the so-called “Great Moderation”). In particular, the share of euro area total value added and employment accounted for by the services sector has significantly risen since the 1980s. As a result, the structure of the euro area economy has increasingly shifted away from traditional manufacturing industries towards services.  Within the services sector, over the last few decades there has been a slight increase in the importance of financial intermediation relative to other services sub-sectors. Data show that in 2005 financial and business services represented the sub-sector accounting for the largest share of value added. Their relative importance for employment is more limited, as a result of their relatively high productivity compared to other services sub-sectors.  Indeed, in contrast to other sub-sectors, financial services are substantially more exposed to international competition and the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Besides, the liberalisation of this sector started in the EU earlier than regulatory reforms in other services. As a result, the financial sector has been subjected to the combined of pressure of: (1) increased competition from capital markets and foreign financial institutions, and (2) earlier deregulation. The combination of technological progress and market structural changes should have spurred productivity growth in the euro area financial industry. Nevertheless, data from the EU KLEMS Growth and Productivity Accounts spanning the 1996-2005 period show that labour productivity growth in financial services was rather disappointing over this period, especially if compared with their corresponding performance in the US. Indeed, labour productivity growth of the financial sector was slightly negative in the euro area over this decade, while it outperformed the economy as a whole in the US.  Thus, in the euro area the financial services sector seems to have to some extent contributed to two important developments in labour productivity over this period: (1) the sharp slowdown in labour productivity growth in the euro compared to the period 1980-1995; (2) the emergence of a significant labour productivity growth gap between the euro area and the US.  Weak productivity developments in the financial services are also evident if we look at total factor productivity growth, a factor generally believed to have played a key role in determining the emergence of a significant output growth gap between the US and the euro area over 1996-2005. Indeed, over this period the financial services sector provided a significant negative contribution to euro area output growth, compared with a marginal positive contribution in the US. It should be noted that, while the negative rate of growth of TFP for this sector deteriorated in the euro area compared with the level observed over the period 1980-1995, over the same period the financial sector recorded a significant turnaround in the US. Developments across individual euro area countries were fairly mixed, but in the majority of cases TFP growth either improved at best only marginally or deteriorated significantly. Overall, the deterioration in the productivity performance of the euro area financial services industry, - and, more generally, the evidence of disappointing productivity performance also in other market-services sub-sectors making relatively intensive use of ICT - reflects insufficient technological and innovation spillovers as well as the negative impact of labour and market rigidities. From the policy point of view, these findings point to the need to continue implementing structural reforms, introducing measures aimed at increasing market competition and investing in education and human capital formation in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.      3. Financial sector and growth     Developments in the financial sector have an impact on economic performance well above their share in total employment or value added. [3] This is because the financial sector provides an important contribution to the efficient functioning of the entire economy, by ensuring that the most valuable real investment opportunities receive the necessary financing at a reasonable cost. In particular, a well-functioning financial system fosters saving and capital accumulation, allows for a more efficient spatial and inter-temporal allocation of resources, enhances risk-sharing and improves the diversification of risk. It can reduce the cost of capital as well as that of financial intermediation and improve competitiveness, thereby lowering prices and stimulating economic growth, job creation and welfare. Insofar as financial services are important for the economy as a whole and enable other economic transactions to run smoothly, they are associated with strong externalities affecting the rest of the economy.  The efficiency of a financial system typically depends on several key factors, including its degree of integration, market competition, level of development and innovation capacity. In particular, many studies have found evidence of a correlation between the level of financial development and the economic growth. [4] Indeed, there is a significant amount of empirical evidence derived from cross-country data showing that countries in which more credit to the private sector is extended typically experience stronger economic growth.  In standard neoclassical models, financial development fosters growth mainly by supporting a higher level of investment activity. Other models suggest that the positive influence of financial development may work through the accumulation of human capital (by supporting investment in education by individuals). However, recent studies have found evidence that in developed economies a more relevant channel through which financial intermediation affects economic growth may work through increases in total factor productivity. [5]  There is increasing interest in understanding the specific channels through which financial development affects productivity. Some studies have found out that this may be related to the superior ability of countries with more developed financial systems to finance investment for technological-related reasons or to enable firms to adopt new technologies more quickly. In addition, it has also been argued that finance fosters growth by stimulating “creative destruction”, in the words of Joseph Schumpeter, the famous Austrian economist who argued that fluctuations in investment and economic activity are determined by credit-financed innovation waves.  According to this argument, developed financial markets help to channel scarce capital from declining sectors to firms that are expected to grow faster and also make it easier for firm to enter industries facing good growth prospects. Hartmann et al. (2007) test this hypothesis for a group of 22 OECD countries and indeed find that in countries with more developed financial markets, industries with better growth prospects tend to benefit from more investment activity. [6]  How developed are the financial markets in the euro area? In order to answer this question, ECB staff members have developed aggregate measures of the size of stock, bond and loans markets that can be used as proxies for the degree of development of capital markets as a whole. [7] Based on these indicators, one can conclude that on average, capital markets in euro area countries tend to be smaller than those of the UK and US, and roughly comparable in size to those of Japan. It has been suggested that differences in the degree of development and, more generally, efficiency of capital markets may have played a role in explaining the better economic performance of the US relative to the euro area in the second half of the 1990s. [8] It should be noted though that there are significant differences across euro area countries, with the relative size of capital markets in some countries comparable or even bigger than in the Anglo-Saxon countries. Of course, one important difference between the capital markets of the euro area and other developed economies regards the relative importance of their market segments. In general, the euro area still has a much more “bank-based” system compared with the rather “market-based” system in the US. However, the euro area financial landscape is changing, as a result of a number of structural developments, including the introduction of the euro, increasing financial integration, securitisation and other forms of financial innovation, the impact of long-run demographic trends, etc.       4. Financial innovation     I have mentioned securitisation as one of the factors changing the euro area financial landscape. This is an important issue since securitisation is an example of a relatively mature form of financial innovation, a factor that plays an important role in determining the degree of efficiency of a financial system. Indeed, financial innovation can render financial markets more efficient by rendering them more complete, thereby allowing firms, households and governments to interact in the market place facing lower transaction costs, enhanced risk sharing instruments and contracting possibilities. I will concentrate on two specific examples of financial innovation: securitisation and the development of venture capital financing.     Securitisation    Securitisation – the practice of transforming formerly illiquid assets into portfolios of assets that can be sold widely – is particularly common in the banking sector. In fact, asset securitisation was introduced in the 1970s in the US precisely for the purpose to allow depository institutions to sell their pools of mortgage loans before maturity, thereby providing an additional source of funding. Banks subsequently extended the securitisation model to other forms of credit, such as consumer credit and student loans, that were historically regarded as highly illiquid. Increasing securitisation of lending-related assets, together with relentless financial innovation in credit markets, have led to the diffusion of a new business model – the “originate to distribute” model – among banks, particularly those of large size. Under this new model, banks originate loans but sell them to structured investment vehicles (often set up by themselves) to be repackaged and subsequently sold as asset-backed securities (ABSs).  In principle, this business model is attractive for banks since it provides them with a new source of financing to expand lending (thereby mitigating their funding liquidity risks), while also allowing them to economise on costly capital requirements. From the point of view of the economy as a whole, the “originate to distribute” model could be viewed as having many advantages. First, capital requirements are costly, thus the ability to sustain a given level of credit supply with a lower volume of capital enables the banking sector to reduce the costs of financing for borrowers. Moreover, it may be seen as representing a step towards more complete credit markets, thereby contributing to enhancing the efficiency of the economic system. In addition, the securitisation of loans in principle could reduce a secular source of vulnerability of the economies, by taking risk concentrations associated with loan portfolios away from the banking sector and spreading them more broadly across other sectors. As a result, the “originate to distribute” model may potentially diminish the likelihood of the credit busts and banking crises that have historically been a major source of macroeconomic and financial instability in many economies. I will come back to this point later on when talking about the implications of financial developments for financial stability. Following a relatively slow start compared to the US, the European market for structured finance products has grown rapidly during the last 5-10 years, often at double-digit rates. This development has been even more pronounced in the euro area compared with other regions due to a variety of factors, including the introduction of the single currency, further financial market integration through the use of credit derivatives and related financial instruments, and an innovative financial industry. [9] Growth in structured finance products has also been fuelled by high demand from investors stemming from the search for yield, in an environment of relatively low yields, and diversification opportunities. Securitisation has also been positively affected by the general move towards a more market-based financial system. Nevertheless, the volume of issuance of ABSs relatively to the size of the economy for the euro area as a whole remains lower than in the UK and the US, probably reflecting regulatory and legal barriers to financial integration. [10] Within the euro area, the countries in which the issuance of ABSs is more frequent are Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal.      Venture capital financing    Venture capital is a type of private equity investment provided by specialised investors as start-up money to finance new high-risk firms with large scope for growth (e.g. those involved in new technologies), in return for an equity position in the firm. [11] It represents an alternative source of capital financing, especially for those categories of firms (start-ups and small innovative firms) for which informational asymmetries are particularly pronounced, as it has been documented by the credit channel literature. Indeed, even bank financing may be difficult to obtain for such firms, as they are usually involved in high-risk businesses, but have little collateral to offer. Under a venture capital agreement, the investor acquires a significant equity stake in the firm, which provides him/her with the right incentive to monitor and control the firm and overcomes the potential asymmetric information problems. Venture capitalists also serve their portfolio firms by providing coaching and guidance, as well as networking for strategic alliances and further funding. Finally, venture capital financing is provided on a piecemeal basis over several stages, which reduces the entrepreneur’s incentive to skimp on effort during the early life of the firm.  It should be noted that providing financing to small and medium-sized enterprises is very important in the euro area because these categories of firms represent a significant component of the economies of many of its members. Thus, the financing of small- and medium-sized firms is crucial for fostering entrepreneurship, competition, innovation and growth in Europe. In addition, venture capital financing plays an important role in supporting the diffusion of new technologies in existing sectors and in fostering the developments of new industries. In that sense, venture capital is a type of finance which is ideally suited for the purpose of transforming scientific knowledge into commercial output. For instance, a recent study of the European biotech industry by ECB Staff has shown that venture capital financing increases the number of patent applications per unit of industrial R&D, suggesting that the involvement of venture capital investors makes R&D investment more efficient. [12]  Despite having grown substantially over the past ten years, venture capital financing in most euro area countries remains a fraction of venture capital financing in the UK or, especially, in the US. While average euro area venture capital financing in the late 1990s was larger than in the UK, this is no longer the case. Within the euro area, only Finland has levels of venture capital financing that can rival those of the United States. A second-tier group of countries (Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland and the Netherlands) have similar amounts of venture capital financing. Finally, early-stage venture capital financing remains limited in Austria, Greece, Italy and Spain.  It is not clear whether the apparent weakness of the European venture capital sector is caused by (1) a lack of capital supplied, perhaps reflecting lack of liquidity in still somewhat nationally segmented venture capital markets, (2) legal, regulatory and tax barriers, or (3) a shortage of viable exit options for venture capitalists through liquid specialised equity markets.       5. Implications for central banks    From the point of view of central banks, developments in the financial sector have a special role that distinguishes them from other services. In so far as financial developments influence the long term output and employment growth, they can affect the wide range of indicators and tools that central banks use to monitor and model the behaviour of the economy. More specifically, changes in the banking sector may affect the monetary transmission mechanism. A more developed and efficient financial system is likely to contribute to a more effective, harmonised and smooth transmission of the single monetary policy. In addition, the stability of the financial system is also a crucial concern for central banks and for the economy as a whole. In principle, deeper and more complete financial system should provide a number of social benefits, including better risk hedging and risk diversification that render economies less vulnerable to disturbances. However, there have long been concerns that some financial developments may lead to increased speculative behaviour, market volatility and, ultimately cause or exacerbate financial crises.  Securitisation provides an interesting illustration of how financial developments may influence the traditional monetary transmission mechanism and raise questions about financial stability.  As noted above, securitisation provides banks with a new source of financing and capital regulatory relief. Therefore, under normal macroeconomic conditions, one of the anticipated consequences of securitisation should be an overall increase in the aggregate supply of loans. [13] By affecting the ability and incentives of banks to grant credit, changes in securitisation activity are also likely to affect the way monetary policy is transmitted through credit markets. For instance, according to the “bank lending channel” theory, banks’ conditions can significantly affect how their supply of credit responds to monetary policy changes. In this respect, after a monetary tightening, the drop in the supply of credit is expected to be larger for small, less liquid and poorly capitalised banks. However, securitisation may weaken the effects of these factors on the transmission mechanism since (1) it may enable banks to provide additional lending without increasing the size of their balance sheets, (2) it allows them to obtain additional liquidity independently of their securities holdings, and (3) by removing loans from their balance sheet through securitisation, banks can improve their capital position on account of the transfer of credit risk. There is some evidence that the increase in securitisation may have reduced the impact of monetary policy changes through the “bank lending channel”, although this effect seems to be dependent on the economic cycle and other factors, such as bank risk. [14] However, this does not necessarily mean that the banking sector or the credit markets have become less relevant since they transmit monetary policy impulses through several other channels (notably, balance sheets). [15] Besides, securitisation affects banks in many different ways that may render them more sensitive to changes in monetary policy (e.g. by tightening the relationship between banks’ funding ability and conditions in wholesale capital markets).  An additional issue that has become rather topical over the past year is the potential impact of securitisation and the “originate-to-distribute” model on financial stability. As mentioned earlier, in principle the ability to securitise loans should enhance the banking sector and reduce the likelihood of the credit busts and banking crises that have historically posed a major threat to financial stability in many economies. However, even before the outbreak of the current financial market turmoil, some commentators have argued that, while securitisation certainly spreads existing risks, it may in fact encourage the creation of further risks, particularly by relaxing the incentives for banks to screen and monitor borrowers in order to alleviate the informational asymmetries associated with credit contracts. [16] In addition, it has been argued that the markets for securitised loans and credit derivatives may have failed to spread risks as effectively as expected and, by contrast, may have exacerbated information asymmetries, probably as a result of their opacity and the complexity of the underlying contracts. More generally, the recent turmoil has highlighted a number of weaknesses in the credit markets, namely in the areas of transparency, valuation, risk management practices, the current prudential framework and market functioning. However, a number of recommendations have been put forward by a wide range of fora and organisations (e.g. the Financial Stability forum) that should be fully implemented in order to restore the public’s confidence in the ability of securitisation to contribute to social welfare. To sum up, financial systems provide an important contribution to productivity, innovation and non-inflationary economic growth in the long term. Central banks have a keen interest in ensuring their orderly and efficient functioning since this is essential for the smooth conduct of monetary policy and for the safeguarding of financial stability.

Noch vor wenigen Jahrzehnten wäre eine einheitliche Währung in Europa für viele Beobachter undenkbar gewesen. Und doch feierten wir, wie Sie wissen, vor Kurzem das zehnjährige Bestehen der EZB und somit auch des ESZB, des Europäischen Systems der Zentralbanken. Seit der Einführung des Euro im Januar\\xa01999 konzentriert sich die EZB auf die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität im Euroraum, ihr vorrangiges Ziel. Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour and a pleasure to be invited here today to speak about the current state of the euro area and its future. Not many decades ago, a single currency in Europe would have been unthinkable for many observers. And yet, as you know, we have just celebrated the tenth anniversary of the creation of the ECB and, for that matter, the ESCB\\xa0– the European System of Central Banks. Since the launch of the euro in January 1999, the ECB has focused on preserving price stability in the euro area, its primary objective.  You all know very well that inflation rates have continued to rise since the autumn of last year. Inflation is expected to remain above the level consistent with price stability for longer than we previously thought. Last week we had to act to discourage second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to delivering price stability over the medium term. As I will argue in my talk today, a lot depends on the solidly anchoring of inflation expectations. Over the last ten years, the ECB has gained a great deal of respect and credibility. Since the launch of the euro, the average inflation rate has been just slightly above 2%. And this has been achieved, despite various shocks that have hit the euro area over these years, including the ongoing strong global increase in commodity prices that is affecting Europe and the rest of the world. In the decades before the launch of the euro, average annual inflation rates in many EU Member States were very significantly higher. This is a remarkable result. It shows that we have inherited the credibility that was the privilege of the most successful currencies before the euro. Today, I would like to share with you some of our achievements over these past ten momentous years. They call for celebration. But over and beyond our performance in terms of price stability, I would also like to share with you reflections on the economic performance of the euro area and some of the remaining challenges that the ECB and the euro area as a whole face as they enter their second decade. I will then make a few remarks on the sound economic management of our Monetary Union.       1. On the achievements of the euro area    The new monetary policy framework – with the ECB setting the monetary policy for the entire euro area – was quickly understood and trusted from the very first days. The ECB has a clear mandate – to safeguard price stability in the euro area – and is independent. In 2003, the ECB clarified that price stability meant maintaining inflation rates close to and below 2% over the medium term. This is a clear yardstick against which the public can judge us. While being custodian of the trust of the citizens of the euro area, we are also fully accountable to them, and endeavour to explain our actions. Over these ten years, this framework has contributed to anchoring longer-term inflation expectations.  We all know that price stability is essential for the success of a large economic and monetary union. It protects the incomes of all of us, and particularly those of the most vulnerable and poorest of our fellow citizens. An aspect that is often neglected is that, thanks to price stability, diverse other benefits follow. Price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth and job creation and, ultimately, social cohesion. [1] It is also a major contribution for financial stability. The euro also promotes the functioning of our vast continental market and, therefore, helps bring about a true single market for goods, services, capital and labour. During the first nine years of the euro, 15.7 million new jobs were created in the euro area, and the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since the early 1980s. Our common currency has also helped to protect the euro area economy from diverse global shocks, as well as from the considerable turbulence of the last few years. Let me offer you two examples of the credibility of the ECB and the benefits that this brings.     Over recent months, we have seen that actual inflation may temporarily diverge from our medium-term objective. The  first example  of the credibility of the ECB is that long-term inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored. In fact, they have remained well anchored over the entire ten years. This is remarkable considering the series of adverse economic disturbances that have hit the euro area since its inception.    The  second example  of the credibility of the ECB is that medium and long-term market rates of the euro are at the same low levels in terms of embedded inflation expectations and risk premia as those experienced by the most stable national currencies prior to it. In other words, we have been instrumental in securing the lowest market interest rates on a 5, 10 up to 50-year basis. Most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation which has also supported fiscal consolidation. [2]     The euro has also helped strengthen trade and financial linkages across euro area countries. There is clear evidence that the introduction of the single currency and the associated increase in price and cost transparency have fostered both intra and extra-euro area trade in goods and services. In fact, the sum of intra-euro area exports and imports increased from about 31% of GDP in 1998 to around 40% in 2007 – approximately 9 percentage points. During the same period, extra-euro area trade growth even exceeded that in intra-euro area trade, rising 13 percentage points from 31% to 44% of GDP in 2007. Hence, there is no “fortress Europe”.  Let me also mention that, when I travel around Europe, I feel that a shift in mindset is gradually taking place. In fact,  firms  are becoming more conscious of the euro area dimension of their actions and decisions.  Households  are increasingly conscious of the opportunities offered by an expanded economic and financial area.  The launch of the euro has also coincided with a remarkable deepening of financial integration. The financial landscape has already changed a great deal in most market segments, and is continuing to change. The euro is acting as a catalyst for a gradual portfolio reallocation away from holdings of domestic financial instruments towards holdings of financial instruments issued elsewhere within the euro area. For instance, euro area cross-border holdings of long-term debt securities have increased strongly – from about 10% of total stocks at the end of the 1990s to nearly 60% in 2006. Furthermore, euro area residents almost doubled the amount of cross-border holdings of equity issued by euro area residents, from 15% to 29%, between 1997 and 2006, in particular on account of institutional investors. As for capital flows, the euro has boosted foreign direct investment – particularly cross-border mergers and acquisitions in manufacturing – and portfolio flows across euro area countries. Well-integrated financial markets and diversified portfolios reduce the extent to which the saving and spending decisions of firms and households are dependent on economic and financial developments in a specific country, region or sector. As a result, credit and risk-sharing channels are increasingly helping to attenuate the impact of shocks in a specific euro area country or sector. Let me mention also one important aspect. We live in an era of rapid technological progress. Competitive forces are reshaping global manufacturing, the financial landscape and the sharing of wealth. Large demographic changes are also under way. The impact of these “mega-trends” is very substantial, although it is difficult to quantify them precisely.  In my view, the euro area as a whole has exhibited resilience to such external developments. It is, as a whole, significantly more resilient than many of its individual member countries were before the launch of the euro [3]. The euro area has been a source of stability.   In short, the current state of the euro area is one of increasing interdependence and ongoing integration. Over these ten years, we have observed greater price stability, greater macroeconomic stability, as well as increasing economic and financial integration. However, despite these achievements, there is no room for complacency, and a great deal still needs to be accomplished. I now want to put forward the argument that several changes in this second decade and beyond will have to come from the “E” in EMU: namely that there is a need for further substantial efforts and reforms on the economic side. In other words, I argue that there is a need for a sound economic management. This has two facets. The first is that the overall level of economic performance in the euro area needs to improve. Think, for example, of the question as to how the euro area as a whole might raise its potential growth…and actually grow at such a higher level. The second facet is that we need to understand and address diversity of economic performance across the euro area. Think, for example, of the question as to the extent to which euro area countries differ in terms of economic performance. I will deal with these aspects in turn.       2. On the economic performance of the euro area    The achievements I have just described have accompanied an impressive performance in terms of job creation. From the start of EMU to the end of last year, as I have already mentioned, the number of people in employment in the euro area has increased by 15.7 million, compared with an increase of only some 5 million in the previous nine years, and the euro area unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s. Of course, the surge in employment cannot be attributed solely to the euro. It also reflects corporate restructuring, the progress made on structural reforms and overall wage moderation in most countries.  However, Europe is far from having exhausted its potential for further increases in labour participation rates and employment. Let me flag just a few facts. The overall employment rate in the euro area remains modest by international standards – 65.7% in the euro area, compared with 72% in the United States – and the unemployment rate is still clearly too high – over 7% in the euro area. More specifically, while the employment rate of prime-age men in the euro area is comparable with that in the United States, considerable disparities remain when we look at employment rates among the young, among women and among older workers. [4]  Labour market reforms appear to be even more appropriate if we consider that growth performance will increasingly be constrained by relatively low population growth rates and population ageing. Since the early 1990s, the population of the euro area has been growing at a yearly rate of only 0.4%, compared with 1.1% in the United States.   Europe has room to develop its growth potential.  Since the early 1990s, real GDP has grown, on average, by 2.1% in the euro area, compared with 2.8% in the United States. Since the start of EMU, the annual growth rate for the euro area has averaged 2.2% per year, compared with 2.7% in the United States. Even if one has to recognise that the euro area did slightly better than the US in terms of GDP growth per capita, it remains that the euro area’s potential output growth has moved to the lower bound of its previously estimated range of 2-2.5%. A low trend growth in labour productivity explains, in large part, the modest growth performance. During the 1980s, hourly labour productivity in the euro area grew, on average, by 2.3%, while it declined to 1.8% in the 1990s and decreased further to 1.2% between 1999 and 2007. By contrast, hourly labour productivity growth in the United States accelerated from 1.2% to 1.6% and then to 2.1% over the same periods. [5]   What can be done to enhance labour productivity? In recent years, we have seen rising levels of employment, particularly in the unskilled segment of the labour market. This has certainly contributed to the slowdown in labour productivity growth. However, to a large extent, there has also been a significant slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP) growth. TFP growth is generally taken as a measure of technological progress and improvement in the organisation and overall efficiency of production. [6] There are many factors behind the low growth in TFP. Unfortunately, most European economies do not incorporate appropriate incentives to invest in real and human capital, to innovate and raise the flexibility and adaptability of firms when their environment changes. [7]   To sum up, the remarkable labour market performance observed in the euro area since its creation could even be improved upon. Rising productivity must also contribute to enhancing the overall economic performance of the euro area as a whole. While the ECB sets monetary policy by looking at the performance of the euro area as a whole, the ECB also follows closely what happens in all euro area countries. In other words, we also look at diversity of economic performance across the euro area.      3. Diversity in EMU    Some diversity – in economic and financial developments – is a natural phenomenon in any vast currency area. [8] Rates of economic growth, inflation and changes in labour costs can differ across countries for various reasons. Some of these reasons may have no link whatsoever with monetary policy or a single currency. For instance, diversity might originate from country-specific demographic trends or from their catching-up in terms of living standards. There could also be national differences in areas such as industry characteristics, investment in research and development (R&D), and innovation. Differences in the timing and extent of past structural reforms in euro area countries are also a source of diversity. [9]  Differences in fiscal policies and other national policies can also give rise to diverse economic situations. There is an additional source of diversity due to the one-off shock constituted by the launch of the euro that may currently be working its way through the system. Some countries suddenly benefited from lower short and long-term interest rates, as well as from easier access to more competitive credit markets. This encouraged the purchase of durable and non-durable goods, as well as housing, albeit to differing extents, in the various euro area countries.    But let’s put diversity in perspective.  Over these ten years, the degree of diversity observed in the euro area at each point in time did not appear to be substantially different from that seen in the United States. Nor is it substantially different from that seen within the national borders of some large economies (such as Germany, Italy and Spain). However, a distinct feature of diversity in the euro area is its persistence over long periods of time. In other words, diversity in most euro area countries displays significant inertia. Let me briefly look at three types of diversity.   a) Inflation dispersion in the euro area declined considerably in the 1980s and 1990s and is now on a par with inflation dispersion in the United States. To give you an example, the unweighted standard deviation of annual HICP inflation rates still stood at around 6 percentage points in late 1990, but – since the launch of the euro – this rate has broadly stabilised at around 1 percentage point. This dispersion level is similar to that of the 14 US metropolitan statistical areas, but is somewhat higher than that of the four US census regions. Hence, impressive progress has been made, and I would argue that, prima facie, inflation dispersion in the euro area is not high by international standards. However, inflation differentials in the euro area are very persistent; in this respect, the euro area does indeed differ from the United States. Most euro area countries that have exhibited higher than average inflation rates in recent years have been in this position for at least a decade. These include Spain and Greece. Similar persistence – but on the opposite side – is observed in low-inflation countries such as Germany. Only in some euro area countries, such as Portugal and the Netherlands, have differentials moved from being relatively high to being in line with – or even below – the euro area average. Such corrections are welcome, but the point is that they are slow to materialise. If we look at the cost side, the factors generating inflation differentials are, in most countries, primarily domestic rather than external. In particular, we have witnessed sustained divergence in wage developments across the euro area and smaller differences in labour productivity growth. These differences in the growth of labour costs have been the main sources of persistence in inflation differentials. Various reasons can be suggested for this. Varying levels of wage rigidity across the euro area, changes in profit margins, imperfect competition and associated price rigidities across countries all affect labour costs and contribute to inflation differentials. If we look at product groups, price dispersion has been greater in the field of services, mostly owing to the dispersion observed in wage developments across countries. By contrast, inflation dispersion has been relatively low for tradable non-energy industrial goods, with greater competition in tradable goods being the main reason for this. Products with relatively volatile prices (such as energy and food) have, on the other hand, shown high levels of dispersion across countries in terms of price changes.  b) Output growth differentials in the euro area have remained broadly stable since the early 1970s. No signs of increased annual divergence were observed between 1999 and 2007. The average dispersion of annual real GDP growth over this period (measured as the unweighted standard deviation) was around 2 percentage points. This figure is very close to the average dispersion of real growth rates since the 1980s. By comparison, if we look across all 50 US States, the dispersion of real growth has averaged approximately 2.5 percentage points over the last 15 years. When the United States is divided into the eight statistical regions, the average dispersion shrinks to around 1.5 percentage points. One issue of concern, however, is the fact that within the euro area there is also a relatively high degree of persistence regarding output growth differentials. This is less the case in the United States. However, taking the United States as a benchmark only helps up to a point. On the one hand, the US economy is known to be more flexible than the euro area, which means that the effects of asymmetric shocks can be absorbed more easily and more quickly. On the other hand, the United States exhibits stronger regional specialisation than the euro area, making its regions more susceptible to specific asymmetric shocks. Let me now turn to the two main drivers of growth differentials in the euro area: differentials in cycles and differentials in trends. Differentials in cycles have declined steadily since the early 1990s. There is also evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle accounting for a large part of the business cycle fluctuations across euro area countries. Since 1999, several shocks have spread in similar ways across euro area countries. For example, the euro area has successfully weathered several shocks, including the bursting of the dotcom bubble, the ripple effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the surge in global commodity prices – particularly energy prices – and the persistence of sizeable global imbalances. The high degree of synchronisation in the business cycles of euro area countries is a feature unique to the euro area. This suggests that EU integration and, more recently, the launch of the euro – rather than global forces\\xa0– have led to smaller differences in output gaps among euro area countries. The picture for the second driver of dispersion – namely differentials in trends – shows more lasting differences since the beginning of the 1990s, with a gradual increase in trend growth dispersion. This picture also differs across euro area countries, some of which persistently exhibit trend output growth either above or below the euro area average. It is here that the various sources of diversity that I have mentioned play a role.  c) Changes in cost and price competitiveness mainly reflect changes in relative unit labour costs and persistent inflation differentials. These demonstrate that there is significant leeway for influencing competitiveness, even in the absence of nominal exchange rate adjustments. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this leeway, if we consider the cumulative growth of unit labour costs for the economy as a whole between 1999 and 2007, the difference between the countries with the largest increases and those with the smallest increases was around 20 to 30%. This is an important phenomenon, and a close examination of the driving factors is therefore required. Germany, for example, has seen moderate growth in unit labour costs over an extended period, leading to a correction of the losses in competitiveness that arose in the aftermath of German reunification. This correction – and the corresponding sustained period of relatively low inflation – is, of course, fully justified and most welcome. It also shows that adjustment mechanisms in the euro area work. A higher degree of wage flexibility would help to accelerate such desirable adjustment processes.  At the other extreme, some countries may, to some extent, be catching up with others’ higher living standards. These countries are, therefore, possibly experiencing some temporary differences in competitiveness, reflecting movement towards a new equilibrium. Some other sources of persistent inflation differentials, however, might not be justifiable – for example, differentials attributable to insufficient flexibility. In some economies, weak labour productivity growth and strong increases in nominal wages and salaries over a sustained period inevitably result in a loss of competitiveness.  To sum up, diversity in terms of inflation and cost developments is undesirable when it reflects structural rigidities or a lack of competition. While we see evidence of a stronger common euro area cycle, we also see diversity in national trend growth. Monetary policy has a limited role in addressing such diversity. Changes in competitiveness are unfolding faster than was foreseen prior to the launch of the euro, which is good in some respect because it means that necessary adjustments in relative competitiveness can be more rapid. But it also suggests that a lucid monitoring of competitive indicators is of the essence to avoid possible rapid losses of relative competitiveness inside the euro area.       4. There is thus a clear need for sound economic management in EMU    The future of the euro area will rely as much on consolidating its achievement as in meeting some future challenges. I will argue now that the increasing interdependence among euro area economies, combined with the need to raise the level of economic performance while addressing excessive differentials in inflation, growth and competitiveness, requires sound economic management. Let me now stress the importance of four guiding principles in this respect.  a) The first principle is the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact as a prerequisite for sound fiscal policies   There are several reasons for supporting sound fiscal policies. They are needed, for instance, to reduce the risk of fiscal policy spillover, both into monetary policy and, more generally, across countries. They are also needed to enhance flexibility and adaptability. Sound fiscal policies create the necessary conditions for flexibility, which cushions the effects of the economic cycle through the functioning of automatic stabilisers. Sound fiscal policies also ensure proper incentives. The tax and benefit system should avoid major distortions that affect incentives to work, save, invest and innovate, thereby making fiscal policy more efficient and growth-friendly. Moreover, the public sector also functions as a role model as regards, for example, wages or administrative prices. [10] Importantly, sound fiscal policies must also make provisions for the effects of population ageing.  b) The second principle for a sound economic management pertains to the full completion of the Single Market. This will enhance not only competition and efficiency, but also adjustment mechanisms in the event of adverse shocks. We still have significant progress to make in this domain, despite the fact that the Single Market was the goal of the founding fathers of the European Union, as set out in the Treaty of Rome, and despite the fact that this 50-year endeavour was very strongly reaffirmed with the Single European Act 20 years ago. According to the OECD, product market regulation remains high in several euro area countries, and the level of such regulation in the euro area as a whole is considered significantly higher than in the United States. Let me also mention the fact that the services sector, which represents 70% of euro area GDP, is far from being fully integrated as an effective single market. We attach enormous importance to the full integration of financial markets, particularly because these play a decisive role in shock absorption and adjustment dynamics in a large single currency area. As far as cross-border labour mobility is concerned, empirical evidence suggests that it is still low in the euro area – both across countries and within countries – on account of several formal barriers across the euro area. This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States, where labour mobility is considerable and greatly contributes to the adjustment process. Hence, more needs to be done to enhance labour mobility in Europe.  c) The third principle for a sound economic management is the need to closely monitor the implementation of structural reforms. Earlier I referred to some structural factors commonly contributing to inflation and growth differentials, as well as to disappointing growth in productivity. These detrimental factors include pervasive price and wage rigidities, excessive labour market regulation and the imperfect competition observed in several important sectors.  This has been recognised for quite some time. It is widely acknowledged that reforms are essential in order to raise factor productivity and potential output, to create new jobs, to achieve lower prices and higher real incomes, and to increase the resilience and flexibility of the economy. Yet, experience to date has clearly shown how difficult it is to undertake reforms in practice. [11] We have to persist and I shall flag some specific initiatives for reform in three main areas, namely: [12]   (1) Getting more people into work: Despite impressive achievements in job creation thus far, the still relatively high unemployment rates in the euro area (as well as the low participation rates in some countries) clearly suggest there is a need to stimulate not only labour supply but also labour demand. As regards labour demand, there is a need to reduce labour market rigidities as they restrict wage differentiation and flexibility, and thus tend to discourage the hiring of younger and older workers, in particular. Progress towards greater contractual flexibility must continue to improve in several euro area countries. Moreover, in those European countries where competitiveness has declined, or where the unemployment rate remains high, it is important that wage increases do not fully exhaust productivity gains. This in order to provide incentives for firms to create additional jobs. [13] Finally, as regards labour supply, further reforms in income tax and benefit systems would help to increase people’s incentives to work.   (2) Increasing competition: Establishing efficient and well-functioning product and service markets can boost productivity trends by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate, supports further employment creation, reduces inflation persistence and keeps upward price pressures contained, thereby improving the adjustment capacity of countries. “Little else than productivity growth matters in the long-run” – as Bob Solow [14] once put it. It is undeniable that, over the past two decades, significant progress has already been made in the context of the Single Market Programme. This has already yielded major benefits for European economies. [15] However, the extension and deepening of the Single Market still remains a high priority as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive. [16]   (3) Supporting an innovative environment: The reforms that I have mentioned need to be accompanied by measures supporting innovation through higher investment in research and development and policies geared towards improving human capital. Europe needs many new and dynamic firms that are willing to reap the benefits of opening markets and to pursue creative or innovative ventures. Notably, it is new and smaller firms – rather than large ones – that are the job creators. This requires an entrepreneur-friendly environment with less “red tape”, and easier access to the finance these firms need. Europe is lagging significantly behind in this field; its venture capital financing, for instance, remains only a fraction of that in the United States, relative to the size of its economy. We know that research and development, as well as human capital, make valuable contributions to TFP growth. In 2006, R&D investment relative to GDP was only 1.9% in the euro area, compared with 2.7% in the United States. [17] Cooperation between universities, public sector research institutes and industry must also intensify to raise the efficiency of public R&D spending. Unfortunately, in several euro area countries, investment in human capital is still too low for a “knowledge-intensive” economy. Instead, the employability and flexibility of the labour force requires human capital to be continuously adjusted to labour market needs. This investment should start “early” by enhancing the quality and efficiency of our schools and universities, and be continued through lifelong training and learning.  d) The fourth principle for a sound economic management is the need to monitor unit labour costs and national competitiveness indicators so as to prevent or correct abnormal deviations. We would expect some dispersion and differentials among euro area countries. As I have already mentioned, in such a vast area, there will always be some diversity, as in the United States. Countries catching up in terms of GDP per capita and price levels are always likely to have stronger output growth and higher inflation. Diversity may also extend to correcting past excesses in terms of overall cost and price competitiveness, particularly in the markets for tradable goods and services. In such situations, national governments and social partners need to take action to address excessive wage developments and to strengthen productivity growth, so that unit labour costs in those economies increase less rapidly than the euro area average.  To sum up, this sound economic management can foster economic stability and growth, as well as reduce the impact of adverse shocks, or facilitate the adjustment thereafter. The attentive monitoring of economic and financial developments, and of changes in competitiveness in particular, must be an integral part of this economic management. The public’s understanding and acceptance of these elements is also crucial. That is why we always strive to explain what actions we are undertaking, and why. *** Ladies and gentlemen, let me now conclude. The past ten momentous years have been rich in achievements. The introduction of the euro has been recognised as a remarkable success. Since 1999, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies prior to the euro. Inflation expectations are well anchored, and medium and long-term interest rates in the euro area are at the same low level as the levels observed for the most credible of these former national currencies. We also see a remarkable degree of resilience in a complex international environment. These achievements are a solid foundation for our future. But we also know that the challenges lying ahead for the euro area are still demanding. What do we need to do, over the next ten years and beyond, to consolidate the remarkable success of the euro and improve the performance of euro area economies? We, at the ECB and the Eurosystem, must preserve the quality of our monetary policy. This will safeguard all the benefits expected of price stability in terms of low current and expected inflation and interest rates. To strengthen the “E” in EMU, we need to focus on a sound economic management and we need to secure a broad base of acceptance for it. This entails: a rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact; the completion of the Single Market; the implementation of the structural reforms envisaged in the Lisbon agenda; and a careful monitoring of national unit labour costs and competitiveness indicators. The achievements that I have described and the visible benefits of the euro support this sound economic management. These achievements and benefits help national governments to adapt and further liberalise their economies. Thank you for your attention.      Selected references    Anderton, R., F. di Mauro and F.

Let me also remind you that empirical evidence shows there is a negative relationship between inflation and output growth, with a 100-basis point permanent increase in inflation being associated with a 10 to 30-basis point decrease in trend output growth (see the May 2008 issue of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin).    [2] After the transition to the euro, the yield curve was fully in line with the benchmark set by the most credible currencies before EMU. As a result, in some euro area countries, medium and long-term market interest rates fell to unprecedented levels when the euro was introduced and have remained there since. This is a phenomenal benefit. In fact, most euro area countries have benefited from significantly better financing conditions than in the 1990s, a situation that has supported fiscal consolidation. For instance, in the run-up to Stage Three of EMU, fiscal deficits were reduced considerably, mainly on account of falling interest payments, from an average of 5.2% of GDP between 1990 and 1998 to 3.4% between 1999 and 2007 (see ECB, “10th Anniversary of the ECB”, Special Edition of the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, June 2008).    [3] Not so long ago, the impact of movements of the Deutsche Mark against the US dollar was often aggravated by similar movements between the currencies that have now been replaced by the euro. This can no longer happen. This increasing resilience is illustrated by the fact that the major shocks of the last ten years have not played an important role in the dispersion of output growth. In other words, they have not contributed to the economic diversity that I will now go on to discuss.    [4] In 2007, for instance, the female employment rate was 58% in the euro area, compared with 66% in the United States in 2006; among older workers, it was 43.3%, compared with 61.7% in the United States in 2006, while the youth employment rate was 38%, compared with 54.2% in the United States in 2006. In the case of the euro area, these features appear to be consistent with an “insider-outsider” characterisation of the European labour market, where structural impediments resulting from the legal and regulatory environment, high taxes on labour and rigidities associated with wage regulations may prevent those groups “at the margin” from actively participating in the labour market.    [5] Euro area data on hours worked per worker in 2007 are assumed to be constant. US data on hours worked per worker are estimated using OECD data for 2006 and 2007. The source of the data is the AMECO database.    [6] According to the European Commission, total factor productivity grew, on average, by 1.6% in the 1980s, before falling to 1.1% in the 1990s and to 0.7% between 1999 and 2007. The countries that have managed to exploit the efficiency gains resulting, in particular, from new technology have enjoyed stronger labour productivity growth. For instance, in the last ten years, investment in information and communication technology in the United States was double that of the euro area. According to the EUKLEMS database, the average contribution from ICT capital to total economic growth in the euro area was 0.4\\xa0percentage point over the period 1995-2005, while in the United States it averaged 0.8 percentage point over this same period.    [7] It appears that the structural characteristics of the best-performing industrialised economies, namely more flexible labour markets, greater competition in product markets and lower barriers to entry for new firms have been more receptive to the opportunities provided by new technologies.    [8] Diversity is sometimes referred to as heterogeneity or divergences: in my view, diversity might be more appropriate in most cases because a significant degree of dispersion looks like not a defect but a fundamental feature of any vast continental economy like the US or the euro area.    [9] An example of this is the Netherlands, which undertook labour market reforms far earlier than the largest euro area countries. This enhanced the country’s flexibility and increased its ability to adjust to a wide range of shocks. In other countries, short-term shocks may have had more persistent effects on growth differentials owing to slow adjustment processes caused by the presence of structural rigidities.    [10] The behaviour of the public sector can, for instance, make social partners more aware of the trade-off between higher salaries and job creation. Furthermore, population ageing in most industrialised economies – and a significant increase in the old-age dependency ratio and higher healthcare and long-term care expenditures will exert growing pressure on public finances.    [11] The need for structural reforms was highlighted by the Lisbon agenda of 2000, which represents a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw Europe’s attention to the major areas where changes are required. More recently, the Lisbon agenda has been refocused in the direction of growth and employment. Various attainable objectives have been set in order to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of labour markets, to raise competition in markets for goods and services, to increase employment, to promote innovation and to strengthen growth and employment rates in all participating countries.    [12] These topics are clearly reflected in the Integrated Guidelines for the new phase of the Lisbon Strategy and the recommendations for the euro area. We appreciate the renewed impetus toward reforms by some governments, which has now resulted in the more focused “Partnership for Growth and Jobs” and in the structural reform commitments of the national reform programmes. We also need to reinforce the benchmarking of good performance in order to identify with greater accuracy the areas where reform challenges are most urgent.    [13] In this context, the Governing Council considers that features that enforce wage rigidity and lead to non-optimal wage-setting, in particular, and the indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index, should be avoided. This is especially relevant today, with the risk of second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wages. Avoiding these practices is essential to preserve price stability in the medium term and, in turn, the purchasing power of all euro area citizens.    [14] See the introductory article of the special issue on the slowdown in productivity growth in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 2, No\\xa04, 1988,.    [15] The European Commission recently estimated that the Single Market had created 2.75 million jobs and had brought about an increase in welfare of €518 per head in 2006, corresponding to a 2.15% increase in EU GDP over the period 1992-2006 (see European Commission, “The single market: review of achievements”, November 2007).    [16] Understandably, for the ECB, further European financial integration is essential given its relevance to the conduct of the single monetary policy. Considerable progress has already been made across various market segments. Financial integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy. While the euro area banking markets for wholesale and capital market-related activities have shown clear signs of increasing integration since the introduction of the euro, the retail banking segment has remained more fragmented, leaving European firms and consumers unable to take full advantage of EMU and the Single Market.    [17] While many Member States expect to increase their spending in this area, the EU will fall short of its overall target of 3% of GDP by 2010. Increasing investment in research and development is not, of course, an objective in itself. If we want to see an impact on growth, it is also the return on that R&D that matters.    ']\n",

Los responsables de las políticas económicas en todo el mundo están realizando grandes esfuerzos por entender las causas fundamentales, la duración y la repercusión de una serie de perturbaciones de dimensiones considerables, que están afectando vivamente a la economía mundial, entre ellas el aumento de los precios de las materias primas —con las fuertes subidas de los precios del petróleo y de los alimentos como principal componente— y el prolongado período de turbulencias financieras asociadas al reajuste de la percepción del riesgo en los mercados financieros.  Entender estas perturbaciones y la forma en que afectan a la economía constituye, sin duda, un reto de enorme importancia para las autoridades económicas. En mi intervención de hoy, quisiera subrayar el hecho de que la economía mundial en la que vivimos no se enfrenta a una única corrección profunda con una sola causa, sino a múltiples perturbaciones interdependientes en diversos sectores esenciales. Comprender adecuadamente la naturaleza de estas perturbaciones y sus interrelaciones es una condición necesaria para valorar adecuadamente y decidir las respuestas que han de ofrecer las políticas económicas y, en particular, la política monetaria.      Un entorno complejo y cambiante    Es indudable que los avances de la ciencia y la aceleración del progreso tecnológico resultan fundamentales para desentrañar las fuerzas que guían la presente evolución de la economía mundial. Pero también es hoy evidente que otros muchos elementos entran asimismo en juego, como queda patente al considerar los factores determinantes del acusado aumento de los precios mundiales de las materias primas registrado recientemente. Tras algunos de estos factores asoma lo que podríamos calificar como un cambio en nuestro “entorno operativo de referencia”. Frente a un mundo en el que los recursos parecían inagotables, la humanidad se está acostumbrando de forma gradual a la idea de que la Tierra es limitada en recursos, está superpoblada y ofrece un espacio finito. Los recursos que se pueden explotar tienen un límite y la capacidad para absorber y reciclar residuos o contaminación es limitada todavía. La economía de ese mundo, que pugna con ímpetu creciente por ampliar los límites del desarrollo, exige reajustar nuestras perspectivas y reconocer la complejidad de las interacciones en el sistema mundial.  Si nos centramos específicamente en la evolución de los precios de las materias primas agrícolas, el continuo crecimiento de la población y la mejora de los niveles de vida están ejerciendo viva presión sobre la capacidad de suministro alimentario en todo el planeta. Al mismo tiempo, el crecimiento de las economías emergentes ha impulsado la demanda de energía y materias primas industriales, lo que se ha manifestado de manera especialmente evidente en la subida de los precios del petróleo. Paralelamente, la preocupación cada vez mayor por las consecuencias de las emisiones procedentes de la utilización de combustibles fósiles en el cambio climático ha avivado la demanda de fuentes de energía alternativas potencialmente más limpias, como los biocombustibles, dando lugar a una sustitución de los cultivos con fines alimentarios hacia los cultivos que podemos llamar “energéticos”, intensificando todavía más las presiones sobre los precios de los alimentos. Existen otros factores que están incidiendo asimismo en el comportamiento de los precios mundiales de las materias primas. Por ejemplo, las perturbaciones de la oferta causadas por las condiciones meteorológicas desfavorables también han agudizado la escasez de alimentos. Y las diferencias en las condiciones de competitividad de los sectores de comercio minorista y de distribución han contribuido a que la variación de los precios de la energía y de los alimentos siguiera trayectorias divergentes entre distintos países. Este ejemplo sirve para ilustrar la afirmación de que las actuales perturbaciones que afronta la economía mundial no pueden considerarse aisladamente, y que las interacciones entre ellas son diversas y numerosas.  Naturalmente, la presión sobre los precios mundiales de las materias primas no es más que una de las facetas del proceso de globalización que afecta a la evolución económica. Sin embargo, no podemos ofrecer un panorama coherente de las repercusiones de dicho proceso sin reconocer también los efectos moderadores de la inflación asociados a la contención de los precios de las importaciones de productos manufacturados y al aumento de la competencia internacional en los mercados de mano de obra durante los últimos años. En particular, la intensificación del comercio con países de costes bajos y el aumento de la cuota de importaciones provenientes de dichos países en todo el mundo han ejercido presiones a la baja sobre los precios de importación de productos manufacturados en las economías desarrolladas durante la pasada década. El efecto neto de estas fuerzas de signo contrario resulta difícil de evaluar y, además, varía en función del país. Sin embargo, parece haber surgido un consenso provisional entre los economistas y el mundo académico, según el cual, en el pasado reciente, el efecto general de la globalización habría consistido en una moderación neta, probablemente pequeña y poco significativa, de la inflación de la zona del euro. Las perspectivas de futuro son quizás más inciertas. Recientemente han aparecido signos claros de que el impacto moderador de la inflación de los países de bajos costes sobre los precios de importación de la zona del euro, en caso de existir, puede estar debilitándose con rapidez. Inevitablemente, pues, comprender cabalmente las perturbaciones y las interacciones complejas que afectan a la economía ha de ser una tarea constante y exigente de análisis en tiempo real.      Retos para la política monetaria    Esta consideración plantea la difícil cuestión de cómo deberían reaccionar los responsables de la política monetaria, esto es, los bancos centrales, ante este entorno cambiante. Evidentemente, necesitamos tener la seguridad de que el análisis en que se basan las decisiones de política monetaria incorpore una comprensión adecuada de las complejidades de nuestro sistema global. El éxito de la política monetaria del Banco Central Europeo ha dependido en el pasado y, hoy más que nunca, depende de nuestra capacidad de tener en cuenta —en nuestros análisis económico y monetario— los rápidos cambios de nuestro entorno.  No obstante, aunque nuestros procesos de análisis y valoración tengan nuevos retos que afrontar, nuestras responsabilidades siguen siendo las mismas. Por complicadas que resulten las actuales condiciones de la economía mundial, las reglas de la política monetaria no han cambiado. También en nuestro mundo globalizado la inflación es un fenómeno monetario a largo plazo y la estabilidad de precios constituye la responsabilidad primordial de las autoridades monetarias.  Resulta obvio reconocer que la tarea se complica por la interacción con los factores restantes, como, por ejemplo, la repercusión de la escasez mundial de recursos o la creciente preocupación por el cambio climático. Sin embargo, la política monetaria debe continuar claramente centrada en su objetivo de garantizar la estabilidad de precios, que es prerrequisito fundamental para el funcionamiento eficiente de los mercados y la óptima asignación de recursos. Asegurando la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo, lo que requiere anticipar con precisión la inflación tendencial e identificar los riesgos al alza y a la baja alrededor de la tendencia, así como garantizar el firme anclaje de las expectativas de inflación, los bancos centrales contribuyen al correcto funcionamiento de la economía, al crecimiento sostenible y a la creación de empleo. El Banco Central Europeo, con su mandato primordial de garantizar la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo, mantiene su atención plenamente centrada en este objetivo de política monetaria.  En consonancia con dicha meta, en su reunión celebrada el 3 de julio de 2008, el Consejo de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo decidió, sobre la base de su análisis económico y monetario regulares, aumentar en 25 puntos básicos los tipos de interés, hasta el 4.25 por 100. El Consejo de Gobierno ha tomado esta decisión con el objetivo de actuar preventivamente para evitar la aparición de efectos generalizados de “segunda ronda” y de contrarrestar los crecientes riesgos alcistas para la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo. Esta decisión se ha adoptado en un contexto en el que las tasas de inflación medidas por el Indice Armonizado de Precios al Consumo (IAPC) han continuado elevándose de forma significativa desde el otoño del año pasado, y en el que se espera que dichas tasas se mantengan muy por encima del nivel compatible con la estabilidad de precios —definida como “un nivel inferior, aunque próximo, al 2% a medio plazo” — durante un período más prolongado de lo que se pensaba.  Al mismo tiempo, los fundamentos económicos de la zona euro siguen siendo sólidos y, pese a que, según lo esperado, el crecimiento se ha debilitado a mediados del 2008 tras un excepcional incremento intertrimestral del 0,8 por 100 en el primer trimestre, los datos más recientes siguen apuntando a la continuación del crecimiento moderado del PIB real. Asimismo, el dinamismo de la liquidez agregada y del crédito se mantiene vigoroso, sin restricciones significativas a la oferta de préstamos en el conjunto de la zona del euro, lo que confirma los riesgos al alza para la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo, dada la amplia liquidez acumulada en la economía.  A partir de estos datos e indicadores, ¿cuáles son las perspectivas de la economía de la zona euro de cara a 2008 y 2009? Por lo que se refiere al crecimiento económico, pese a la ausencia de desequilibrios y al mantenimiento de unos fundamentos sólidos, los riesgos apuntan predominantemente a la baja. Estos riesgos están relacionados, en particular, con la posibilidad de nuevas subidas no anticipadas de los precios de la energía y de otras materias primas, lo cual tendría un efecto moderador sobre el consumo de los hogares y la inversión de las empresas. Asimismo, los riesgos a la baja tienen origen en la posibilidad de que las tensiones en los mercados financieros afecten a la economía real de forma más adversa de lo anticipado, así como en la preocupación por la aparición de presiones proteccionistas y en un posible reajuste desordenado de los desequilibrios macroeconómicos globales.  Por lo que se refiere a la evolución de los precios, los riesgos se inclinan claramente al alza y se han intensificado en los últimos meses. Estos riesgos están relacionados con un escenario en el que puedan producirse nuevas subidas inesperadas de los precios de la energía y de los alimentos. Más fundamentalmente, la posibilidad de que un dinamismo de los salarios mayor de lo esperado y un aumento de la capacidad de fijación de los precios y márgenes en mercados con un reducido nivel de competencia puedan dar lugar a presiones inflacionistas a través de efectos generalizados de segunda ronda, constituye un importante motivo de preocupación. Asimismo, existen potenciales riesgos al alza relacionados con aumentos no previstos de los precios administrados y de los impuestos indirectos por parte de los gobiernos.  En este contexto de riesgos al alza para la estabilidad de precios, todos los agentes económicos –públicos y privados– deben estar a la altura de sus responsabilidades para ajustar sus comportamientos y sus decisiones a los cambios en los precios relativos y evitar la generalización de los efectos de segunda ronda derivados de la incorporación de la subida de los precios de la energía y de los alimentos al proceso de fijación de precios y salarios. A este respecto, es particularmente importante evitar las cláusulas de indiciación de los salarios nominales, pues tales mecanismos llevan asociado el riesgo de desatar y acelerar espirales de salarios y precios en respuesta a rebrotes inflacionistas. No es ocioso recordar en este punto que dichas espirales estuvieron en la raíz de los prolongados episodios de desempleo masivo que siguieron a los choques del petróleo y las materias primas de los 70 y los 80. Por su parte, el Consejo de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo tiene la clara y firme determinación de hacer en cada momento lo que sea necesario para cumplir con su mandato primordial –asegurar la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo–, y para mantener las expectativas de inflación a medio y a largo plazo firmemente ancladas en niveles compatibles con la estabilidad de precios.  Permítanme subrayar que este mandato, cuya definición clara y cuyo cumplimiento perseverante explican en gran medida nuestra credibilidad, es el desiderátum de décadas de experiencia de política monetaria en todo el mundo. En efecto, el mantenimiento de la estabilidad de precios es condición imprescindible para proteger y preservar el poder adquisitivo a medio plazo de los ciudadanos, sobre todo el de los ciudadanos pertenecientes a los segmentos más débiles de la sociedad, y también para continuar apoyando el crecimiento sostenible y el empleo.  Por lo que se refiere a la orientación de la política monetaria, sobre la base de nuestro análisis de la situación económica actual, creemos que la decisión del 3 de julio de incrementar los tipos de interés en 25 puntos básicos contribuirá a la consecución del objetivo de estabilidad de precios a medio plazo. Al mismo tiempo, el Consejo de Gobierno del Banco Central Europeo continuará desarrollando un seguimiento muy estrecho de todos los datos, cifras e indicadores relevantes en el futuro inmediato.       Retos para la gestión de liquidez    Dado que, actualmente, una de las dimensiones de la complejidad de la economía mundial son las turbulencias de los mercados financieros, permítanme referirme brevemente a las medidas adoptadas por el Banco Central Europeo al respecto. El Eurosistema siempre ha enfatizado la clara distinción que para nosotros existe entre el establecimiento de la orientación de la política monetaria, guiada por el imperativo de mantener la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo, y las decisiones relativas a la liquidez que se adoptan al ejecutar dicha orientación. Esta distinción sirve, fundamentalmente, para impedir que el “ruido” causado por los movimientos de la liquidez y por la volatilidad de los tipos de interés a muy corto plazo interfiera con la señalización de la orientación de la política monetaria. Desde el inicio de las tensiones financieras en agosto del 2007, las acciones del Banco Central Europeo han continuado respetando escrupulosamente este principio. Tanto en épocas de normalidad como en períodos turbulentos, el objetivo primordial de las operaciones de mercado abierto del Eurosistema es mantener el tipo de interés de los depósitos interbancarios\\xa0a un día lo más próximo posible al tipo mínimo de subasta. No obstante, durante el reciente período de turbulencias, dichas operaciones también han debido prestar especial atención a la necesidad de garantizar que las entidades de crédito solventes pudieran disponer de liquidez en todo momento, a fin de contribuir a suavizar los impedimentos al normal funcionamiento del mercado monetario. Desde el primer día de las turbulencias de los mercados financieros, en un entorno de mayor riesgo de liquidez y como respuesta a la mayor inestabilidad del patrón de demanda de liquidez de las entidades de crédito, el Banco Central Europeo ha alcanzado estos objetivos introduciendo adaptaciones técnicas de poca importancia relativa en su forma habitual de suministrar liquidez en épocas de normalidad, y sirviéndose para ello del margen de flexibilidad que le proporciona su marco de ejecución de la política monetaria.  En primer lugar, el Eurosistema ha ajustado la distribución de la liquidez proporcionada dentro del período de mantenimiento de reservas mediante la adjudicación anticipada de liquidez al principio del período ( front-loading) y su posterior reducción, de modo que el volumen total de la oferta de liquidez en el período de mantenimiento en su conjunto ha permanecido sin variación.  En segundo lugar, durante las turbulencias, el Eurosistema ha aplicado diferentes procedimientos de mercado abierto para suministrar liquidez al sistema bancario, más concretamente:     Ha aumentado la frecuencia de uso de las operaciones de ajuste con respecto a los períodos de normalidad, debido al carácter menos predecible de la demanda de liquidez.   Ha incrementado de forma significativa el volumen de financiación proporcionado a través de las operaciones de financiación a plazo más largo (OFPML), con el propósito de suavizar las condiciones del mercado monetario a plazo. El volumen suministrado mediante las operaciones principales de financiación (OPF) con vencimiento a una semana se ha reducido proporcionalmente, de modo que el volumen total de operaciones vivas ha permanecido sin variación.     A consecuencia de ello, el nivel medio de los tipos a un día se ha mantenido próximo al tipo mínimo de subasta, aunque en ocasiones su variabilidad ha sido mayor de lo normal, y estimamos que nuestras operaciones han tenido una incidencia positiva sobre las condiciones del mercado monetario a plazo, en particular por lo que se refiere a la reducción de la volatilidad.  El Eurosistema no tuvo que modificar su sistema de activos de garantía durante las turbulencias financieras porque, desde sus inicios, viene aceptando una gama relativamente amplia de activos públicos y privados de calidad adecuada, y concediendo acceso a operaciones de financiación de volúmenes considerables a numerosas entidades de contrapartida. Consideramos que por sí solo, gracias a los rasgos descritos y a su flexibilidad, el marco operativo del Eurosistema ha proporcionado notable estabilidad al sistema financiero durante las turbulencias, además de asegurar su cometido fundamental de señalizar la orientación de la política monetaria.  Es importante recordar que, a medida que se desarrollaban las turbulencias, los principales bancos centrales del mundo reforzaron su colaboración, inicialmente mejorando el intercambio de información y realizando un seguimiento colectivo de la evolución de los mercados y, posteriormente, adoptando medidas coordinadas de inyección de liquidez. Desde diciembre del 2007, el Banco Central Europeo, en colaboración con la Reserva Federal estadounidense y junto con el Banco Nacional de Suiza, ha venido efectuando varias operaciones de financiación a plazo —las denominadas operaciones TAF, «Term Auction Facility»—, a través de las cuales proporciona, por cuenta de la Reserva Federal, liquidez en dólares a entidades de crédito de la zona del euro. Estas operaciones de inyección de liquidez no tienen efectos directos sobre las condiciones de liquidez del euro, sino que se ejecutan para facilitar disponibilidad de financiación en dólares para entidades de crédito de la zona del euro y con el propósito de mejorar las condiciones de financiación globales. Nuestra valoración de los resultados de estas operaciones coordinadas es muy positiva.      Comentarios finales    Para finalizar, permítanme insistir en los exigentes retos que el entorno global hoy nos plantea a todos: ciudadanos, agentes sociales, instituciones financieras, gobiernos y, por supuesto, bancos centrales. Nos enfrentamos a un conjunto de perturbaciones globales, interdependientes y complejas, de gran relevancia para las decisiones de política económica y, en particular, de política monetaria. Destacan entre todas ellas la tendencia alcista y la volatilidad de los precios de las materias primas –en especial, petróleo y alimentos- y, desde mediados de 2007, la elevada incertidumbre asociada a las turbulencias financieras y al paralelo proceso de reapreciación del riesgo financiero. Esta complejidad, sin embargo, no cambia la naturaleza de la inflación a medio y largo plazo ni el carácter esencial de la misión de un banco central. Antes al contrario, cuando la inflación se ha situado a la cabeza de las preocupaciones de nuestros 320 millones de ciudadanos, nuestra obligación es dirigirnos a ellos para reiterarles que pueden tener confianza en el Banco Central Europeo y en el Eurosistema; que pueden contar con nosotros, en la plena seguridad de que haremos en cada momento lo que sea necesario para anclar las expectativas de inflación y para asegurar la estabilidad de precios a medio plazo. Porque es nuestro mandato; el que ellos nos dieron al crear el Banco Central Europeo. Y porque estamos convencidos de que sólo actuando así podemos apoyar el crecimiento sostenible y el empleo en la Eurozona, así como proteger a medio plazo el poder de compra y el nivel de vida de los ciudadanos. Muchas gracias por su atención.   ']\n"

      "['2024-03-14', 'Isabel Schnabel', 'The Eurosystem’s operational framework', 'Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting', \"  SPEECH  The Eurosystem’s operational framework   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

Balance sheet size and interest rate control”, speech at an event organised by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisors, New York, 27 March.     ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.     See, for example, Ahnert, T., Anand, K., Gai, P. and Chapman, J. (2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.

       " \"  SPEECH  The Eurosystem’s operational framework   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

Balance sheet size and interest rate control”, speech at an event organised by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisors, New York, 27 March.     ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.     See, for example, Ahnert, T., Anand, K., Gai, P. and Chapman, J. (2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.

       "\"g Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

Balance sheet size and interest rate control”, speech at an event organised by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisors, New York, 27 March.     ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This includes Pillar 3 “market discipline” requirements under the Basel III rules.     Schnabel, I. (2023), “Quantitative tightening: rationale and market impact”, speech at the Money Market Contact Group meeting,Frankfurt am Main, 2 March.     This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.     See, for example, Ahnert, T., Anand, K., Gai, P. and Chapman, J. (2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.
