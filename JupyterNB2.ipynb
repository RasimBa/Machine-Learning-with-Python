Duisenberg an der Universität Hohenheim am 9. Februar 1999', '  Die einheitliche europäische Geldpolitik   Vortrag des Präsidenten der Europäischen Zentralbank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg an der Universität Hohenheim am 9. Februar 1999 Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren!  Seit etwas mehr als fünf Wochen ist die gemeinsame europäische Geldpolitik Realität. Nach Jahren intensiver Vorbereitung und erfolgreicher wirtschaftlicher Konvergenz wird nun die Geldpolitik in einem großen Teil Europas einheitlich festgelegt, und zwar vom Rat der Europäischen Zentralbank. Umgesetzt wird die Geldpolitik vom Eurosystem, so bezeichnen wir die EZB und die elf Notenbanken der an der Europäischen Währungsunion teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten.  Die gemeinsame Währung notiert an den internationalen Finanzmärkten und wird im unbaren Zahlungsverkehr eingesetzt. Der Euro wird jedoch in der nächsten Zukunft nicht in Form von neuen Banknoten und Münzen greifbar. Trotzdem besteht kein Zweifel, daß diese am 1. Januar 1999 aus der Taufe gehobene Währung - nicht nur innerhalb des Europäischen Währungsraumes, sondern auch darüber hinaus - eine wichtige Rolle spielen wird.  Diese Zuversicht ist durchaus angebracht, meine Damen und Herren. Die ersten Wochen sind für die gemeinsame Währung und die Geldpolitik des Eurosystems insgesamt gut gelaufen. Der Start verlief zwar nicht völlig reibungslos - das war angesichts der Bedeutung und Größe dieses Projekts nicht zu erwarten - aber ohne größere Komplikationen.  Die Europäische Währungsunion ist eine einzigartige und herausragende Errungenschaft. Sie eröffnet die große Chance, das Ziel der Preisstabilität in Europa umfassend und dauerhaft zu verwirklichen. Geldwertstabilität ist der beste Beitrag, den die Geldpolitik zu anhaltendem Wirtschafts- und Beschäftigungswachstum in Europa leisten kann. Die nationalen Regierungen und die Tarifpartner sind aufgerufen, die strukturellen Ursachen der viel zu hohen Arbeitslosigkeit zu beseitigen. Man kann nur hoffen, daß die Einführung des Euro die Umsetzung struktureller Reformen beschleunigt.   Die stabilitätsorientierte geldpolitische Strategie des Eurosystems  Der Vertrag zur Gründung der Europäischen Gemeinschaft weist dem Europäischen System der Zentralbanken (ESZB) - und damit implizit dem Eurosystem - die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität als vorrangiges Ziel zu. Der EZB-Rat wird alles daran setzen, diesen Auftrag zu erfüllen und seine Geldpolitik der Öffentlichkeit in verständlicher Weise zu erläutern. Aus diesem Grund haben wir eine stabilitätsorientierte geldpolitische Strategie entworfen, die im wesentlichen aus drei Hauptelementen besteht.  Der EZB-Rat hat eine quantitative Definition seines vorrangigen Ziels, der Preisstabilität, veröffentlicht. Dadurch wird eine klare Orientierungshilfe für die Erwartungen bezüglich der künftigen Preisentwicklung gegeben. Preisstabilität wird definiert als Anstieg des Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex für das Euro-Währungsgebiet von unter 2% gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Die Veröffentlichung dieser Definition gibt der öffentlichkeit und dem Europäischen Parlament einen klaren Maßstab für die Beurteilung des Erfolgs der einheitlichen Geldpolitik und macht damit das Eurosystem und seine Politik transparent und nachprüfbar.  Die Formulierung \"unter 2%\" gibt eindeutig die Obergrenze für die gemessene Inflationsrate an, die mit Preisstabilität vereinbar ist. Ich glaube nicht extra betonen zu müssen, daß Deflation - also ein anhaltender Rückgang des Preisniveaus - mit Preisstabilität nicht vereinbar wäre. Die neuesten Zahlen für die Jahresinflationsrate des Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex für das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet entsprechen der Definition von Preisstabilität. Dieses Ergebnis ist freilich vor allem der Verdienst der erfolgreichen Geldpolitik der nationalen Notenbanken in den letzten Jahren vor Beginn der Währungsunion.  Die EZB ist erst gut einen Monat verantwortlich für die Geldpolitik. Den Erfolg ihrer heutigen Politik wird man erst in etwa ein bis zwei Jahren angemessen beurteilen können. Hierin spiegelt sich die Tatsache wider, daß die Transmission geldpolitischer Impulse relativ lange und variable Wirkungsverzögerungen beinhaltet. Der EZB-Rat hat folgerichtig hervorgehoben, daß Preisstabilität mittelfristig beibehalten werden muß. Diese Aussage betont nicht nur die Notwendigkeit einer zukunftsgerichteten Orientierung der Geldpolitik. Sie berücksichtigt auch die kurzfristige Volatilität der Preise aufgrund nicht-monetärer Schocks, die nicht durch die Geldpolitik kontrolliert werden können.  Zur Erreichung des Ziels der Preisstabilität stützt sich unsere Strategie insbesondere auf zwei \"Säulen\". Bevor ich hierauf näher eingehe, möchte ich betonen, daß sich durch die Einführung des Euro gewohnte und bisher verläßliche makroökonomische Beziehungen verändern könnten. Nicht zuletzt aus diesem Grund waren sowohl die Strategie der Geldmengensteuerung als auch die direkte Inflationssteuerung nicht anwendbar. Unsere Strategie ist auch keine einfache Kombination dieser beiden Ansätze. Sie ist vielmehr genau auf die Bedürfnisse der EZB zugeschnitten.  Die erste Säule der geldpolitischen Strategie beruht auf einer herausragenden Rolle für die Geldmenge. Da Inflation auf mittlere Frist letztendlich ein monetäres Phänomen ist, stellt die Geldmenge einen natürlichen \"nominalen Anker\" für eine auf die Sicherung der Preisstabilität ausgerichtete Geldpolitik dar. Um diese herausragende Rolle zu unterstreichen, hat der EZB-Rat einen quantitativen Referenzwert für das Geldmengenwachstum bekanntgegeben. Der erste vom EZB-Rat beschlossene Referenzwert für das M3-Wachstum beträgt 4½% per annum und wurde am 1. Dezember 1998 veröffentlicht. Dieser Wert basiert auf der eben genannten Definition von Preisstabilität und unterstellt ein Trend-Wachstum des realen Bruttoinlandsproduktes von 2 bis 2½% pro Jahr sowie eine mittelfristige Verringerung der Umlaufgeschwindigkeit von M3 von circa ½ bis 1% jährlich.  Wir werden auf Abweichungen des Geldmengenwachstums vom Referenzwert jedoch nicht mechanistisch reagieren, sondern dies zunächst sorgfältig im Hinblick auf Signale für zukünftige Preisentwicklungen analysieren. Größere oder langanhaltende Abweichungen sollten normalerweise Risiken für die Preisstabilität signalisieren.  Die zweite Säule der geldpolitischen Strategie fußt auf einer breit fundierten Beurteilung der Aussichten für die Preisentwicklung im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet. Diese Einschätzung wird sich auf eine breite Palette von geldpolitischen Indikatoren stützen. Dabei werden insbesondere solche Variablen eingehend analysiert, die Informationen über zukünftige Preisentwicklungen enthalten können. Diese Analysen sollen nicht nur Aufschluß über die Risiken für die Preisentwicklung geben, sondern auch die Ursache von unerwarteten änderungen wichtiger ökonomischer Größen identifizieren helfen.  Einige Kommentatoren haben diese umfassende Analyse auf eine Inflationsprognose verkürzt. Gleichzeitig wurde gefordert, die EZB müsse diese Prognose veröffentlichen, um den Ansprüchen der Transparenz und der Rechenschaftspflicht zu genügen. Lassen Sie mich deshalb klarstellen: unsere Strategie beinhaltet eine umfassende Analyse zahlreicher Indikatoren sowie mehrerer Prognosen. Die Fokussierung auf eine einzige offizielle Inflationsprognose des Eurosystems für einen bestimmten Zeitpunkt würde unseren internen Analyse- und Entscheidungsprozeß keinesfalls adäquat widerspiegeln. Sie würde damit die Transparenz und Klarheit der Erklärung unserer Politik beeinträchtigen. Die Veröffentlichung einer offiziellen Inflationsprognose ist auch ungeeignet, der Rechenschaftspflicht der EZB zu dienen. Dies gilt verstärkt dann, wenn diese Prognose auf der Annahme einer unveränderten Geldpolitik beruht. Der Erfolg der Geldpolitik der EZB sollte primär an der Einhaltung der Preisstabilität gemessen werden, nicht daran wie exakt ihre konditionalen Prognosen sind.  Die stabilitätsorientierte geldpolitische Strategie des Eurosystems, die ich eben kurz beschrieben habe, stellt eine neue und klare Strategie dar, die die Vorrangigkeit des Preisstabilitätsziels betont. Sie berücksichtigt die zwangsläufigen Unsicherheiten über wirtschaftliche Beziehungen, die mit dem übergang zur Währungsunion und dem damit verbundenen Regimewechsel zusammenhängen, und sie garantiert ein großes Maß an Transparenz.  Meine Damen und Herren, erlauben Sie mir einige Anmerkungen zu Vorschlägen bezüglich der Ausrichtung der Geldpolitik, die jüngst in der Presse zu lesen waren. Einige dieser Ideen erwecken den Eindruck, als solle sich die Geldpolitik auf andere Ziele als die Preisstabilität konzentrieren, da stabile Preise bereits erreicht seien. So wurde unter anderem vorgeschlagen, daß die EZB mehr oder weniger mechanistisch auf Wechselkursentwicklungen oder andere Variablen, wie zum Beispiel die Lohnstückkosten, reagieren sollte. Zudem wurde gefordert, die Geldpolitik solle sich mit Zinssenkungen in den Dienst der Bekämpfung der Arbeitslosigkeit stellen. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es notwendig, klar die Möglichkeiten und die Grenzen der Geldpolitik aufzuzeigen.  Sowohl die Logik des Vertrages von Maastricht als auch zahlreiche ökonomische Analysen zeigen, daß der beste Beitrag, den die einheitliche Geldpolitik für die Beschäftigungsentwicklung leisten kann, darin besteht, sich auf die Preisstabilität zu konzentrieren. Ohne eine solche klare Ausrichtung bestünde die Gefahr, daß die öffentlichkeit die Verpflichtung des Eurosystems auf das Ziel der Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität in Zweifel zöge. Inflationserwartungen, Risikoprämien und damit die langfristigen Zinsen würden steigen. Dies würde die Kosten für Investitionen, die für eine nachhaltige und dauerhafte Verbesserung des Lebensstandards notwendig sind, verteuern.  Aber auch im günstigsten Fall - das heißt wenn es gelingt Preisstabilität dauerhaft zu sichern - kann die Geldpolitik die großen wirtschaftlichen Probleme der Arbeitslosigkeit und die Zukunftsprobleme der Sozialversicherungen keinesfalls alleine lösen.  Der EZB-Rat sieht die hohe Arbeitslosigkeit im Euro-Währungsgebiet mit sehr großer Besorgnis. Dieses Problem ist jedoch ganz überwiegend strukturell bedingt. Seine Ursache liegt vor allem in den zum Teil durch übermäßige und unangemessene Regelungsdichte entstandenen Rigiditäten auf den Arbeits- und Gütermärkten des Euro-Währungsgebiets. Wirtschaftliche Strukturreformen, die auf den Abbau von Inflexibilitäten zielen, sind die angemessene Antwort darauf. In den Ländern des Euro-Währungsgebiets, in denen solche Reformen umgesetzt worden sind, ist die Arbeitslosenquote beträchtlich zurückgegangen. Zudem möchte ich betonen, daß eine moderate Entwicklung der Lohnkosten und eine Reduzierung der Steuer- und Abgabenlast den Abbau der Arbeitslosigkeit generell unterstützen würden. Dies wäre auch dann der Fall, wenn das betreffende Land keinen intensiven Handel mit den Nachbarländern betreiben würde. Der positive Einfluß von niedrigen Steuern und Lohnkosten auf die Beschäftigung ist international gesehen deutlich mehr als ein Nullsummenspiel. Eine so ausgerichtete Politik sollte nicht als \"Lohndumping\" gebrandmarkt werden.  Was nun die Rolle der Wechselkurse zwischen dem Euro und anderen wichtigen Währungen außerhalb der EU, insbesondere dem US Dollar, betrifft, hat das Eurosystem mit der Ausgestaltung seiner geldpolitischen Strategie eine unzweideutige Wahl getroffen. Diese Strategie schließt explizite oder implizite Ziele oder Zielzonen für den Euro-Wechselkurs eindeutig aus. Die Verfolgung eines Wechselkursziels könnte leicht die Einhaltung des Preisstabilitätsziels gefährden und damit auch die reale Wirtschaftsentwicklung beeinträchtigen. Zielzonen für Wechselkurse könnten zum Beispiel dazu führen, daß die EZB in einer Rezession trotz zunehmendem Druck in Richtung sinkender Preise die Zinsen anheben müßte. Sie stimmen sicher mit mir überein, daß eine solche mechanistische Reaktion auf eine Wechselkursänderung des Euro nicht optimal wäre. Auch sollten wir nicht vergessen, daß wir in einer Welt mit hoher Kapitalmobilität leben. Wechselkursvereinbarungen, die vielleicht noch vor einiger Zeit umgesetzt werden konnten, sind wohl nicht länger realisierbar.  Aufgrund des Fehlens eines Wechselkursziels sollte man nicht darauf schließen, daß die EZB den Außenwert des Euro mit völligem Gleichmut betrachtet oder ignoriert. Im Gegenteil, der Wechselkurs wird als ein potentiell wichtiger geldpolitischer Indikator im Rahmen der breit fundierten Beurteilung der Aussichten für die Preisentwicklung beobachtet und analysiert. Eine stabilitätsorientierte Geld- und Fiskalpolitik, wie sie der Vertrag von Maastricht und der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt vorgeben, stellt eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für einen stabilen Euro-Wechselkurs dar. Eine Garantie für dauerhafte Wechselkursstabilität gibt es natürlich nicht, übrigens auch nicht im Falle von fixierten Wechselkursen. Wechselkursausschläge sind häufig von der Struktur- oder Fiskalpolitik, von asymmetrischen realen Schocks oder konjunkturellen Unterschieden verursacht. Die Geldpolitik wäre eindeutig überfordert, wenn sie solche Wechselkursänderungen verhindern sollte.  Wir können und werden unsere Geldpolitik nicht an einer einzigen Variablen ausrichten, sei es ein Geldmengenaggregat, ein Index, der Wechselkurs oder eine Inflationsprognose für einen bestimmten Zeitpunkt. Wir können uns auch nicht auf eine ex ante Koordinierung einlassen, bei der wir uns verpflichten, auf gewisse Zusagen oder Pläne zu reagieren. Die EZB wird immer alle relevanten Indikatoren sorgfältig analysieren. Dabei ist es besonders wichtig, daß die wirtschaftlichen Ursachen für mögliche Risiken der Preisstabilität im Euro-Gebiet bestmöglich verstanden werden. Die geeigneten geldpolitischen Entscheidungen hängen auch von den Ursachen der unerwarteten änderungen wichtiger ökonomischer Größen ab. Der EZB-Rat muß sich zum Beispiel ein Urteil darüber bilden, ob Veränderungen wichtiger Indikatoren vorübergehender oder permanenter Natur sind, und ob es sich um einen Nachfrage- oder Angebotsschock handelt. Auch die erwarteten Reaktionen der Finanzmärkte, der Verbraucher und der Unternehmen auf geldpolitische Entscheidungen versuchen wir in unsere Überlegungen einzubeziehen. Ich glaube es ist unstrittig, daß eine derart komplexe Analyse nicht einfach auf eine mehr oder weniger mechanistische Reaktion auf einige wenige Variablen oder eine einzige offizielle Prognose reduziert werden kann.  Vielfach wurde auch die Befürchtung geäußert, daß das Eurosystem nicht transparent genug agiere. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde angemerkt, daß eine transparente Geldpolitik auch die Veröffentlichung der Protokolle der EZB-Ratssitzungen und die Offenlegung des Abstimmungsverhaltens der einzelnen Ratsmitglieder bedinge.  Aus guten Gründen hat der EZB-Rat entschieden, diesen Weg nicht zu beschreiten. Eine Veröffentlichung individueller Stellungnahmen könnte leicht zu einer nationalen Vereinnahmung der einzelnen Ratsmitglieder führen. Die Mitglieder des EZB-Rates dürfen jedoch nicht als nationale Vertreter verstanden werden. Sie entscheiden gemeinsam die Geldpolitik für das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet. Der EZB-Rat hat sich verpflichtet, noch über die im Vertrag festgelegten Berichts- und Erläuterungspflichten hinauszugehen, die gemessen an internationalen Standards zu den umfassendsten gehören.  Auf Grundlage unserer Strategie gebe ich nach jeder ersten Sitzung im Monat eine ausführliche Erläuterung unserer Einschätzung der gesamten wirtschaftlichen Lage und insbesondere der Aussichten für die Preisstabilität vor der Presse ab. Der Inhalt dieser sogenannten \"Einleitenden Bemerkungen\" kommt sehr nahe an das heran, was andere Notenbanken Protokolle nennen. Auf diese Art und Weise wird die öffentlichkeit unmittelbar nach den Sitzungen des EZB-Rates umfassend informiert. Zudem werden wir jeden Monat in unserem Bulletin einen ausführlichen Bericht über die wirtschaftliche Lage und die Geldpolitik im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet veröffentlichen. Eine solch schnelle Information über die Ergebnisse der Sitzungen des EZB-Rates und die aktuelle wirtschaftliche Analyse der EZB ist zweifellos Ausdruck einer sehr weitgehenden Offenheit und Transparenz.   Jüngste geldpolitische Entscheidungen und Operationen  Die Zusammenarbeit der Europäischen Zentralbanken war immer sehr eng. In den letzten Monaten des Jahres 1998 ist diese Kooperation zwischen den Teilnehmern an der dritten Stufe der Währungsunion zunehmend vertieft worden. Die koordinierte Senkung der Leitzinsen Anfang Dezember 1998 hat klar gezeigt, daß die Währungsunion de facto schon vor dem Beginn der Stufe 3 begonnen hatte. Diese koordinierte Maßnahme hat - wie wir jetzt wissen - wesentlich zur Stabilisierung der Markterwartungen beigetragen.  Seit etwas mehr als fünf Wochen werden von der EZB geldpolitische Operationen durchgeführt und zwar hauptsächlich in Form von befristeten Offenmarkttransaktionen. Das Hauptgeschäft wird in wöchentlichem Abstand mit einer Laufzeit von jeweils zwei Wochen abgeschlossen. Bisher wurden diese Operationen fünfmal zum festen Zinssatz von 3% erfolgreich abgewickelt.  Neben den befristeten Transaktionen, die das Hauptinstrument zur Liquiditätskontrolle und Zinssteuerung darstellen, bietet das Eurosystem zwei \"ständige\" Fazilitäten an: die Spitzenrefinanzierungsfazilität und die Einlagenfazilität. Diese können von den Kreditinstituten über die nationalen Zentralbanken in Anspruch genommen werden. Die Spitzenrefinzierungsfazilität ist in erster Linie ein Sicherheitsventil bei kurzfristigen Liquiditätsengpässen im Bankensystem und begrenzt damit die Ausschläge der Geldmarktsätze nach oben. Gewissermaßen das Gegenstück ist die kurzfristige Einlagenfazilität, die kurzfristige Liquiditätsüberschüsse abfangen soll. Sie bildet die Untergrenze für die Geldmarktsätze. Für den Beginn der Währungsunion wurde der Einlagenzinssatz auf 2% und der Spitzenrefinanzierungssatz auf 4,5% festgelegt.  Als eine vorübergehende Maßnahme hatte der EZB-Rat beschlossen, den Korridor zwischen dem Spitzenrefinanzierungs- und dem Einlagensatz vom 4. Januar bis zum 21. Januar 1999 auf 2,75% bis 3,25% einzuengen. Dies diente dem Zweck, die notwendigen Anpassungen an das neue institutionelle Umfeld, verbunden mit dem übergang zur Stufe 3, zu erleichtern. Wie zuvor angekündigt, wurde am 21. Januar 1999 beschlossen, wieder zu jenen Zinssätzen für die beiden \"ständigen\" Fazilitäten zurückzukehren, die für den Start der einheitlichen Geldpolitik festgelegt worden waren. Seit dem 22. Januar 1999 beträgt daher der Einlagenzinssatz 2% und der Spitzenrefinanzierungssatz 4,5%.  Ausschlaggebend für diese Entscheidung waren die Erfahrungen mit dem das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet umfassenden Geldmarkt seit Jahresbeginn. Der EZB-Rat stellte fest, daß sich die Schwierigkeiten einiger Marktteilnehmer mit der Einführung des integrierten Geldmarktes, und insbesondere mit den grenzüberschreitenden Liquiditätsströmen, in der Zwischenzeit merklich verringert hatten. Insgesamt gesehen hat die Integration des Geldmarktes im Euro-Währungsgebiet bereits drei Wochen nach ihrer Umsetzung ein zufriedenstellendes Stadium erreicht. Bei der Analyse des Geldmarktes ist unter anderem zu beachten, daß sich EZB-Zinssätze und kurzfristigen Marktzinssätze durchaus unterscheiden können. Zum einen können in den Marktsätzen Kreditrisikoprämien enthalten sein, zum anderen können Erwartungen zu Unterschieden zwischen beiden Sätzen führen.  In seiner Sitzung am letzten Donnerstag hat der EZB-Rat seine frühere Beurteilung der Aussichten für die Preisentwicklung bestätigt. Daher wurde beschlossen, die Bedingungen für die nächsten Hauptrefinanzierungsoperationen am 10. und am 17. Februar 1999 unverändert zu belassen. Sie werden als Mengentender zu einem festen Zinssatz von 3% durchgeführt, wie schon die entsprechenden geldpolitischen Operationen davor.  Daneben wurden in den letzten Wochen auch die ersten längerfristigen Offenmarktoperationen in Form von befristeten Transaktionen abgewickelt. Diese wurden am 14. Januar 1999 in drei parallel laufenden Tenderverfahren mit ein-, zwei- und dreimonatiger Laufzeit durchgeführt. Dabei wurde das Zinstenderverfahren angewandt. Im Gegensatz zu den regulären Hauptrefinanzierungsoperationen verfolgt das Eurosystem mit diesen längerfristigen Geschäften nicht die Absicht, dem Markt Signale zu geben, und tritt deshalb im Regelfall als Preisnehmer auf. Die EZB gibt daher schon im voraus Hinweise auf die geplanten Zuteilungsvolumina. Zinssätze, die bei diesen geldpolitischen Geschäften zustande kommen, sind deshalb als Indikatoren der vorherrschenden Marktsituation zu sehen.   Regelmäßige Beurteilung der monetären, finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen Situation  Zum Abschluß meiner Ausführungen möchte ich noch kurz über die aktuelle Beurteilung des EZB-Rates bezüglich der monetären, finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen Situation berichten. Auf Basis dieser Einschätzungen hat der EZB-Rat am letzten Donnerstag entschieden, die Zinssätze unverändert zu lassen.  Unter Berücksichtigung der jüngsten monetären Daten für Dezember 1998 blieb der gleitende Dreimonatsdurchschnitt der 12-Monatsraten der Geldmenge M3 (für Oktober bis Dezember 1998) mit 4,7% weitgehend stabil. Dies ist ein Wert, der sehr nahe bei dem vom EZB-Rat festgesetzten Referenzwert liegt. Nach unserer Analyse zeigt die Geldmengenentwicklung keine Risiken für die Preisstabilität. Die Kredite an den privaten Sektor sind auch im Dezember des vergangenen Jahres sehr stark gewachsen. Wir sehen darin im Moment zwar keine inflationären Signale, werden die weiteren Entwicklungen jedoch sorgfältig beobachten.  Im Hinblick auf die breit fundierte Beurteilung der Aussichten für die Preisentwicklung und der Risiken für die Preisstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet, können die finanziellen Entwicklungen als Indikator einer günstigen Beurteilung der jüngsten geldpolitischen Entscheidungen des Eurosystems gesehen werden. Sie signalisieren, daß die Finanzmarktteilnehmer eine Fortsetzung des preisstabilen Umfeldes erwarten. Die langfristigen Zinsen sind am Jahresbeginn 1999 auf neue historische Tiefs gesunken, und die Zinsstrukturkurve hat sich insgesamt nach unten verschoben. Die Finanzierungsbedingungen für Investitionen sind dadurch derzeit ausgesprochen günstig.  Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sind die Wachstumsaussichten für das Euro-Währungsgebiet allerdings nach wie vor auch von den Unsicherheiten bezüglich der weltwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung im Jahre 1999 geprägt. Diese Unsicherheiten haben sich auf die Indikatoren des Geschäftsklimas im Euro-Währungsgebiet negativ ausgewirkt. Vielfach wird nun eine Konjunkturverlangsamung in der näheren Zukunft erwartet. Diese Eintrübung des außenwirtschaftlichen Umfeldes ist vor allem auf die Finanzmarktkrisen in Asien, Rußland und Lateinamerika zurückzuführen. Allerdings ist das Bild nicht eindeutig. Während die Wachstumsrate der Industrieproduktion bis November 1998 zurückging, zeigten Einzelhandelsumsätze und Konsumentenvertrauen bis zuletzt freundlichere Tendenzen. Zudem blieb das Wachstum des realen Bruttoinlandsproduktes im Euro-Gebiet im dritten Quartal 1998 relativ robust. In den USA ist das reale Wachstum im vierten Quartal sogar höher als erwartet ausgefallen. Gemessen am Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex sind die Verbraucherpreise im Dezember 1998 im Euro-Währungsgebiet um 0,8% gestiegen. Das ist ein zehntel Prozentpunkt weniger als im November. Diese Entwicklung steht im Einklang mit früheren Tendenzen. Sie läßt sich insbesondere auf einen weiteren Rückgang der Energiepreise und eine Abschwächung des Preisanstiegs bei Industrieerzeugnissen zurückführen.  Alles in allem deuten die eben beschriebene wirtschaftliche Entwicklung und die verfügbaren Prognosen für 1999 nicht auf einen merklichen Abwärts- oder Aufwärtsdruck auf die weitere Preisentwicklung hin. Potentielle Abwärtsrisiken könnten sich durch eine Veränderung der weltwirtschaftlichen Situation und den damit verbundenen Auswirkungen auf das Euro-Währungsgebiet ergeben. Diese Entwicklungen müssen sorgfältig beobachtet werden. Ein gewisser inflationärer Druck ist bei einem starken Anstieg der Lohnkosten und einer Lockerung der Fiskalpolitik zu befürchten. Auch die Wechselkursentwicklung werden wir wegen ihrer Bedeutung für die Preisentwicklung genau beobachten.  Lassen Sie mich abschließend betonen, daß das derzeitige Niveau der Realzinsen ausgesprochen niedrig ist. Wenn man die Realzinsen vereinfacht als Differenz der nominalen Zinsen und des laufenden Anstiegs der Verbraucherpreise (HVPI) mißt, dann lagen die kurzfristigen Realzinsen im Januar 1999 bei 2,3%, also etwa 80 Basispunkte niedriger als vor einen Jahr. Die langfristigen Realzinsen sind mit 110 Basispunkten noch stärker gefallen und lagen im Januar bei 3%. Diese Niveaus sind sehr niedrig, sowohl im aktuellen internationalen als auch im historischen Vergleich. Im Einklang mit der Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität unterstützen die gegenwärtigen monetären und finanziellen Bedingungen damit eindeutig das künftige Wirtschaftswachstum. Mehr kann die Geldpolitik nicht tun, will sie nicht die großen gesamtwirtschaftlichen Vorteile der Preisstabilität und ihrer Glaubwürdigkeit gefährden.  Echte strukturelle Reformen, die die Flexibilität der Arbeitsmärkte erhöhen, sowie ein weiterhin moderater Anstieg der Lohnkosten würden nicht nur die Geldpolitik erleichtern, sondern auch die Beschäftigungsentwicklung unterstützen. Dies gilt verstärkt dann, wenn sich die Konjunktur in diesem Jahr aufgrund der außenwirtschaftlichen Eintrübungen stärker als erwartet abschwächen sollte.   ']\n",

A few weeks ago, Frankfurt, as the location of the European Central Bank (ECB), was very much a focus of international media attention. The introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was a historic step towards European integration, which was followed with excitement - and perhaps also some anxiety - by the media and the public at large. On that date, the national currencies of 11 European countries became denominations of a single currency; the euro. At the same time, the \"Eurosystem\" (which is composed of the ECB and the 11 national central banks of the participating EU Member States) assumed responsibility for the monetary policy of the euro area.  I must admit that I personally was quite nervous about the changeover to the euro. Although I knew that the ECB was technically well prepared for the changeover, one can never entirely rule out unexpected problems in such a gigantic project. With hindsight, I am very relieved that the technical changeover to the euro went so smoothly.  However, the technical changeover was only the first hurdle for the successful establishment of the euro. We now have to focus on ensuring its long-term success. In today\\'s presentation, I shall discuss some of the factors affecting the role of the euro in the international monetary system in the longer term. In this regard, I shall also give an overview of the possible development of the euro as an investment currency, a reserve currency and a trade currency.   1. Factors determining the international role of the euro   Clearly, it is still too early to be able to assess accurately how important the euro will become in the international monetary system. It is only natural that it should take some time for traders, investors, analysts and other financial market agents to become accustomed to a new currency and decide on the weight which they will assign to it for various purposes.  In practice, the international importance of a currency is mainly determined by three distinct factors:      the size of the economy backing the currency;    the economic policies of the country (or countries) where the currency is issued; and    the efficiency and competitiveness of the financial markets in which instruments denominated in the currency are traded.      Turning first to the size of the euro area economy, it may be of interest to make a brief comparison between the size of the euro area and that of the United States: the population of the euro area (292 million) is slightly larger than that of the United States (270 million), while the GDP of the euro area (EUR 5,800 billion) is somewhat smaller than the GDP of the United States (EUR 7,600 billion). The euro area is, however, a more open economy than the United States in the sense that foreign trade (exports and imports) amounts to 25% of GDP, while in the United States the corresponding figure is just below 20%. Altogether, the size of the euro area, regardless of which measure is applied, is comparable with that of the US economy. The large size of the euro area would suggest that the euro should, from the outset, assume the role of one of the world\\'s leading currencies.  However, the sheer size of the euro area is not sufficient to ensure the importance of the euro in the international financial scene. It is also necessary for euro area economic policies to be perceived as ensuring stability and credibility. On this point, I think that the institutional set-up of the Eurosystem ensures that the euro will be a stable and credible currency. In practice, the credibility of a currency is built on many elements, some of which are beyond the control of the central bank.  A first fundamental building block is to ensure that the central bank\\'s monetary policy decisions are independent of political pressures. This building block was enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty. The institutional set-up ensures that the ECB and the participating national central banks enjoy a very high degree of independence, possibly more than any other central bank in the world.  For the credibility of the monetary policy, it is also important that the overall objective is unambiguous, that the strategy for achieving this objective is transparent and that policy measures are clearly explained. By following a transparent approach, the central bank can directly improve the efficiency of monetary policy by promoting the right expectations among market participants concerning what the central bank hopes to achieve. Hence a predictable monetary policy may contribute to achieving stable prices with the lowest possible interest rates. For these reasons, the Eurosystem emphasises transparency in its monetary policy framework. In order to enhance transparency with regard to its policy measures, the Governing Council of the ECB intends to inform the public regularly and in detail about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area. Its policy measures will be explained in relation to the framework of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem.  A third important building block for a credible monetary policy is to ensure that the operational framework makes it possible for the monetary policy decisions to be implemented efficiently. The Eurosystem has placed considerable emphasis on the establishment of an operational framework which is consistent with market principles and which ensures equal treatment of counterparties and financial systems across the euro area.  Apart from these three building blocks, which are largely under the direct control of the Eurosystem, credibility also relies to a considerable extent on the preparedness of governments to pursue stability-oriented policies of fiscal discipline and to undertake necessary structural reforms. On this point, the Stability and Growth Pact provides a basic framework for fiscal discipline and should enhance the governments\\' incentive to proceed with structural reforms.  I am also optimistic with regard to the development of efficient and internationally competitive financial markets in the euro area. Traditionally, financial market developments in continental Europe have lagged behind developments in the United States and the United Kingdom. A main factor behind the slower development of the financial markets in continental Europe is their strict national segmentation. This segmentation and a lack of cross-border competition have implied relatively low trading volumes, high transaction costs and a reluctance to implement innovative financial instruments. The segmentation is a function of tradition, differing practices and, of course, national regulations and tax regimes.  However, the European financial markets are currently undergoing rapid development characterised by cross-border integration and the provision of new financial services. These developments are partly due to the continuous technological development in the financial sector. They have also received new impetus from the establishment of the Single Market in the European Union and were further underpinned by the introduction of the euro, which removed the foreign exchange risk of cross-border operations in the euro area.   2. The role of the euro in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets  Turning to the role of the euro in different segments of the international financial markets, I should first like to say a few words about the spot and forward foreign exchange markets. In these markets, the US dollar has been the most important currency since it overtook the pound sterling in the 1930s. It is estimated that in 1997 the dollar was involved in 84% of all foreign exchange transactions. This compares with 55% for the currencies which were replaced by the euro and 24% for the Japanese yen.  The introduction of the euro immediately produced major changes in the functioning of foreign exchange markets. The disappearance of 11 national currencies and the introduction of the euro as a major international currency had an impact, in itself, on the turnover and focus of attention in the global foreign exchange markets. Euro/dollar trading has, from the start, established itself as the most active and liquid segment of the foreign exchange market. By contrast, the development of euro/yen trading has so far been surprisingly slow.  The role of the euro in the foreign exchange markets must be seen against the background of the exchange rate policy of the Eurosystem. By contrast with most of the currencies which it replaced, the euro is a freely floating currency. In the absence of any policy co-ordination between the three main currency blocs, the euro exchange rate will reflect the outcome of all relevant economic policies rather than being an objective in itself. Of course, the ECB will monitor exchange rate developments as part of its overall assessment of a broad range of economic and financial indicators which are relevant for inflation developments.   3. The role of the euro as an investment currency  How important will the euro become, though, as an investment currency in the global money and capital markets? At present, the US dollar is the predominant international investment currency. In 1997 the share of dollar-denominated instruments of the bonds outstanding in the international bond markets amounted to 46%, followed by Japanese yen-denominated debt (11%) and debt denominated in Deutsche Mark (10%). All the euro area currencies together accounted for approximately 24% of the international bond market.  Several arguments seem to indicate that the euro may become a more attractive currency for bond issuers than all the currencies which it replaced taken together. In fact, the euro was the most popular currency for bonds issued in the international markets in the first month after its introduction, accounting for approximately 55% of the volume of new bond issues, compared with 40% for the US dollar. However, the high figures for euro-denominated bond issuance in January 1999 may, to a certain extent, reflect a particularly high level of initial interest in euro-denominated instruments during the new currency\\'s first month of existence. We may therefore experience a drop in the euro\\'s market share of new bond issues from the high level experienced last month.  As I mentioned in my introduction, a key element in determining the longer-term attractiveness of the euro as an investment currency will be the emergence of efficient, large and integrated financial markets in the euro area. The introduction of the euro will remove currency risk, increase cross-border competition and provide an incentive for the harmonisation of market practices, thereby generally reducing transaction costs.  The conditions for financial market integration in the euro area seem to be best at the short end of the yield curve. In fact, the conduct of a single monetary policy by the Eurosystem gave market agents an incentive to start large-scale cross-border trade right from the outset, thereby creating an almost fully integrated money market in the euro area. The integration of the previous national money markets was made possible thanks to the TARGET system, which connects the national real-time gross settlement systems in the euro area. It thereby facilitates banks\\' cross-border dealing and accessing of funds in euro. The existence of an integrated money market implies that arbitrage should eliminate any cross-border differences in interest rates.  At the longer end of the yield curve, cross-border integration is likely to take more time. Before the introduction of the euro, European bond markets were highly segmented. Traditionally, this segmentation was a result partly of different currency denominations and partly of other market-specific conditions, such as differences in national regulations, tax regimes, practices and market conventions. The introduction of the euro did remove the foreign currency risks and has been accompanied by an increased harmonisation of market conventions. As a consequence, the substitutability between bonds traded in different national markets improved. In fact, the trading of euro area government bonds can already be considered to be largely integrated.  However, the markets for private bonds, and in particular for mortgage bonds, are still highly segmented owing to the differing institutional and regulatory frameworks across Member States. Nevertheless, the tendency towards increased cross-border competition and lower transaction costs in the national markets may also provide an incentive for increased issuance volumes of private bonds. We may experience a virtuous circle in which the increased issuance of bonds denominated in euro will draw the attention of international investors to euro-denominated assets, thereby making the euro an increasingly attractive currency for private as well as public bond issuers.  In this context, it is interesting to compare the current sizes of the bond markets in the euro area and the United States. The market value of the bonds issued in the United States (USD 10,700 billion) is currently twice as large as in the euro area (USD 5,300 billion). While the market value of government bonds is of a comparable magnitude in the United States and the euro area, there are large differences in the markets for corporate bonds. The market value of corporate bonds outstanding in the United States is, at present, almost ten times larger than in the euro area.  These figures seem to indicate that there is plenty of scope for further securitisation in the euro area. The introduction of the euro certainly underpins this development. The establishment of a benchmark for government bonds, increasing economies of scale, narrower bid-ask spreads, lower hedging costs for debt securities issued by private firms and more competitive underwriting are likely to provide incentives for European corporations to issue their own securities instead of borrowing from banks.  Moreover, the euro area financial markets now offer a more diversified set of financial instruments than that which was previously available in any national market in the euro area. This will give international investors greater scope for portfolio diversification for investments in euro-denominated assets without their having to incur additional foreign exchange risk. To the extent that the euro area is a large and rather closed economy, yields on bonds denominated in euro are likely to become increasingly independent of changes in US yields compared with the present situation for bonds denominated in the national currencies. If this is the case, euro area bonds will provide an attractive opportunity for investors who would like to achieve increased risk diversification in relation to US financial instruments.   4. The role of the euro as an official reserve currency  The euro may also become an attractive currency for the investment of official reserves. Currently the US dollar is by far the most important official reserve currency world-wide; at the end of 1996 the share of dollar-denominated instruments in official reserves amounted to approximately 64%, while the euro area currencies accounted for 25% and the Japanese yen for 6%. The euro\\'s share of world-wide official reserves is likely to have fallen at the start of Stage Three since the Deutsche Mark reserves previously held by euro area national central banks have become domestic euro area assets.  However, the euro\\'s share of the global official reserves may soon increase again. The euro is likely to become an important anchor currency in other European countries which, formally or informally, might find it useful to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a basket of currencies in which the euro is a large component. This is the case at present for the \"pre-in countries\" participating in ERM II as well as for several countries in central and eastern Europe which link their currencies to the euro, whether by a currency board, a fixed or crawling peg or a managed float.  In addition, other countries will also have to reassess their reserve management strategies in the light of the improved diversification opportunities offered by the new currency. It is possible that countries in Asia and Latin America, which traditionally have predominantly held US dollar reserves, may find it useful to diversify their reserve holdings gradually by acquiring euro.   5. The role of the euro as a trade currency  A further aspect of the internationalisation of the euro is its developing role as an invoicing currency for foreign trade. Today, the US dollar is by far the most important international transaction currency. It is estimated that approximately 50% of world trade is currently priced in dollars, compared with less than one-third in the currencies which were replaced by the euro and 5% in Japanese yen. Initially, the \"market share\" of the euro will have fallen compared with the previous combined \"market shares\" of the currencies which it replaced. This was a result of the elimination of intra-euro area trade from the statistics on foreign trade and exchange transactions. However, in the longer term, the euro may become an important currency for the invoicing of foreign trade.  It should be emphasised, though, that at the global level, it will clearly take time for the euro to attain a stature comparable with that of the US dollar as the leading international transaction currency. The dollar is used as a standard for pricing in several areas, in particular in commodities trading. It usually takes a long time for changes in such conventions to take place.   6. Conclusion  In conclusion, I should like to underline once more that it is still too early to make any clear assessment of the possible role of the euro in the international monetary system. However, I am convinced that the mandate of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability in the euro area and its institutional framework, ensuring a high degree of independence, will be a good basis for developing the international role of the euro. In addition, I am convinced that the introduction of the euro will contribute to further development of the euro area financial markets with a view to achieving higher efficiency and international competitiveness. Against this background, I think there is little doubt that the euro will play a major role as an international currency.   ']\n",
      "['1999-02-01', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The euro: the new European currency', 'Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Council of Foreign Relations on 1 February 1999 in Chicago', '  The euro: the new European currency   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Council of Foreign Relations on 1 February 1999 in Chicago The euro - the new European currency - has made its debut this year. Its successful launch constitutes a milestone in the process of European integration and, in consequence, is bound to have a profound impact upon the euro area as well as the world economy in the years to come. In fact, the process of European integration started immediately after the Second World War. Its objectives were not and are not only economic, nor even primarily economic, but also political. European integration aims at the creation of a stable, prosperous and peaceful Europe. For a large part, economic integration has been the engine of this process. Economic integration has its own merits, but it is also likely to contribute to better relations among the countries concerned. And, on balance, although this process has had its ups and downs, it has been successful. However, there is no room for complacency. The introduction of the euro is an important step in this process, but it is not the end of it. New challenges lie ahead. The euro has been launched successfully but, as you know, the launch is only the start of a mission.  Following almost a decade of meticulous preparation and economic convergence, a single monetary policy for the entire euro area, encompassing almost 300 million people in eleven countries, is now determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB). This Council consists of the eleven governors of the national central banks (NCBs) of the participating Member States and the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB. Each member of this 17-member Governing Council has one vote. Monetary policy is conducted by the Eurosystem, which is comprised of the ECB and the eleven national central banks of the participating Member States. Like the FED, the Eurosystem is a federal system. Our \"Washington\" is \"Frankfurt\" in Germany, where the ECB is located. The Executive Board of the ECB which, as I have mentioned, consists of six members, is a separate decision-making body. It has to ensure that the tasks conferred upon the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are implemented, either by its own activities or through the national central banks. The ECB has currently a staff of some 600. This number will grow to around 750 in the course of this year and is likely to increase further in the years to come.       The ECB\\'s monetary policy     Let me elaborate on Europe\\'s single monetary policy framework. In accordance with the Treaty on European Union, the primary objective of the single monetary policy is to maintain price stability. Price stability is a necessary condition for promoting sustainable economic growth and better employment prospects for the citizens of the euro area. The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy announced by the Governing Council last year, and currently shaping monetary policy decisions, was conceived with the intention of making the best possible contribution to the achievement of this objective.  At the centre of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy lies the quantification of the primary objective of price stability. By announcing a quantitative definition of price stability, the Governing Council has provided a clear guide for the formulation of expectations of future price movements. At the same time such a quantitative definition has the distinct advantage of complying with the principles of transparency and accountability. This is so because, on the one hand, it clarifies how the Treaty\\'s mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council while, on the other, it gives the public a yardstick against which the success of the single monetary policy can be evaluated.  Price stability has been defined and publicly announced as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. This definition mirrors our aversion to both inflation and deflation. Hence neither price increases in excess of 2% nor deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - would be deemed to be consistent with price stability. Based on the latest data available, the current annual rate of inflation, measured on a harmonised basis at around 1%, is consistent with the definition of price stability.  Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. This emanates from the need for monetary policy to be forward-looking. It also recognises the reality that monetary policy cannot compensate for factors such as changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices that could distort price level movements in the short run.  The Governing Council of the ECB has founded its stability-oriented strategy upon two pillars. The first pillar relates to the prominent role assigned to money, given that the origins of inflation over the longer term are monetary in nature. Thus a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3, has been announced. An annual rate of 4½% has been set as the first reference value. The reference value for M3 is consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and taking account of the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3. I wish to emphasise, however, that interest rates will not be changed in a \"mechanistic\" way in order to react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term. Rather, such deviations will be regularly and thoroughly analysed for the signals that they convey about future price developments. If a deviation is considered to be posing a threat to price stability, monetary policy will then react accordingly to counter this threat.  In parallel with the evaluation of monetary growth, it is imperative to monitor a broad range of other economic and financial indicators, including economic forecasts. Thus our monetary policy strategy rests also upon a second pillar. This pillar comprises a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when formulating its monetary policy decisions.  In view of the strategy I have just described, we intend to continue with our policy of regularly informing the public of our assessment of the prevailing economic, monetary, and financial conditions as well as of specific monetary policy decisions. This will take place through a wide range of publications, press conferences and speeches intended for both the general public and a professional audience. Furthermore, the European Parliament receives the annual and monthly reports from the ECB and holds a general debate on each annual report. In addition, I appear before the relevant sub-committee of the European Parliament four times a year.  As President of the ECB, I am invited to attend the meetings of the Council of the European Ministers of Finance whenever issues of relevance to our tasks come up for discussion. The President of this Council of Ministers and a member of the European Commission may participate, without having the right to vote, in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB. Finally, I should like to mention that I am also invited to the meetings of the informal so-called Euro-11 Council. This is a forum composed of the eleven finance ministers of the Member States which have introduced the euro.       What the monetary policy of the ESCB can do     The Treaty states that the ESCB, while having price stability as a primary objective, shall support the general economic policies in the European Community; moreover, it will operate in such a way as to be consistent with the establishment of free and competitive markets. The Treaty therefore provides an explicit order of priority for the objectives: price stability is the first reference point for the monetary policy of the Eurosystem, and only within the limits of price stability can there be scope to contribute to the achievement of the other objectives of the European Community. As a consequence, the role of other Community objectives in the monetary policy of the Eurosystem is conditional upon the achievement of the overriding target of price stability.  The high unemployment rate in Europe represents the main concern of economic policy-makers. I should like to stress that the Eurosystem shares these concerns and will do its utmost to help find a solution to this problem. That said, however, we should realise that what monetary policy is able to contribute to economic policy and the reduction of unemployment, is the achievement of price stability. By creating optimal conditions for a sustainable and strong pace of economic activity, price stability will ultimately spur employment growth and foster higher living standards. The high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the consequence of structural rigidities within the European labour and product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments. The solution is thus to be found, above all, in structural reforms. The European unemployment rate has, indeed, been high and stable over the business cycles in the past decade. However, over the same period, unemployment was significantly reduced in those EU countries which succeeded in creating better-functioning labour and product markets, which allowed wages and prices to adjust when economic conditions changed. A clear example can be found in the Netherlands, where a substantial reduction in unemployment has been effected in recent years by reforming the labour market, while following the same monetary policy as Germany, where the unemployment rate is still close to 10%.  The medium-term orientation of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem should help to avoid excessive fluctuations in real economic activity. Given the fact that the Eurosystem does not aim to stabilise every short-term deviation of price developments from the predetermined path of price stability, it contributes to the stabilisation of economic activity around its long-run potential growth path. I should like to add, however, that the room for manoeuvre of monetary policy and the degree of success in terms of maintaining price stability crucially depend on the support of sound fiscal policies and responsible wage settlements in the euro area.       The links with other economic policies     I should now like to address the way in which the economic environment and the economic policies of both the Community and the governments of Member States will affect the functioning of monetary policy. A monetary policy reaction to inflationary or deflationary pressures may cause short-run fluctuations in real output. Flexible and competitive goods and labour markets, however, would soften this trade-off, thereby allowing central banks to attain the goal of price stability with less serious adverse consequences for real output. The establishment of free and competitive markets for labour, goods and services would facilitate to a large extent the functioning of monetary policy in the euro area.  Market flexibility may also help to reduce regional asymmetries in the effects of the single monetary policy. The monetary policy of the ESCB will be geared towards the euro area as a whole and will not be able to take into account purely national or regional developments. Moreover, the cyclical positions of participating countries will not completely converge at the start of Stage Three, although, with the single currency in place, some national differences may disappear over time. In the past, asymmetric shocks across European countries were sometimes dealt with via movements in the exchange rates. In the EMU environment, which is characterised by a single and uniform monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole, the required adjustments will have to stem from fiscal policies and national prices and wages, in addition to mobility of labour and capital.  Budgetary policies also play a major role in conditioning monetary policy. Sound budgetary policies enhance the credibility of monetary policy by preventing inflationary pressures. Furthermore, fiscal discipline exerts a downward influence on the risk premia embedded in nominal long-term interest rates. Moreover, given the requirements of the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, a budgetary position which is close to balance or in surplus in normal conditions may allow scope for reaction to unforeseen regional or local shocks that could bring about heavy real output losses. This would also contribute to alleviating the possible asymmetric impact of monetary policy actions on single countries.       Where do we stand at present?     Let me now turn to the operational aspects of the changeover to the new currency and the first experiences in financial markets. The start of Stage Three of EMU proved to be a formidable operation, yet it was clearly a success. In spite of the extraordinary operational risks involved, the changeover passed without any serious incident affecting the orderly conditions of the monetary system. The monitoring of the Eurosystem\\'s activities to convert the former national currencies into the euro progressed smoothly. There was no need to invoke any contingency measure, whether \"ordinary\" or \"extraordinary\". This smooth introduction of the euro was the result of years of thorough preparatory work involving the ECB, the NCBs and a large number of public and private institutions which represent the core of the financial infrastructure in the euro area. This has been reflected clearly in the way in which financial markets have received the euro.  To ensure the integration of the various money markets and the emergence of a single interbank interest rate, we have established a European payments system. This system is called TARGET and links all the large-value national payment systems in the EU. Overall, TARGET has functioned well and contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market. Some technical problems, however, could not be avoided during this start-up phase. These problems, however, were teething troubles related to participants - in both commercial banks and central banks - trying to adapt to the new system and environment. Nevertheless, during these early days of Monetary Union, TARGET has already demonstrated its capabilities in that it was able to handle more cross-border payments than were initially anticipated. The daily volumes concerned were of the order of around EUR 1,000 billion in these early days; this is equivalent to around USD 1,150 billion, depending, of course, on the exchange rate.  Our first decisions on the levels of the ECB\\'s interest rates were of course taken in accordance with the announced stability-oriented monetary policy, which I outlined earlier, and were based on the current assessment of the economic situation. With regard to monetary growth, the first pillar of the strategy, careful analysis of the most recent monetary data points to the conclusion that monetary developments are in line with the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term. The three-month moving average of the annual growth rates of M3 to December 1998 stood at 4.7%, which is very close to the reference value of 4½%.  As regards the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments, the second pillar - financial indicators - suggests that markets expect the current environment of price stability to be maintained over the medium to longer term. This outlook is supported by the significant fall observed in nominal short and long-term interest rates following the co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December. With regard to the real-side indicators for the euro area, the signals are mixed. On the one hand, euro area real GDP growth is generally expected to slow down somewhat in 1999 and business confidence, orders and capacity utilisation have been less favourable in recent months. On the other hand, the latest increase in employment figures, the acceleration in retail sales and the recent boost in consumer confidence point towards a more favourable outlook. Finally, subdued wage growth, moderate food price increases and declining energy prices have contributed to a lower rate of inflation for the euro area of just below 1%. On balance, therefore, the evidence suggests that there are no significant upward or downward pressures on the price level, at least at this juncture. Therefore, we have announced our decision to set and maintain the interest rate on our main refinancing operations at 3% for the foreseeable future.  Of course, I recognise that potential risks to price stability do exist. First, the floating and subsequent depreciation of Brazil\\'s currency has given rise to renewed fears of a disruption in world financial markets and, potentially, of a further decline in world output growth in 1999. Second, wage demands in excess of labour productivity growth and a relaxation of the fiscal stance by national governments in the euro area constitute upward risks. The Governing Council will continue to monitor all these developments very closely, and will act, should the need arise, in order to prevent either inflationary or deflationary pressures becoming entrenched.       The international role of the euro     The introduction of the euro has created a single currency area which approximately matches the United States in terms of economic size, is larger with respect to its share in total world exports and ranks only second in terms of the size of its capital market. Such an event will have important implications for the economies outside the euro area and the international capital markets. In this context, a few words seem to be in order to clarify our view on the international role of the euro and, particularly, the policy stance of the Eurosystem with regard to such a role.  With reference to the use of the euro as an international currency, I should like to remind you that the primary objective of the Eurosystem is the maintenance of price stability. Having an international currency will be advantageous for both businesses and consumers. At the same time, though, the conduct of monetary policy could become complicated should the fraction of the money stock circulating outside the euro area increase significantly. The Eurosystem does not intend either to foster or to hinder the development of the euro as an international currency. It will take a neutral stance and leave it to market forces to determine that role. There is no conscious policy of challenging the dollar. Naturally, to the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in maintaining price stability, this will in itself foster the use of the euro as an international currency. It is hard to make a prediction with regard to the pace at which the euro will emerge as an international currency. An educated guess is that the process will be a gradual one. Nevertheless, the possibility of the euro assuming a prominent role more rapidly than is perhaps suggested by past experience cannot be ruled out.  A second aspect of the international role of the euro relates to the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar or the Japanese yen. The Eurosystem in its monetary strategy deliberately does not specify a target for the exchange rate of the euro. The euro area is a large, relatively closed economy, similar in this respect to the United States. The maintenance of price stability could easily be undermined if a target for the euro exchange rate were to be vigorously pursued. Rather, in accordance with the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy strategy, the euro exchange rate will depend upon current and expected economic policies and developments and upon the interpretation markets attach to these policies and developments. The absence of an exchange rate objective against major currencies does not mean that the Eurosystem will be indifferent toward the euro exchange rate. The exchange rate is one of the indicators of monetary policy that are monitored under the second pillar of our strategy, that is the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. If its development poses a threat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be assessed and a response will be given, if considered necessary.  Moreover, the lack of a target for the euro exchange rate against the major international currencies does not necessarily mean that these rates should become more volatile. I am in favour of reasonably stable exchange rates. Who is not? However, just as a fever cannot be prevented by restricting the movement of the thermometer, we cannot ensure the absence of exchange rate pressures simply by announcing targets for exchange rates. The pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies at home constitutes a fundamental prerequisite for fostering a stable exchange rate environment. The Eurosystem\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy provides a significant contribution in this regard. Nonetheless, absolute stability of the exchange rate is impossible to guarantee. Such an outcome may not even be desirable if, for example, the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles that were not fully synchronised. Such a prospect cannot be ruled out, as even recent history has shown.  Finally, I should like briefly to touch upon the issue of the role of the ECB in international co-operation. It is clear that a central bank that acts on behalf of a monetary union comparable in economic size to the United States and which is responsible for managing a major currency is bound to play an important international role. The ECB will meet this challenge by assuming the responsibility that comes with this role. Its role will develop gradually, since it is a young institution. We will also build on the experience of those central banks which have played an important international role in the past. You may guess which central bank outside the euro area I have in mind in particular.  The ECB already participates in the work of the G-7, the G-10, the Bank for International Settlements and the OECD. Last year it was also granted observer status at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As an observer, the ECB will participate actively in the relevant work and assessment by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and of issues, such as the world economic outlook and international capital markets, that are of interest to the euro area. At the same time the ECB enjoys good bilateral relations with other central banks throughout the world. Furthermore, the ECB stands ready to take part in, and contribute to, international policy discussions, offering its expertise and exchanging views when and where appropriate. Generally speaking, the commitment of the ECB to successfully fulfilling the mandate of the Treaty, that is to maintain price stability in the euro area, will also shape the ECB\\'s international role. This is, without doubt, the best contribution the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system.       Concluding remarks     The euro - the new European currency - is a reality. The single monetary policy is in place and the Governing Council of the ECB has assumed responsibility for steering it. There is no doubt in my mind that the real challenges for the Eurosystem still lie ahead. I am confident that the Eurosystem, through its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, will stand up to these challenges and be successful in maintaining price stability in the euro area. In doing so, it will not only provide for a better future for all the citizens of the euro area but will also contribute to a stable international financial system.   ']\n",

Introduction    The birth of the euro on 1 January 1999 was an event of historic proportions. After months and years of practical preparations and testing, the new currency was delivered smoothly, if not entirely painlessly. The irrevocable euro conversion rates for the participating currencies had been adopted by the EU Council in the early afternoon of 31 December 1998. This was the starting shot for the \"changeover weekend\". During this time, billions of electronic records had to be converted from national currencies to the euro and final tests for the new payments and securities settlement infrastructure were conducted. Several thousand staff members were at work or on call within the Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the euro area. Tens of thousands more - not least in the City of London - laboured intensively in financial institutions across the globe. When the markets opened on the morning of 4 January 1999, the baptism of the new currency followed swiftly. In fact, trading in euro had already started in the Sydney market at 6 p.m. (Central European Time) on 3 January. A total of 944 banks participated in the first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem at a fixed interest rate of 3%, which was successfully completed on 5 January and settled on 7 January. In order to assist the adaptation of financial institutions to the new environment of the euro area money market, a relatively narrow corridor for the ECB\\'s standing facilities was set, as a transitional measure, for the period between 4 January and 21 January. The launch of the euro occurred in an environment of price stability that few observers would have imagined only a few years back. The year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices stood at just below 1% (the last available figure for November 1998), which is consistent with our definition of price stability. Long-term interest rates have hit record lows, which points to a high level of confidence in the ability of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability in the future. At the same time - according to current data - real activity in the euro area has, overall, held up reasonably well in the face of considerable turbulence in the global economy. The euro, which represents an economic area of 290 million people - in terms of the share of world GDP second only to the United States - will, from the very beginning, play an important international role. The health of the new-born currency will be under constant observation and critical scrutiny, both by global financial markets and by the public at large. Let me assure you that the euro\\'s immediate parents and guardians will do their utmost to see to it that the new currency will prosper and flourish and will not stray from the path of stability. With all the attention and apprehension surrounding the introduction of the euro on 1 January, it is easy to forget that this was just one, albeit very important, step on the long road of European integration. The first four weeks since the launch of the euro have made for a promising start, but this is evidently a far too short time span to assess its prospects for the future. In order to understand European Economic and Monetary Union, which has now become a reality, and in order to gauge its prospects, promises and risks, it is necessary to take a longer-term view and to look back in history. This perspective comes naturally in premises as illustrious as those in which we find ourselves this evening. Only future generations will be able to judge whether the newly born European Central Bank can pass the test of time even remotely as convincingly as the institutions of British democracy have done over the centuries.      2. A look back in history    The long process of European integration started in the immediate aftermath of World War II. It has been characterised by a combination of grand political vision and a succession of small pragmatic steps to reap the concrete benefits of bringing the economies and the people in Europe closer together. The balance between vision and realism has not always remained constant and progress has not always been steady. British leaders over the decades have made substantial contributions to the process of European integration, frequently injecting healthy doses of realism, but also, at various times, providing new ideas and leadership for Europe. Indeed, it was none other than Sir Winston Churchill who first expressed the vision of \"a United States of Europe\" in his famous speech in Zürich on 19 September 1946. As you know, however, he did not envisage that the United Kingdom, whose place would remain in the Commonwealth, would take part. As you will be equally aware, the process of integration unfolding on the continent later proved to develop a seemingly irresistible force of attraction for many countries not involved initially. This appears to confirm a general principle already noted by Aristotle. In his Politics (Book V, Chapter 6) he writes, if you allow me to quote, \"and constitutions of all forms are broken up sometimes from movements initiating from within themselves, but sometimes from outside, when there is an opposite form of constitution either nearby or a long way off yet possessed of power.\" [Aristotle\\'s Politics, Book V, Chapter 6, translated by H. Rackam MA (Heinemann, 1932).] To avoid any misunderstandings: The mechanism described by Aristotle in general terms need not work only in one direction. Indeed, in the case of Europe, integration has been a process of mutual adaptation and reciprocal influences. The continuous process of integration has, moreover, been compatible to date with a considerable degree of variation in constitutional arrangements. It is not clear to me why this should not continue to be possible in the future, as long as sufficient common ground is guaranteed. At the time of Churchill\\'s speech, most of Europe still lay in ruins. Memories of the ferocious wars and destruction that have savaged our continent this century provided powerful political inspiration for closer European integration. This was particularly true for the immediate post-war years, but it appears to hold to this day. The long shadow of the past has, in fact, also been prominent on both sides of the debate over European Economic and Monetary Union. No doubt most of you will recall the arguments raised in some quarters about monetary union as a \"question of war and peace\", on which opinions differ. The existence of such debates supports the view that monetary union cannot be understood in isolation. It must be seen in the context of the wider economic and political process of European integration. Having learned their lesson from history, Europeans - starting with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 - turned early to the creation of common, supranational institutions as an engine of integration. This was regarded as the best way to overcome national divisions in a lasting manner and to ensure that integration would be robust in the face of crises. Thus, from the inception of the ECSC to the present day, Europe has embraced a unique mixture of supranational characteristics and insistence on national sovereignty, which is perhaps quite adequately captured by the term \"European Community\". Rather than pursuing grandiose political designs, European leaders quickly focused on concrete economic issues, especially after the agreement on a European Defence Community had to be abandoned when it was not ratified in the French National Assembly in 1954. The ideal of European integration as an \"ever closer union\" was nevertheless enshrined in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the European Economic Community (and also Euratom), with the objective of creating a customs union and a common market among Member States. After this had largely been achieved in the late 1960s, the first attempt at monetary union was launched, culminating in the \"Werner Report\" of 1970, which envisaged that monetary union would be in place by 1980. This first attempt at monetary union in Europe came to nothing in the face of the world wide currency turmoil of the 1970s. As we now know, the next attempt met with success. It started with the foundation of the European Monetary System in 1979. The Single European Act and the single market programme then prompted increasing calls for further monetary integration in the late 1980s following the logic of \"one market - one money\". To a non-negligible number of observers, at the time, this logic appeared anything but compelling and a single currency anything but inevitable. Strong commitment on the part of leading European politicians brought this process, once set in place, finally to a successful conclusion. With the benefit of hindsight, the exchange rate crises of 1992-93, which for a moment had seemed set to derail the whole project, actually served to contribute to its success. In the aftermath of this experience, efforts to achieve greater economic convergence intensified and, in the end, allowed a timely launch of the single currency. The most fundamental precondition for European Economic and Monetary Union, however, was a broad consensus that monetary policy must be unambiguously focused on the objective of price stability and that this is best entrusted to a central bank that is independent from political interference.      3. Price stability and central bank independence    Central bank independence and an unequivocal commitment to price stability are the common tenets of both the monetary policy framework enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and that currently in place in the United Kingdom. It is now widely accepted - in this country and around the world - that price stability is a common good that is best safeguarded by independent central banks, which are not subject to the usual short-term pressures that characterise the political process. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, expressed this very eloquently in his statement on 6 May 1997 when he announced that the Bank of England was to be granted independence. \"A fully credible framework for monetary policy can only be built\", he said, \"if the long-term needs of the economy, not short-term political considerations, guide monetary decision-making. We must remove the suspicion that short-term political considerations are influencing the setting of interest rates\". In the words of the Chancellor, \"price stability is an essential precondition for the Government\\'s objectives of high and sustainable levels of growth and employment\". These two fundamental lessons reflect the experience in Britain and elsewhere over recent decades. In the case of Britain, like in many other countries, there had been growing disillusionment with the perpetuation of stop-and-go policies. A great number of British Chancellors have been associated with short-lived booms that later turned out to be unsustainable. As a consequence, Britain has now moved a long way towards the philosophy and institutional set-up underlying the Maastricht Treaty. In particular, it is now accepted that the appropriate objective for monetary policy is to maintain price stability over the medium term, rather than to attempt short-run macroeconomic fine-tuning. Both theoretical considerations and the empirical evidence accumulated over the years suggest that high rates of inflation are, on average, detrimental to growth and employment in the longer run. At the very least, nobody seems to be arguing that inflation is good for growth at any level. An environment of stable prices is a principal precondition for the efficient functioning of a free market economy and sustainable increases in both the standard of living and productive employment. The proposition that monetary policy should have price stability as its primary objective is not only enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, but has become increasingly consensual across the industrial world and beyond. A substantial body of research also confirms that independent central banks tend to be more successful in the pursuit of price stability than dependent central banks, without any identifiable costs in terms of output growth or volatility. In the words of Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, \"long-run price stability is one of the few legitimate \\'free lunches\\' economics has discovered in 200 years of trying. It (...) can be had for the asking.\" The principle of central bank independence is firmly entrenched in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. It is an important precondition for the successful pursuit of price stability in the euro area, but the task of the ECB will no doubt be greatly facilitated if other policy areas follow a stability-oriented course as well. The Maastricht Treaty provides for a clear division of responsibilities among policy-makers in Europe. In this context, the ECB has been created as an independent supranational institution and given the unambiguous primary objective of maintaining price stability. This set-up reflects the well-founded view that, in this way, the ECB can best contribute to the shared broader objectives of the Community, including growth, employment and social cohesion.      4. Central bank independence and accountability    While the fundamental approach to monetary policy-making is now fairly similar in the United Kingdom and in the euro area, some notable differences remain. The British public, in keeping with its long and proud parliamentary tradition, has - understandably - been particularly concerned with the issue of democratic accountability in the context of central bank independence. From this perspective, some commentators have criticised the ECB as being \"too powerful\", \"undemocratic\" and \"accountable to no one\". You will not be surprised to hear that I should like to take issue with that characterisation. As explained above, it makes good economic sense to take the responsibility for the common good of price stability outside the direct, day-to-day influence of partisan politics. Moreover, it is perfectly democratically legitimate for society to delegate authority for a particular policy area to an institution outside the regular political process. Such an institution can and will only be held accountable effectively if it is given a clear and limited mandate. If monetary policy were instead to be called upon to serve a multitude of - usually competing - goals, the status of independence would be much harder to justify and the related accountability difficult to achieve. The economic rationale for the democratic act of granting independence to central banks is the recognition that monetary policy can and should only be held responsible for the single overriding objective of medium-term price stability. If (and only if) it is agreed that price stability is a common good that should and must not be subject to the normal kind of trade-offs and value judgements which are the domain of the regular political process, would such delegation of authority appear to be wise and democratically legitimate. In the case of the ECB, the primary objective of maintaining price stability is enshrined in an international Treaty, which would be rather difficult to change. Its quasi-constitutional character, while offering greater protection from political interference, does not mean that the ECB\\'s mandate carries less democratic legitimacy. On the contrary, a Treaty concluded by 15 national governments and ratified by 15 national parliaments, in some cases endorsed in addition by a popular referendum, confers a profound and robust degree of democratic legitimacy. Once it is accepted that price stability is a lasting value and not simply a short-term objective, it appears quite legitimate to afford the ECB, as the institution entrusted with maintaining price stability, a high degree of legal protection. Accountability is the reverse side of the coin of independence. Accountability in a democracy must ultimately be achieved vis-à-vis the supreme sovereign, i.e. the people whose interests the institution must be seen to serve. The accountability of an independent institution that is not subject to the regular political process, as argued before, requires, in particular, that the institution\\'s mandate should be limited and clearly defined. Only under these circumstances can the performance of the central bank be monitored and evaluated effectively by the public. The Maastricht Treaty has assigned the ECB the single, overriding, primary goal of price stability as the basis for accountability. Moreover, the Governing Council of the ECB adopted in October 1998 a quantitative definition of price stability as \"a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". The clear definition of the ECB\\'s final objective provides the European public with a precise benchmark against which to judge its performance, for which it can and will be held accountable. The issue of accountability for the ECB\\'s performance with respect to its clearly defined mandate needs to be logically separated from concerns over the transparency of the policy-making process itself (as opposed to the outcomes of this process). Transparency, openness and clarity about how the central bank sets out to achieve its mandate are also desirable, since they reduce the degree of uncertainty in the monetary policy process and help the public to understand and assess the central bank\\'s actions. Criticism that the ECB will not be accountable for, nor transparent about, its actions is misplaced, to my mind in most cases arising purely from a lack of information. Clearly, the ECB will not and cannot be held formally and directly accountable by governments. This would contradict the very notion of full institutional independence embodied in the Treaty. Besides, of course, a European government does not exist. Given that the ECB has a clear European mandate, any formal accountability vis-à-vis national governments and even national parliaments would run counter to the logic of a single and supranational European monetary policy. The ECB is, however, committed to a high degree of accountability for its monetary policy decisions and its performance in achieving price stability vis-à-vis the European public and its elected representatives. The Treaty mandates the ESCB to submit quarterly reports as well as an annual report to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission. These reports will be debated by the European Parliament. Furthermore, the ECB\\'s President and Members of the Executive Board of the ECB can be questioned before the European Parliament\\'s Committees. In addition to the reporting requirements foreseen in the Maastricht Treaty, which are among the most stringent for any central bank, the ECB is committed to going even further in ensuring transparency and accountability. Most importantly, the President will hold an extensive press conference immediately following the first Governing Council meeting of every month. A thorough assessment of the economic environment together with special articles on topical issues are also provided in a Monthly Bulletin. The first issue of the Bulletin appeared last week. In addition, there will be working papers and occasional papers presenting the analysis and research conducted by ECB staff for scientific review. The members of the Executive Board and other members of the Governing Council will further communicate with the public very actively through regular speeches and interviews. The decision by the Governing Council of the ECB not to publish the minutes of its meetings and not to make public the voting behaviour of its members has been criticised in some quarters as a lack of accountability and transparency. In this context, one should recall that, for the purpose of accountability, what matters most will be the ECB\\'s actual track record of stability performance. Moreover, the Governing Council will strive for a maximum degree of accountability and transparency regarding its operation as a collegiate/collective body and not with respect to individual members. For that purpose it is essential to convey to the public a sense of the reasoning behind the decisions of the Governing Council and a coherent summary of the information upon which decisions are based. On the occasions of the President\\'s press conferences, a detailed assessment of the economic situation and the outlook for price developments will be given every month followed by a question and answer session. A summary of all relevant information that would normally be expected to be contained in published minutes will therefore - for all practical purposes - be immediately available, together with an opportunity to pose further questions. This goes far beyond what most central banks are prepared to do in terms of communicating with the public. It is not quite obvious to my mind that the legitimate and important cause of transparency would be advanced if central banks were to make available to the public the maximum amount of information at their disposal. You could perhaps imagine all data and records continuously being put on the Internet. You could, in addition, imagine live broadcasts of all Governing Council meetings, committee meetings, perhaps including the coffee breaks and all words uttered in the halls and corridors of power. George Orwell in reverse, if you will. Apart from all practical difficulties, would such complete openness really enhance the general public\\'s (and even the specialists\\') understanding of monetary policy? Moreover, could the public ever be sure that some important information was not withheld, some ulterior motives hidden, some decisions not revealed? The Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank stipulates that the proceedings of the meetings of the Governing Council shall be confidential, whereas the outcome of its deliberations may be made public. This is a wise decision both for reasons of internal efficiency of the decision-making process and the public\\'s perception of it. Efficient decision-making requires a frank and open discussion (and subsequent voting) based on maximum objectivity in judging the available information and policy options with respect to fulfilling the Treaty mandate. Experience shows that if individual statements during meetings are made public with the names attributed to them, a tendency simply to exchange carefully drafted - and possibly lengthy - statements can emerge. Thereby the free flow of discussion is likely to be inhibited. Similarly, voting behaviour may become more heavily influenced by tactical considerations and peer pressure rather than be based on the best judgement of the situation at hand. Perhaps more importantly, the publication of individual votes would lead the public and financial markets to focus on individual voting patterns. The Maastricht Treaty prescribes that all members of the Governing Council serve in a personal capacity as representatives of the System as a whole and on a purely European mandate. National considerations must therefore play no role in the decision-making process. It would be unrealistic to assume, at least for the initial years, that there would not be a risk that, in the public\\'s perception, individual central bank governors would still be associated with their country of origin. This would inevitably invite pressures on individual members generated by national or local interests. Such pressures would be detrimental, even if they were firmly resisted. In fact, distortions in voting behaviour to \"prove\" that one was immune from national interests and pressures could be just as damaging. Neither a \"personalisation\" of monetary policy in general, nor the specific risks of its \"renationalisation\" in the perception of the public would be helpful for establishing the reputation of the ECB as an independent and genuinely European institution which is collectively responsible and accountable for the health and stability of the single currency. I can assure you that the ECB will continuously strive for the maximum possible degree of openness and transparency in its monetary policy. This is in the interest of accountability vis-à-vis the European public. This is also in the interest of the effectiveness of monetary policy itself, which should be clearly understood by the public and the financial markets.      5. Transparency and the ECB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy    The ECB\\'s efforts to provide a high degree of both accountability and transparency are clearly reflected in its choice of monetary policy strategy. The importance of a precise definition of price stability as the basis for accountability with respect to the final goal of the ECB has already been discussed. I shall briefly review the other main aspects of the ECB\\'s strategy below. Let me first point out, however, why we feel that a central bank needs a monetary policy strategy at all. This has a lot to do with accountability and transparency, but it also concerns the internal decision-making process of a central bank.  Monetary policy is not a simple task. The transmission from the monetary policy instruments through short-term interest rates and a variety of channels to the price level is complex and may vary over time. A monetary policy strategy provides a conceptual framework that structures the processing of the vast amount of information in order to provide guidance and decision criteria to policy-makers. In terms of communication with the public, the monetary policy strategy should help the public to understand and assess monetary policy actions. The simple point to be made in this context is that openness will always be a matter of degree. It need not by itself necessarily lead to greater transparency, let alone be helpful for clarity and understanding. In the present information age we are all too aware of this. Anyone having \"surfed the Internet\" knows that the mere availability of information is not enough, the least that is required is a powerful \"search engine\" and then an ability to process and interpret the information properly. This is also a problem faced by central bankers when deciding on the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and this is why a monetary policy strategy is required. This is also the reason why - thankfully - we central bankers (and human beings in general) cannot entirely be replaced by computers. The key for the degree of transparency and clarity is therefore not the amount of information made available to the public, but the degree to which the monetary policy strategy followed within central banks truthfully corresponds to what can be communicated intelligibly to the public. An old-fashioned word for this degree of correspondence would be \"honesty\". The Governing Council of the ECB has adopted a monetary policy strategy which is neither conventional monetary targeting nor direct inflation targeting, nor a simple combination of the two. The manifold uncertainties in economic relationships accentuated by the very transition to a single currency pose substantial difficulties both for the stability of money demand as well as for the accuracy of inflation forecasts. Making a strict commitment to adjust monetary policy mechanistically in response to deviations from pre-announced monetary targets (or inflation targets at some particular horizon) in a situation of such great uncertainty would have been unwise, misleading and not credible. There would have been a great likelihood that targets would either have to be frequently missed or ignored. Despite the virtue of simplicity, it is, moreover, doubtful whether all relevant information can be usefully summarised in a single indicator like a monetary aggregate or a single inflation forecast. The \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\" decided by the Governing Council of the ECB comprises two pillars. First, a prominent role for money, in relation to which a quantitative reference value of 41/2% for the growth rate of M3 was announced in December, and, second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments. Given that inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, monetary aggregates are a natural first choice as a \"nominal anchor\" and guidepost for monetary policy. In the early years of monetary union, however, the relationships between money, prices and interest rates are likely to be subject to an exceptional degree of uncertainty. While the basic longer-run relationship between money and prices has been shown to be robust across a wide range of policy regimes, it would be risky for monetary policy, in such a situation, to respond to short-term developments of monetary aggregates in a mechanical way. The notion of a reference value for money, as distinct from a monetary target, will provide an important benchmark against which to assess monetary developments and to judge and explain policy actions. As the second pillar and in parallel with the analysis of monetary conditions, a comprehensive \"broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability\" will be conducted. Some observers have wrongly taken this to be synonymous with an inflation forecast, which is customarily at the centre of direct inflation targeting strategies, and have called upon the ECB to publish such a forecast. However, the broadly based assessment undertaken under the second pillar of the strategy will comprise an analysis of a wide range of indicator variables as well as the use of various forecasts of the outlook for price developments. Publishing any single \"official inflation forecast\" would, therefore, not adequately reflect the actual decision-making process in the Governing Council of the ECB and - rather than enhancing transparency and clarity - would actually be confusing and mislead the public. Besides, the assumptions underlying various inflation forecasts may not be fully understood by the public and the markets and could, under those circumstances, actually undermine the central bank\\'s anti-inflation credibility. For all the manifold uncertainties associated with the transition to Monetary Union, it is paramount that the ECB is understood to be strongly committed to and very clear about the final objective of price stability. This is the basis for its accountability vis-à-vis the general public. At the same time, the ECB will need to retain the necessary flexibility in interpreting and reacting appropriately to the available economic data. As described before, the ECB will go to great lengths to explain its policy decisions and the reasoning behind them to the public and thus will also aspire to the highest standards of transparency upheld by any central bank.      6. Looking ahead    The Maastricht Treaty provides the necessary foundations for a successful monetary policy. It has enshrined the principle of central bank independence, endowed with a high degree of political legitimacy, and it has assigned the ESCB the clear mandate of maintaining price stability. The Governing Council of the ECB has presented its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, which provides a coherent framework for its policy decisions and - together with the quantified definition of its overriding objective of price stability - furnishes a clear and \"honest\" basis for its accountability vis-à-vis the European public. At the same time, it takes account of the unique challenges and uncertainties facing the euro area. One should add that, of course, the ECB also has at its disposal the necessary policy instruments to implement its strategy and to attain its primary objective of price stability over the medium term. The Governing Council of the ECB has already demonstrated that it can act decisively with the co-ordinated interest rate move in early December even before the euro was born. This has reduced the uncertainty in the markets and cleared the way for a smooth start of the new currency. The past four weeks have made for a promising beginning. Thus, looking ahead, what will be the principal concerns regarding the longer-term health of the euro? There can be no doubt in anybody\\'s mind that the ECB is determined and well-equipped to maintain price stability successfully in the euro area over the medium term. It will thereby do its part in contributing to the wider objectives of the Community. In particular, safeguarding the value of the currency is a crucial precondition for long-term investment, sustainable growth and employment creation. The maintenance of price stability is a task that should never be underestimated. The appropriately forward-looking assessment of future risks of inflationary or deflationary pressures in the economy will tend to be finely balanced at any point in time. Those commentators who call for monetary policy to be simultaneously directed at objectives other than price stability often forget this. We always need to be clear about what monetary policy can do and equally what it cannot do. This brings me to the possible risks inside Monetary Union. The ECB will do its job, but can we be equally confident that everybody else will do theirs? Europe suffers intolerably high rates of unemployment. For the most part, this unemployment is structural in nature and needs to be addressed urgently through labour market reforms and increased flexibility in the wage-setting process. It is a dangerous and counterproductive illusion that any of this could be helped by printing money, quite on the contrary. Monetary Union should take away that illusion once and for all. National governments and social partners must shoulder their responsibilities and one can only hope that the introduction of the euro serves as a \"catalyst for change\" and triggers the badly needed structural reforms at the national level. There have recently been calls for greater policy co-ordination among the euro area countries. Much has been made of the clear asymmetry in the Maastricht construction, i.e. the combination of a centralised single monetary policy alongside continued national responsibilities for most other areas of economic policy-making. While this may be a reflection of political realities and the requirements of subsidiarity, it would be premature to conclude that the Maastricht construction was devoid of economic logic. On the contrary, Monetary Union, above all, calls for a greater need for flexibility as well as discipline in wage-setting and budgetary policies and a better functioning of market adjustment mechanisms. Precisely because monetary policy can no longer respond to national conditions, the exact opposite of greater centralisation and harmonisation may be required in other areas. Talk of uniform European wage-setting or an ambitious social union is going in the wrong direction; different productivity and real economic conditions across the euro area must be taken into account more than ever. Following similar reasoning, there is a strong case for retaining and even strengthening national (and in some cases \"sub-national\") responsibilities for fiscal policies. Indeed one reason for the Stability and Growth Pact being aimed at budgets that are close to balance or in surplus in normal times is to recover the room for manoeuvre for fiscal policy required to let automatic stabilisers operate effectively to smooth out national and regional business cycles. As long as the letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact are respected, national fiscal policies are free to use the remaining room for manoeuvre as best fits national circumstances and preferences. This should also be sufficient to prevent gross imbalances in the aggregate monetary-fiscal policy mix. Beyond that, it is not quite clear to me what any further \"co-ordination\", over and above the regular exchange of views and data, could possibly achieve. In particular, it would seem highly unrealistic, impractical and counterproductive if attempts were to be made at European-wide \"Keynesian-style\" fine-tuning and demand management among 11 Finance Ministers. Such attempts have proven a failure in the past, even at the national level, where the institutional preconditions would appear to be much more congenial. The Maastricht Treaty provides for a clear assignment of responsibilities. Monetary policy is centralised at the European level and has been given the single overriding objective of price stability. Fiscal policy and most other areas of economic policy-making remain largely rooted at the national level. Nevertheless, it is obvious - and the Treaty recognises this - that monetary policy does not operate in a vacuum. Unfavourable developments in other policy areas, in particular wages and fiscal polices, can place additional burdens on monetary policy and make the maintenance of price stability more difficult for the ECB. Therefore, it is natural that the ECB will participate in a continuous dialogue with European and national officials in a number of institutional settings, and we shall not hesitate to engage actively in the wider economic debate in Europe. However, this dialogue or any form of co-operation must not at any time blur the respective fundamental responsibilities. Without a clear assignment of responsibilities, policies are unlikely to be conducted in an effective and credible manner. Moreover, without it, there can be no meaningful accountability towards the ultimate sovereign - the people of Europe.      7. Monetary Union and political union    In European Economic and Monetary Union sovereignty, which in any democracy ultimately belongs to the people, is delegated to a new supranational European institution as far as monetary policy is concerned. At the same time, the Eurosystem has been assigned a clear and limited mandate, i.e. to maintain price stability in the euro area, which it is to pursue free of political interference. This \"twin transfer of sovereignty\" in the monetary field - pooled at the European level and exercised through an independent central bank - is at the heart of the Maastricht Treaty. To be successful over the longer term, the ECB as the guardian of the euro, like any institution in a democracy, will have to win and maintain the trust and support of the European public. Historically, currency jurisdictions and national borders have tended to coincide. This reflects the simple fact that the right to issue money has always been a key attribute of national sovereignty and therefore monetary union would not appear to be just a small and innocuous step of a primarily technical nature. One is indeed hard pressed to find any precedent in history, where sovereign nation states voluntarily ceded sovereignty in the monetary field to a genuinely supranational body. It is therefore clear that European Economic and Monetary Union has been and will continue to be not just an economic, but also a political project. Indeed, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the European integration process as a whole has been characterised by an interplay of political and economic forces and motivations. Perhaps in no other Member State of the European Union is the political dimension of EMU debated as fiercely as in the United Kingdom. The perceived \"loss of sovereignty\" has raised fears that the single currency might open the floodgates to a centralised European \"super state\" run by unelected and \"faceless bureaucrats\". Baroness Thatcher has famously called the Maastricht Treaty a \"treaty too far\". Others make no secret of their view that, on the contrary, it is a treaty \"not far enough\". They believe that the single currency can be used as a vehicle towards the ultimate objective of greater political union and that further integration in other policy areas would be required to make European Economic and Monetary Union work. I have always found the idea that a single currency could be used as a \"pace-setter\", which would itself trigger further political integration, to be highly doubtful and extremely risky. The stability of the currency is too important a goal in itself and must not be overburdened with not strictly related political ambitions, however worthy these may be. Indeed, some commentators, such as the Berkeley economist Maurice Obstfeld, have warned that Europe \"has taken a gamble in placing monetary unification so far ahead of political unification\". However, in this whole debate the precise meaning of political union and the link to monetary union often remain unclear. It is certainly hard to draw a direct line from monetary union to, say, a common foreign policy. What is required, to my mind, for a successful monetary union is a sufficient degree of political commitment by all participating countries, the leading economic actors and the wider public to accept fundamentally and genuinely the political and economic constraints that a single and stable currency represents. The deeper underlying commitment to make European integration a success even in the most difficult of times in history gives some general grounds for hope on this count. Some degree of political unity (not necessarily union), or rather a sense of common responsibility would appear to be important for the long-run health of EMU. However, it is not a substitute for the right economic conditions for lasting success. The Maastricht Treaty, together with the Stability and Growth Pact adopted subsequently, provides the necessary foundations for stable money, sound economic policies and a flourishing free market economy in Europe. In particular, a single European monetary policy is compatible with responsibilities for many other policy areas, remaining firmly rooted at the national level, as long as the minimum set of common objectives, principles and rules established in the Treaty are followed in letter and in spirit. Most importantly, the delegation of monetary policy to an independent and European institution does not at all contradict the basic principles of democratic legitimacy. On the contrary, because the ECB is given a precise and limited mandate, ratified by all 15 national parliaments, it can and will be held accountable effectively for its performance by the European public and its elected representatives.  My conviction that the Maastricht Treaty offers a sound and convincing framework for economic policy-making in Europe, even with the presently very limited degree of political integration in other areas, does not mean that current institutions and structures in the European Union will and should be cast in stone. All durably successful institutions need to adapt as circumstances change, as has been the case for the institutions of British democracy. This has been and will continue to be true for the further evolution of European integration. The birth of the euro four weeks ago, on 1 January 1999, is certainly not the end of history, nor is it the sudden dawn of an entirely new age. It is, however, an important milestone on the road of European integration. It is a vision that has become reality. But it is now a reality that requires a constant vigil against manifold risks and, more prosaically, continued plain hard work to turn it into a lasting success. The ECB is prepared to do its part.

      "['1999-01-25', 'Sirkka Hämäläinen', 'Finnish savers and investors in the euro area', 'Speech presented by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, on the Theme Day: From saving to investing - new forms of asset management, organised by Research foundation of the Okobank group, Helsinki, on 25 January 1999.', '  Finnish savers and investors in the euro area   Speech presented by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, on the Theme Day: From saving to investing - new forms of asset management, organised by Research foundation of the Okobank group, Helsinki, on 25 January 1999. It is now just over three weeks since the launch of the single monetary policy and the euro area-wide money markets. The impact of these changes on the lives of the average Finnish savers and investors in financial operations to date has probably been marginal - apart from the wide press coverage and the extra digits in the bank statements and pay slips of many citizens, displaying the value of markka-denominated balances in euro.  Nonetheless, the Finnish investors\\' environment has already changed significantly and will continue to change radically in the years to come.  It may be useful to divide the changes in the saving and investment domains into three main categories:      first, there are the modifications that have already taken place independent of the euro, but which will gain greater weight in the euro area;    second, we have the adjustments that have already taken place and are directly related to the single monetary policy; and    third, there are the reforms in the single currency area that can be expected to occur in stages and over the course of time.       Existing development trends in saving and investment activities  The single most significant new characteristic of the financial environment of Finnish and European savers and investors alike is the transition to an era of low inflation related to the emergence of money and capital market deregulation. Market predictability and positive real interest rates generated by sustained low inflation have meant that the established practice of investing in fixed assets has begun to wane and is being replaced by a greater demand for investment in liquid financial assets. The non-liquid market segment of housing and fixed asset investment now has a new contender of a much more liquid kind, namely equity investment. Shareholding, as such, is already widespread in Finland in the sense that holding shares or a stake in equity funds is quite common. However, as a proportion of overall investments, the asset volume of small investors remains very modest both in Finland and in most of Europe, compared with that of the United States.  Financial market deregulation and low inflation have led to a far more diversified supply of financial assets. A much wider variety of new competitive financial investment instruments now exists together with the more traditional bank deposits, such as debt securities (issued both by the public sector and private firms), units or shares in money market funds that invest in money market paper, debt securities, and equity and derivative instruments.  The changing demographic structure is another element that has a bearing on the financial savings segment. An ageing European population is leading to a position where it is no longer possible to meet all health care and pension obligations using taxpayers\\' money or by means of other public sector funds bearing a direct burden on labour costs. The narrowing financial latitude in public sector finances has made investment in voluntary pension and life assurance schemes, as well as in more liquid assets, an attractive alternative to the average consumer.  The third change affecting investment behaviour - one that both played a part in and eventually led to financial market deregulation - was and continues to be technological development. Technological evolution has made real-time data transfer and real-time asset transfer viable, it has made it possible to intercept real-time information on a far broader scale, globally in fact, and it has opened up new opportunities in the world of financial instruments, for example in the case of numerous derivative instruments. Globalisation and advanced data transfer that becomes everyone\\'s right in the Promised Land of the Internet will doubtless alter the behaviour of Finnish savers and investors, perhaps far more than we can at present envisage.  All these changes have been instrumental in bridging the gap between the Finnish and European investment environment and that of the United States. Moreover, all these developments will continue to strengthen the changes brought about by the adoption of the euro.   Changes in investment operations arising from the emergence of the euro area  The birth of the euro area has already considerably broadened the opportunities for the Finnish investor, both institutional and private.  In the past, because of the exchange rate risk, the bulk of investment was focused on domestic investment instruments, owing either to legal restrictions (e.g. insurance companies) or to a lack of experience in hedging against risk, but also due to the dearth of competitive hedging instruments. The disappearance of exchange rate risk between the 11 euro area Member States has broadened opportunities to invest in any instrument in all 11 participating Member States. The integrated market has given rise to financial markets that are both broad and deep, and to the emergence of new financial instruments.  In practice, the present options open to investors have widened to include only euro area-wide short-term money markets. These markets can in fact be construed as wholesale markets, markets that cater best for the liquidity and cash management needs of financial institutions and business investors. Indeed, for institutional investors there has been an immediate improvement in investment opportunities. The options of private investors, however, have changed only indirectly through the greater variety of financial products offered by money market funds.  Essentially, the earlier concept of \"domestic\" investment instruments has now expanded to refer to the whole of the euro area.  The real-time integration of the money markets - on the one hand essential for the single monetary policy, and, on the other, feasible thanks to the creation of the European real-time gross settlement system TARGET - has made strong progress, and will continue to strengthen this market segment. Accordingly, new market segments, such as private repo markets, will emerge. One key element in developing euro area monetary policy has been the creation of common collateral standards and, together with this, the shift to collateralised transactions (replacing earlier fiduciary transactions based on mutual trust), and progress in the harmonisation of market practices. This, in turn, has reduced risks involved in money market investment.  Fully integrated short-term liquid asset markets in the euro area, however, would fail to provide savers and investors with an opening for interest yield differentiation. The underlying principle in the single monetary policy is that markets that operate efficiently can ensure harmonised short-term interest rates across the board in the euro area. The advantage in the euro markets gained by the investor is the sheer volume and depth of the markets, making it possible to spread and minimise risk.   Forthcoming changes in the investment environment  However, the elimination of exchange rate risk between the economies of the 11 participating Member States is equally important from the viewpoint of the bond, equity and derivative markets. This provides better potential for diversifying investments from the thin Finnish markets to the broader and deeper European markets.  At this stage, however, bond and equity markets still remain segmented and nationally diversified. These investment instruments are quoted, applying varying trading practices and differing market rules and regulations, for the most part on the national stock exchanges, making direct comparison difficult for individual investors.  This notwithstanding, the near future also promises significant market harmonisation, integration and deepening on the side of the capital markets.  Harmonised market practices can be seen as a natural market-driven sequel to the ECB-steered harmonisation process on the short-term markets. The European Commission survey commissioned by the Ministries of Finance of the respective Member States last spring, which was designed to disclose cross-country differences in legislation on financial market services, clearly serves this purpose. The aim is, for example, to harmonise the contents and to enhance the acceptance of stock exchange brochures and press releases, to scale down the number of institutional investment restrictions and to harmonise legislation on collateral throughout the euro area.  It is realistic to assume and indeed to anticipate that market forces will soon drive the capital markets - bonds and equities alike - towards more centralised operations in the big financial centres of Europe. This can already be seen in the existing alliances and alliance and merger talks between major European stock exchanges, and, beyond that, in the linking of smaller stock exchanges to the satellite networks of bigger centres. This does not mean that trading on the smaller, national stock exchanges will cease altogether, as limited trading in domestic securities is bound to continue. However, markets extending across the whole of Europe that are centralised, transparent, deep and liquid nonetheless offer great potential for Finnish savers and investors.  Common interest in the euro as an official reserve and investment currency will also pave the way for wider capital markets in the euro area. The capital markets of the euro area are as yet unable to compete fully with the deep, liquid and versatile markets of the United States. However, with the euro being seen as a major international currency and clearly construed as a potential vehicle for spreading investment risk in both central bank reserves outside the euro area and those of private investors, it seems probable that demand will soon drive the markets to greater efficiency and diversity. The markets are heralding greater depth and improved liquidity. New, clearer benchmark practices are on the horizon, making it easier to compare the terms and conditions and credits of different issuers. More efficient and better co-ordinated credit risk assessments can be made, not only of issuers, but also of individual securities, making it considerably easier to compare the risks involved. Above all, the variety of instruments promises to become wider, especially as regards maturities and collateral. Hand in hand with increased variety comes greater transparency and enhanced comparability across the different options.  The market segments that foretell change on the European capital markets are the bond markets, where the volume of bonds issued by private firms is likely to grow, and the stock markets, where greater expansion and further integration are envisaged. In other words, European markets and instruments will begin to resemble the North American markets in this context too. Cuts in public sector deficits and reduced debt burdens lead to a smaller volume of government bonds, thus creating room for bonds issued by private enterprises and providing incentives for companies to raise funds on the wide, efficient markets. In these conditions of low inflation, the low interest rates on financial assets make equities an attractive option for lucrative investment.  From the viewpoint of individual investors, these developments offer more alternatives, but, by the same token, they also highlight the saver\\'s and investor\\'s own responsibility for making the choice between higher yields with greater risk, on the one hand, and lower yields with lower risk, on the other.  In this context, the developments occurring independently of the euro, which I discussed above, play a key role. Low inflation and low interest rates imply low nominal rates of return, but yield expectations (especially regarding returns on pension savings, both in relation to pension funds\\' and private individuals\\' investment activities) are invariably demanding. This compels investors actively to assess and monitor the risk/reward ratio on the markets, i.e. it calls for far more active and professional investment behaviour than before. A more active approach by investors can be expected to emerge as skills in exploiting computer technology and information technology improve. That is to say, the disposition of Finnish and European investors towards more \"Americanised\", that is, more skilled and dedicated behaviour in financial operations is bound to grow in the near future, notably when related to their own household finances.  This trend, one in which I myself believe, gives rise to a number of implications and challenges in different segments of the economy:    It is a challenge to the Finnish banking system, to the insurance companies, and to all those in the financial services sector. Rapidly developing securitisation could become a serious alternative to bank deposits. The elimination of exchange rate risk, enhanced efficiency on the financial markets and in services across the whole of Europe, and advanced technological solutions and skills of investors are sure to create strong competitive pressure, not only in investment activities but also in lending operations.    Will financial institutions in Finland be able to make the appropriate adjustments in operations and devise competitive and adequate services for customers, for example in investment services and in mutual fund activities, in order to withstand these changes?    A tougher investment environment means that differences in expertise tend easily to lead to disparity between savers and investors. Those that possess a higher level of education and take an interest in information technology inevitably become better investors and succeed in strengthening their financial position, whereas those with a lower level of education and little interest in information technology may end up suffering losses. This in itself is no different than before: in conditions of high inflation a similar discrepancy also existed, where inflation ate away at pensioners\\' bank savings, while those able to invest in real property through debt financing stood to gain.    The new investment environment also challenges society to offer appropriate basic training in economics and information technology skills as equitably as possible. This should also prompt financial service operators and firms to offer services to small investors and savers that are both cost-effective and competitive.    Bringing about change in investment behaviour and in the structure of investment assets also brings new challenges for economic policies, both European-wide monetary policy and national fiscal policy. Where previously the vast majority of all savings were in the form of owner-occupied housing and bank deposits, sensitivity to changes in short-term interest rates reacting to money market fluctuations was high. Likewise, sensitivity to price fluctuations in fixed assets deriving from taxation, housing policy and general short-term economic policy was also considerable.    With a growing and more diverse market share of assets taking the form of longer maturities and with shareholdings on the rise, investors are becoming more dependent on market-driven expectations, as reflected in long-term interest rates and in stock quotations. In the same vein, the \"Americanised\" consumer behaviour of savers makes these assets more prone to fluctuations than before. The effects of both European monetary policy and of national fiscal policy are thus lessened. A long-ranging approach and effective prevention of speculative bubbles are the challenges faced by today\\'s economic policy-makers.  A key feature in current developments lies in fostering the role of the financial markets as a broker for the efficient allocation of capital, and in ensuring potential growth in productive activities and employment prospects in all of Europe. Indeed, these constitute key objectives of the whole EU and euro project. However, changes are also the harbinger of adjustment pain, and Finland is very familiar with this. Timely preparation and early adjustment would alleviate this pain.  A crucial question is how swiftly Finnish savers and investors will become aware of the changes that have taken place and are able to modify their own behaviour accordingly, and how fast and efficiently the Finnish financial system can prepare for these changes in investment activities. Finnish history over the past 15 to 20 years leaves quite a lot to be desired in this respect, as behavioural changes have traditionally occurred slowly in Finland. The question which we must now ask ourselves is whether this \"tradition\" is likely to continue into the 21st century?   ']\n",

Duisenberg, at the New Year's reception organised by Deutsche Börse on 25 January 1999, at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Frankfurt am Main\", '  Monetary policy in the euro area   Speech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, at the New Year\\'s reception organised by Deutsche Börse on 25 January 1999, at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Frankfurt am Main Thank you for the invitation to speak at this New Year\\'s reception. 1999 is a special year: the year in which the euro was launched, and the year in which it will have to become a stable currency. This is the challenge which lies ahead. The introduction of the euro was a very happy event for all involved. The euro is present on all major financial markets around the globe. Currency trading in euro has commenced and for three weeks now shares have been denominated in euro on most European stock exchanges. Although not yet embodied in the physical form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play an important role, both in the euro area and beyond. The euro is a symbol of the achievements of Europeans in the pursuit of common goals. It is unprecedented in European history. After years of intensive preparations and successful efforts towards convergence, the single monetary policy for the entire euro area is being determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The Governing Council of the ECB, which comprises the Governors of the 11 national central banks of the participating Member States plus the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB, has assumed this responsibility and is in charge of monetary policy decisions for the euro area. Decisions by the Governing Council will be implemented via the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks (NCBs). Indeed, the introduction of the euro marks the culmination of much successful preparatory work over a period of many years. This has been reflected in the very positive and confident way in which financial markets have received the euro in the first three weeks of Monetary Union. Moreover, the enormous technical and logistical challenges posed during the changeover weekend at the start of the year have been surmounted.  Monetary Union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability within the euro area. It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people. Price stability is at the core of the \"stability culture\" that we are seeking to establish throughout Europe. By fulfilling the unequivocal commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to maintaining price stability in the euro area, we shall ensure that the single monetary policy contributes as much as possible to economic welfare in the broadest sense. At the same time, national fiscal authorities and general economic policies also have to demonstrate their commitment to the creation of this stability culture in Europe. In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact is a crucial element. Its aim is to foster the pursuit of disciplined and sustainable fiscal policies in the euro area. In so doing, it can make a significant contribution to the establishment of favourable conditions for sustained economic growth and high employment in the medium to long term. It would be counterproductive if national fiscal policies started to discontinue their efforts in the light of the achievement of Monetary Union and the currently positive price outlook. I am not fully convinced that consolidation efforts are currently being undertaken with sufficient determination in all participating Member States. Monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe\\'s economic problems. Appropriate structural reforms implemented by national governments are of the utmost importance. Much progress is required in this broad area. Moreover, continued wage moderation in both the public and private sectors would contribute to the reduction of the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area. Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin. Implementing too lax a monetary policy will not solve this problem, but rather exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment and savings decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism. Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility and efficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner. I appreciate that such reforms are not always easy, not least because the benefits which they yield occur mainly in the medium to long term. However, they are unavoidable. In those euro area Member States that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly. Other euro area Member States should and must take note: structural reform throughout the euro area is fundamental to the success of Monetary Union and to improving Europe\\'s economic performance. In this respect, we may also be able to learn something by looking at the reasons behind strong employment growth and low unemployment in some of the Member States of the European Union and in the United States, in particular regarding the flexibility of labour markets and the incentives to create and accept new jobs. Today, I shall describe the main features of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which underlie our single monetary policy. Against this background, I shall briefly explain the recent monetary policy decisions adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB. Finally, I shall summarise how we currently see the outlook for maintaining price stability in the euro area.   I. The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy  The Treaty on European Union, commonly referred to as the \"Maastricht Treaty\" assigns the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. In order to steer expectations of future price developments, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective. This clarifies how the Treaty\\'s mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public clear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. According to the published definition, price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Neither would deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - be consistent with price stability. The annual rate of inflation in the most recent available data of around 1%, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability. The Eurosystem has therefore enjoyed the good fortune to assume authority over monetary policy in the euro area in an environment of price stability, owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence achieved within Europe over the past decade. Monetary policy needs a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. This takes into account the fact that monetary policy affects the price level only with variable, usually long and unpredictable time lags. It is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level. To maintain price stability, we have chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present as well as those likely to prevail in the foreseeable future. The chosen strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the former strategies of the NCBs. At the same time, it gives due consideration to the unique situation which will prevail in the early years of Monetary Union.  The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy rests on two \"pillars\". The first pillar is a prominent role for money. This is deemed to be important on account of the essentially monetary origins of inflation over the longer term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth, to look at a wide range of financial and other economic indicators, including economic forecasts. This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well-informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions.  Monetary developments can reveal useful information about future price developments and thereby offer an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for any central bank entrusted with the task of keeping prices stable to analyse and monitor the developments of monetary aggregates closely. Consequently, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for broad monetary growth as measured by M3, which should, under normal circumstances, give some indication of future inflationary pressure. The choice of M3 as an aggregate is supported by empirical evidence regarding the long-run stability and leading indicator properties of this aggregate. Moreover, conceptual arguments pointed to the considerable importance of including in the monetary aggregate those assets which have a high degree of substitutability with narrower definitions of money. Therefore, in addition to currency in circulation and deposits, repos, units or shares of money market funds and money market paper as well as short-term debt securities, all of which are close substitutes for more traditional bank deposits, have also been included in this definition. The first reference value for M3 growth has been set at an annual rate of 4½%. This reference value is consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3. In setting the reference value for monetary growth, the Governing Council has taken account of various factors and emphasised its medium-term orientation. First, the Governing Council is committed to maintaining price stability according to the definition enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. This requires increases in the HICP for the euro area of \"below 2%\". Second, the Governing Council takes the view that a figure in the range of 2% to 2½% per annum for the trend growth in real GDP in the euro area appears to be reasonable. Third, the uncertainties concerning short-term developments in velocity linked to the start of Stage Three have led the Governing Council to assume that the medium-term trend decline in velocity lies approximately within a range of ½% to 1% each year. This range reflects historical experience over the past twenty years. Substantial or prolonged deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value should, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability in the medium term. Monetary policy does not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a \"mechanistic\" way. In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed to infer any signals which they may offer about the prospects for price developments. If the deviation points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempt to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term. Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will not constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to take appropriate policy decisions. There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators.  At the same time, relying on a single forecast that attempts to summarise all the information available from a wide range of indicators would be misguided. The Governing Council does not react mechanistically to a single variable - whether this be a forecast, the exchange rate, unit labour costs or fiscal indicators - but rather takes into account the complete picture offered by all available and meaningful leading indicators of future inflation. In this context, the Governing Council analyses the economic reasons behind the projected risks to price stability. The appropriate monetary policy response to a threat to price stability will depend on the nature of the threat. The Governing Council can only understand the nature of the risk if it is presented with a full set of data. From these, it can attempt to identify the nature of the disturbance to price stability. Having identified the threat, an appropriate policy response can be selected and implemented. Internal forecasts of economic activity and inflation in the euro area can also contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy. However, the Eurosystem should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy of its internal forecasts. Thus, publication of the forecasts cannot contribute to accountability. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability in the medium term should be used by the public to judge the success of the Eurosystem.  Allow me to say a few words on certain proposals made in the recent public debate, which may be deemed to suggest that the focus of monetary policy should be shifted towards objectives other than price stability. Indeed, some recent suggestions seem to imply that the Eurosystem should react more or less automatically to exchange rate movements or other specific variables such as unit labour costs.  The Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy stance is not one of benign neglect with respect to the exchange rate. The Eurosystem\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy takes into account the external value of the euro as one, potentially important, determinant of the outlook for price stability. Obviously, if a strong and abrupt appreciation of the euro were to occur, this would lead, all other things being equal, to downward pressures on price developments. In such a situation, there would be a stronger reason for lowering the ECB\\'s interest rates, which might then, in turn, help to counteract part of the prior exchange rate movement.  However, monetary policy reactions to the exchange rate, or to any other variable, can never be mechanistic or automatic. According to its stability-oriented strategy, the Eurosystem always has to analyse carefully a wide set of indicators, the nature of any disturbances and their implications for the overall outlook for price developments in the medium term. In any case, it must be borne in mind that the Treaty on European Union also requires the single exchange rate policy to respect the primary objective of price stability. Thus, the ECB cannot commit itself in advance to any specific reaction with respect to the exchange rate.  I am sure you would agree with me that it would not necessarily be appropriate to tighten the monetary policy stance simply because the euro had depreciated, if, at the same time, we were in a recession with increasing downward pressures on prices. As such mechanistic reactions to exchange rate developments could easily endanger price stability and destabilise economic developments in the euro area, we deliberately excluded any kind of exchange rate targets or target zones from our strategy.  In line with its clear mandate enshrined in the Treaty, and for sound economic reasons, the ECB has to decide which monetary stance best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term and then act accordingly. At the same time, the Treaty also emphasises the need for sound fiscal policies. This clear separation of responsibilities is both efficient and transparent. The Eurosystem is open, transparent and, above all, accountable for its performance. As part of its communication strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB regularly informs the public about changes in its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and about specific monetary policy decisions. The Governing Council meets every fortnight. The first meeting in every month is immediately followed by a press conference and the release of the President\\'s Introductory Statement, which is a summary of the conclusions of the Governing Council with regard to its assessment of monetary, financial and other economic developments. This is similar to what other central banks call minutes. We are convinced that this very prompt delivery of information serves the interests of the public in an optimal way. I do not think that many central banks publish their minutes only a few hours after the meeting of their governing body. I am also convinced that it is in the public interest for the view of the whole Governing Council to be presented, rather than the views of individual members. Moreover, the ECB has just published its first edition of the Monthly Bulletin, and will publish an Annual Report. We shall also explain our policies on a regular basis in speeches and interviews, also making a presentation to the European Parliament at least four times a year.   II. Recent monetary policy decisions and operations  Co-operation among European national central banks has always been close and, among participants in Stage Three, it has become increasingly so in recent years and months. The co-ordinated reduction of the key interest rates by all central banks of the euro area in December 1998 clearly demonstrated that Monetary Union had begun de facto before the start of Stage Three. This co-ordinated measure contributed to the stabilisation of market expectations. The Governing Council of the ECB announced that the new level of the euro area-wide key interest rate of 3% would prevail \"for the foreseeable future\". In other words, in the absence of further disturbances to the economy or the emergence of new and unanticipated threats to price stability, this level of interest rate is considered to be consistent with the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term. Our announcement helped to resolve some uncertainty at a time when the practical, technical and logistical tasks required by the changeover weekend were uppermost in our minds and in those of market participants. The first main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem were successfully settled. While paying due attention to the uncertainties related to the phasing-in of the new system, the decisions were taken on the basis of the liquidity conditions prevailing in the euro area money market as a whole. In addition to the refinancing operations, the Eurosystem offers standing facilities, which can be accessed by credit institutions via the NCBs. The deposit and marginal lending facilities constitute, in normal circumstances, the upper and lower bound for the overnight market interest rate. As a transitional measure, the Governing Council of the ECB had narrowed the corridor established by the interest rates on the Eurosystem\\'s standing facilities from 4 January until 21 January 1999. The intention was to facilitate the necessary adjustments to the new institutional environment resulting from the transition to Stage Three. At its last meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two next main refinancing operations the same conditions will apply as for the three main refinancing operations settled earlier this month. This means they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0% Furthermore, the Governing Council confirmed that it did not see a need for continuing the application of the narrow interest rate corridor beyond the date of 21 January 1999. It was thus decided to revert to the interest rates on the Eurosystem\\'s two standing facilities, which it had set for the start of Stage Three. It set the marginal lending rate at a level of 4.5% and the deposit rate at 2.0% with effect from 22 January 1999. This decision has to be seen against the background of the experience with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market since the beginning of the year. Difficulties of some market participants with the functioning of the area-wide money market have diminished substantially over time. As a consequence, overall, the integration of the euro area money market has therefore reached a satisfactory state only three weeks after its creation.  The first regular longer-term refinancing operation, which was conducted using parallel tenders with three different maturities of one, two and three months, was also settled successfully on 14 January 1999. It was conducted as a standard variable rate tender, using the single rate allotment procedure. In contrast to the main refinancing operations, these longer-term market operations are not aimed at signalling the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy stance. The ECB announces standard allotment volumes in advance. Therefore, interest rates from these operations are to be seen as indicators of market conditions.   III. Regular assessment of monetary, financial and economic conditions  Finally, I should like to report on the Governing Council\\'s regular assessment of monetary, financial and economic conditions. We consider the current monetary trend for the euro area to be compatible with continued price stability in the euro area. The 12-month growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 decreased from 5.0% in October 1998 to 4.5% in November 1998. The three-month moving average of M3 (covering the months September to November 1998) stood at 4.7%, i.e. very close to the reference value of 4½% per annum.  With respect to the broadly based outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, financial market developments may be seen as indicating a favourable assessment of the recent monetary policy decisions of the Eurosystem, signalling that financial market participants expect the environment of price stability to continue. In this connection, I could mention the fall in long-term interest rates at the start of 1999 to new historical lows and the fact that the yield curve has shifted downwards. Indeed, conditions for investment at the start of Monetary Union are favourable. This relates, in particular, to the currently prevailing low interest rate level, which significantly reduces the costs of financing for investors. Economic growth in the euro area has become more broadly based, as is reflected in private consumption and investment.  At the present juncture, the outlook for the euro area economy is still very much influenced by the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999. These uncertainties have adversely affected indicators of industrial confidence in the euro area and have fuelled expectations of a slowdown in economic activity in the short term. In part, the deteriorating external environment, which has its origins in the Asian and Russian financial crises, places a high burden on overall growth prospects. The picture, however, is mixed. Order books and capacity utilisation point to a less optimistic outlook, while retail sales and the recent pattern in employment and unemployment suggest more favourable trends. Consumer confidence also remained high until late 1998. In general, this pattern of mixed evidence appears to characterise the economic situation in the euro area around the turn of the year, and we shall continue to monitor developments carefully. I should also like to emphasise that the Governing Council carries out a forward-looking assessment of inflationary pressures and carefully assesses risks to price stability, whatever direction these may take. With respect to the latest data on the HICP, the annual increase for November 1998 showed a further slowdown to 0.9%, compared with 1.0% in the two previous months. This development was in line with previous trends. It was mainly due to lower annual percentage changes in the prices of food and a further reduction in energy prices. A significant contribution was also made by moderate wage increases. In combination with high overall productivity gains throughout the whole economy, a reduction in unit labour costs was reported. On balance, the described overall economic environment and all available forecasts for 1999 do not point to significant upward or downward pressure on price developments in the short term. Nevertheless, factors contributing to risks to price stability on both sides need to be taken into account. On the one hand, downward risks relate to the global environment and potential repercussions on the euro area, for example via import prices and further pressure on producer prices. These developments will be monitored closely. On the other, unexpected upward pressure on wages and a relaxation of the fiscal stance would clearly alter the general environment. Therefore, we shall also carefully monitor the outcome of ongoing wage rounds, the plans for fiscal policy in 1999 and over the medium term, as well as the implementation of such plans in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. In summary, the current situation, which is characterised by monetary growth compatible with continued price stability and the absence of immediate upward or downward pressure on price developments, justifies maintaining the current monetary policy stance, with an ECB interest rate of 3% for the main refinancing facility. Indeed, monetary policy in Stage Three started with very low interest rates by historical standards.   ']\n",

Today, just a little more than two weeks after this historic event, it is a great privilege for me to be here at the European Parliament for another exchange of views with your committee. I should like to begin my statement by reviewing the changeover to the euro, including money market developments during the first two weeks of the single currency. I shall then go on to summarise the assessment by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the economic environment in which the new currency has been launched and which has shaped our initial decisions about monetary policy. Moreover, I shall comment on some of the challenges that lie ahead. Finally, I shall touch briefly upon some issues related to the communication policy of the European Central Bank, after which I shall, as usual, stand ready to answer any questions you might have.   A. Transition to the euro  The transition of the banking and finance community from the national currencies to the euro in only three and half days after the publication of the conversion rates, was, indeed, a success. The smooth migration of all electronic systems and procedures was a sign of the quality of the preparatory work carried out over recent months and years. In our view, the workforce that was directly involved in the changeover in the global financial markets - including all major financial centres outside the euro area - was probably higher than the 50,000 reported by the media. Within the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks (NCBs), preparations had been ongoing for some time. The first plan of action for the changeover weekend had already been approved by the EMI Council in March 1998. After the establishment of the ECB, the Governing Council examined reports on the changeover at four of its meetings. During the changeover weekend several thousand staff members were at work or on call at the ECB and the NCBs. The major concern of the Governing Council was to avoid a breakdown in the transition to the euro - at the ECB, at any NCB or within any of the systems of the \"core infrastructure\" of financial markets in the euro area. For this reason, the ECB made recommendations to credit institutions and securities settlement systems and set up a procedure for monitoring developments within and outside the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) during the weekend. Moreover, the decision-making bodies of the ECB stood ready to convene extraordinary meetings via teleconference and to adopt, if needed, contingency measures. The latter was not necessary. The monitoring of conversion activities conducted by the ESCB during the changeover weekend revealed no incident that might have impaired the smooth start of Monetary Union. As to the involvement of the Eurosystem in the changeover activities, I should like to mention that I had the honour of attending the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 31 December 1998, during which the conversion rates were irrevocably fixed. I delivered personally to the ECOFIN Council the Opinion of the ECB on the proposed conversion rates. On the morning of 31 December, the Eurosystem had contributed to the computation of the conversion rates. Later on, the Governing Council had, with the participation of the national central bank governors of the countries not adopting the euro at the start of Stage Three, a meeting by means of a teleconference to approve its legal Opinion. The Eurosystem also contributed to the dissemination of the conversion rates in a prompt and secure manner to the banking and finance community, as requested by market operators in order to enable them to start their conversion activities as soon as possible in the early afternoon of 31 December. In addition, on 31 December 1998 the euro central rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma in ERM II were agreed by written procedure between the relevant parties. The new central rates are in line with the previous ones, after allowing for minor deviations due to rounding. Moreover, the ECB, Danmarks Nationalbank and the Bank of Greece established by common accord and announced, on the same day, the compulsory intervention rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma. Fluctuations of the two currencies during the first two weeks of the year remained subdued.   B. Market developments in the first two weeks of January  With a view to ensuring a smooth transition to the euro, the Governing Council took two important decisions already on 22 December 1998, in order to give guidance to the markets on the monetary conditions at the outset of Monetary Union. First, it was decided to start the provision of liquidity via the first tender operation, which was carried out in the first week, at a fixed rate of 3%. The Governing Council also agreed that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility would be set at 4.50% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2%. Together, these two rates form the so-called \"corridor\" for movements in short-term rates. However, the Governing Council considered the possibility that market participants may need some time to accustom themselves to the new environment for monetary policy. To this end, it was decided to use a relatively narrow corridor of interest rates for the standing facilities of the Eurosystem in the first three weeks of Stage Three as an automatic device to reduce the maximum range of fluctuations in the overnight interest rate. Accordingly, the Governing Council temporarily introduced an exceptionally narrow corridor of only 50 basis points, with the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2.75%. This measure will be terminated on 21 January 1999. Indeed, this guidance given to the markets proved to be justified, since market developments over the first days showed that the formation of the single European money market would not happen overnight.      There were signs that short-term market rates in the different countries were not fully aligned and, in particular, that the spreads between the highest and lowest rates were larger than is normal in an integrated money market.    The counterparties of the Eurosystem made very high use of the marginal lending facility at 3.25% (EUR 27.5 billion on Monday, 4 January), since this rate was only slightly higher than the prevailing market conditions for overnight borrowing in the euro area. The overnight EONIA rate for effective market transactions was 3.20% and credit institutions may have preferred to pay a slightly higher rate instead of entering into market transactions with other banks across the borders    The counterparties also deposited large amounts overnight with the Eurosystem (EUR 9.2 billion), as they may not have been willing or able to lend them to other market counterparties.      In the meantime, this situation has been overcome. The spread between the highest and the lowest rates reported to the ECB by banks of the EONIA (Euro Overnight Index Average) panel has narrowed from 21 basis points on 4 January to below 10 basis points. Moreover, the use of the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility has been significantly reduced to a more normal level. A further confirmation of the increasing integration of money markets in the euro area is the growing use of payment and securities settlement systems. On 5 January 1999 the value of cross-border transactions settled through TARGET had already exceeded EUR 310 billion. Including domestic real-time gross settlement (RTGS) transactions, which themselves accounted for at least another EUR 660 billion, the total value of transactions settled was therefore almost EUR 1,000 billion. This amount corresponds to about 17% of last year\\'s GDP of the euro area. In the meantime, the total volume of transactions has increased further. Moreover, the extensive use of the so-called correspondent central banking model (CCBM) - a mechanism which permits banks to make cross-border use of eligible assets as collateral in monetary policy operations and payment systems - suggests that market integration is proceeding well. The TARGET system, the cross-border payment system of the ESCB, has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market and it has made possible the consolidation of the treasury management of institutions with different activity centres throughout Europe. TARGET has processed more cross-border payments than anticipated in these early days of Monetary Union and, in so doing, has amply demonstrated its processing capacities. Given the extensive use of the system, the ECB recently decided to extend the operating hours of the TARGET system by one hour to 7 p.m. for a limited period ending on 31 January 1999. This should alleviate some of the time pressure on commercial banks when familiarising themselves with the TARGET rules. Similarly, the Governing Council decided that, during this transition period, the deposit facility of the Eurosystem would be available until one hour after the closure of TARGET. I should like to also mention the results of the two first main refinancing operations of the ECB. EUR 75 allocated at a fixed rate of 3% to the banking system under the first operation, while the amount for the second operation was, under the same conditions, EUR 48 billion. In addition, on 13 January 1999 the ECB allocated EUR 45 billion in three tranches with maturities of 42, 70 and 105 days through its first longer term financing operation, at marginal single rates of respectively 3.13 %, 3.10 % and 3.08 %. We have provided sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions, on aggregate, to neutralise their monetary reserve deficit relatively soon within the first reserve maintenance period.   C. Current economic developments and prospects  The Governing Council\\'s decisions on the initial level of interest rates for the euro area, announced on 22 December 1998, have been made with a view to the objective of maintaining price stability. The decisions were taken on the basis of a thorough assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area and against the background of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. As you will be aware, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of price stability, measured on the basis of a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. The monetary policy strategy further consists of two key elements; first, a reference value of 4 1/2% for annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 and, second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability. The views of the Governing Council on the monetary and financial situation, the economic conjuncture and prospects for price developments in the euro area which underpinned its decisions on the appropriate monetary policy stance to be adopted were set out at a press conference at the time of the announcement. In addition, a more detailed assessment of the economic situation underlying the Governing Council\\'s monetary policy decisions will be released in the ECB\\'s first Monthly Bulletin, to be published tomorrow. This will include a commentary on the economic situation in the euro area. Let me briefly summarise the main features of our assessment of the current economic situation and outlook. As regards monetary developments, which are monitored on the basis of a three-month moving average of the 12-month growth rate of M3 (in order to minimise distortions from erratic monthly figures), the Governing Council set the first reference value at 4 1/2%. The latest three-month moving average of annual growth in M3 was around 4.7%, which is very close to the reference value and compatible with the maintenance of price stability. A broader assessment of economic and financial developments supported the available monetary data in signalling the absence of significant upward or downward pressures on prices. Financial indicators suggested that market participants expect the current climate of price stability to continue in the medium to longer term. In this context, it may be observed that at the start of Stage Three nominal short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro area have reached levels which are very low by historical standards and that real interest rates are also significantly below their long-term averages. The real long-term interest rate is currently at a level of about 3 %, which is approximately 1 percentage point below the level prevailing at the end of 1997. Increases in consumer prices, as measured by 12-month-changes in the HICP, have been around 1% since autumn 1998, falling to 0.9% in November. The rate of increase in service prices has remained unchanged at around 2%, but increases in goods prices are much lower, at 0.3%, reflecting downward influences on both food and industrial consumer goods prices. Energy prices have also continued to contribute to moderate price developments, falling by 4.3% in the 12 months to November. In addition, modest developments in unit labour costs are a further key factor underpinning the current low rate of consumer price increases. The preliminary data released by EUROSTAT for the third quarter of 1998 showed euro area-wide real GDP growth at 2.4%, thus reflecting some deceleration compared with the first half of the year when output growth averaged 3%. Growth has increasingly been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports in the course of 1998. Private consumption, in particular, has been robust, supported by growth in employment. However, unemployment in the euro area remains very high (at 13.8 million) and is declining only gradually. In the short term, output growth is expected to slow somewhat as a consequence of a weaker global environment. In addition to the lower real GDP growth figure in the third quarter, further evidence of an economic slowdown has been provided by survey data, most notably on order books and industrial confidence, which have weakened significantly since the spring of 1998. Industrial production growth also slowed during the course of last year. By contrast, consumer confidence was quite resilient, providing some support to domestic demand. There is considerable uncertainty about the impact of external developments on the euro area, not least because of recent events in Brasil, but the slowdown is currently expected to be temporary. The current low levels of short and long-term interest rates in the euro area should contribute to sustained confidence and domestic demand. Overall, the Governing Council felt that the risks to price stability appear to be balanced. However, there is a potential downside risk to the global situation, which could lead to lower inflation via a more pronounced growth slowdown in the euro area and weaker import and producer prices. On the other hand, higher-than-expected wage increases and/or a relaxation of the fiscal stance could lead to higher price increases. The ECB will continue to monitor these developments closely.   D. Challenges ahead  Looking ahead, the introduction of the euro and a stability-oriented monetary policy will contribute significantly to the creation of the conditions necessary for improved growth and employment prospects. However, important challenges remain, two of which I should like to mention in particular:      In order to achieve a sustained and substantial reduction in unemployment, it remains necessary to press ahead with structural reforms to labour and product markets. As I have already mentioned, the rate of unemployment in the euro area has remained very high, at 10.8%, despite real GDP growth of around 3% in the first half of 1998. Monetary policy will play its part by continuing to pursue its objective of maintaining price stability, thus helping to keep inflationary expectations and risk premia in long-term interest rates low. Some benefits from price stability have already been seen in the decline in long-term interest rates to below 4% by the end of last year. Moreover, as I have already mentioned, real long-term interest rates have also declined substantially. However, while this should foster investment and employment growth, it cannot by itself reduce structural unemployment.    Fiscal imbalances, reflected in both current deficit and debt levels in relation to GDP, are also a major challenge. A sound and sustainable policy framework is characterised by fiscal policies which are consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact. Compared with the progress in fiscal consolidation achieved in previous years, only a small reduction in the euro area-wide budget deficit is estimated to have occurred in 1998: to 2.3 % from 2.5% in 1997. Moreover, the decline was the result of favourable cyclical developments together with savings in interest payments. After adjusting for the cyclical effects of stronger growth, the \"structural deficit\" actually worsened somewhat in 1998. According to the European Commission, this is the first such deterioration since 1991. The ratio of euro area general government debt to GDP is estimated by the European Commission to have been 73.8% in 1998, which is well above the reference level of 60%. Deficit ratios are still too high to put debt levels on a rapidly declining path. Fiscal plans should thus be aimed at ensuring early compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which includes a commitment to achieving fiscal positions \"close to balance or in surplus\" in the medium term. This is also required in order to allow automatic stabilisers to work without exceeding the 3% deficit ceiling in less prosperous times.       E. Communication policy of the Eurosystem  Coming now to the last part of my statement, I should like to touch briefly upon some decisions related to the ECB\\'s communication policy that have been taken recently. As you might be aware, the ECB published, on 5 January 1999, a consolidated opening financial statement of the Eurosystem, and subsequently, on 12 January, the first weekly financial statement, containing the assets and liabilities held by the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area vis-à-vis third parties. With a view to providing regular information, in particular on monetary policy operations and changes in foreign reserves, the ECB will continue to publish a weekly financial statement every Tuesday, accompanied by an explanatory note, in all official EU languages. As already indicated, the ECB will release the first edition of its Monthly Bulletin tomorrow. It will contain an assessment of the current economic situation underlying the ECB\\'s monetary policy decisions and also tables and charts covering a wide range of statistics relevant to monetary policy. In addition, the ECB will continue to release current monetary statistics on wire services. I should like to conclude by emphasising that these publications, together with the regular press conferences following the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and the numerous speeches given by the members of the Executive Board, demonstrate the importance which we attach to explaining the ECB\\'s monetary policy in a clear and transparent manner. I am now at your disposal to answer your questions.       Transcript of the Questions and Answers with the opening statement by the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Mrs. Randzio-Plath     This text is based on the English translation of the debate   Mrs Randzio-Plath (Chairperson of the Sub-Committee): Thank you very much colleagues. I would like to convene the first meeting of the Monetary Subcommittee in this very important year of 1999 when EMU has begun, and I would like to extend a very cordial welcome to the President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg. We are having this first monetary dialogue at point in time when the ECB enjoys exclusive decision-making powers in the area of monetary policy and is able to carry out these powers and this was established at the meeting of the Council of the European System of Central Banks. We are very impressed indeed with the introduction of the euro and its very smooth introduction to replace the national currencies. We have seen that the euro has been readily accepted not just in financial markets, not just in the EU but in all regions of the world and I, myself, would wish that certain childhood diseases, that we\\'re not going to talk about today, would in fact belong in past history in this era of the introduction of the euro. This is the first month, January, of EMU and we recognise that unfortunately fees are being charged for exchange operations, up to 4%. That\\'s from one EMU currency to another and that is not in the interests of our citizens. I, myself, exchanged 10 Deutsche Marks and received French francs back to the equivalent of 7 Deutsche Marks. Now these are things that our citizens will fail to understand. The euro age should surely not have these effects on our fellow citizens. They will find it difficult to follow and we must push the private sector, the banks and savings banks and I hope that they are going to improve this so that the euro is going to be readily accepted without any hiccups, certainly in the EU and the euro-11 area in a more natural way than perhaps it is at the moment. So may I invite you, President, to speak. We would like to progress together in this euro era and I understand that you have provided a preliminary copy of the first monthly bulletin of the European Central Bank to the Committee which was presented this morning in Frankfurt. That has been made available to all Members of the Subcommittee and you have the floor, Sir.        ***      Mrs Randzio-Plath: Thank you very much indeed, President, for those very clear words concerning monetary policy. You cover transparency, the need for work with the public and the move from the second to the third stage. Now, before I come onto questions I would like to welcome Mr van Velzen\\'s and Mr Goedbloed\\'s visitors groups and particularly my colleagues from National Parliaments, Mr Didden from Belgium and Mr Ahern from Ireland.   1. Questions relative to the changeover to the euro   Mr Metten: First of all may I start by saying that I had hoped that the monthly bulletin from the ECB would be available today because that would mean that we would have the figures in front of us. Mr Duisenberg says it is only going to be available tomorrow but we would have been able to put specific questions if we had these figures in front of us. However I would like to restrict myself to questions and the introduction of the euro in 2002. Now in 2002 we don\\'t want to have two legal tender currencies at the same time. Some member countries are thinking about a legal big bang. In other words there is only going to be the national legal tender up until 1st January 2002 and then there will be an overnight change. This means that we will have to teach the public how to deal with the euro without the euro actually being a method of payment. The euro will be a foreign currency that you change at a bank when you go abroad on holidays. Now on 7th January the Governing Council of the ECB said that, on the basis of Regulation 974, it would be impossible to have the euro in circulation at the same time as the national currencies before 2002. My question is the following, the text of the Regulation, which according to your text can be adjusted, is that the basis for your complaint or does it go deeper than this? The implication is that circulation of two legal tenders after 1st January 2002 should be possible if not necessary.   Mr Duisenberg: On the issue of frontloading it is our view that frontloading to the general public is the same as issuing or putting the money into circulation and it has been agreed to start the issuance of the euro banknotes and coins only on January 1st 2002. We are of the opinion that also in order to avoid confusion amongst the public, that frontloading to the general public is to be avoided not only on grounds of the decisions of the Council (articles 10 and 11), that have been published in May 1998 but also that it is undesirable for substantive reasons ; namely to avoid as much as possible confusion on which currency is in circulation. On the other hand we have full understanding for the desire of market operators, that is banks, shops, firms, retail organisations, to have the new currency already available some time before they can be put into circulation. Therefore we had also our decision of two weeks ago, which includes the statement that frontloading to banks, to retail organisations and other interested parties except the general public is permissible and possible provided that there are legal or contractual arrangements which prevent that frontloaded currency be made available to the general public in an indirect way.   Mr Metten: I understand that the first argument is the text of the Regulation. Mr Wellink said, we can\\'t change that. The second argument is one of confusion. Now the circulation of two legal tenders after 2002, is that not confusing? And a second point is, the status of the euro which will be frontloaded before 2002, is that not comparable with foreign currency where the consumer also knows, well I can\\'t yet pay with it, at least I can\\'t pay with that currency in the country where I have exchanged it but I can only use it in the country where it\\'s a legal tender?   Mr Duisenberg: I believe those two questions to be very similar indeed. The co-existence of two currencies during a certain period may also create confusion and so I have full understanding for every effort that is being made in many countries to let that period last as briefly as possible. We hope that the public already becomes so familiar with the euro in the meantime that we will be able to minimise that potential confusion, but totally avoid it, we cannot.   Mr Herman: Several governments have launched the idea of reducing the first phase from three to two years. Now what are the reasons why this is considered to be impossible?   Mr Duisenberg: I don\\'t say that it is impossible. I think that shortening that period by one full year is technically impossible. We need more time to produce the notes and in particular the coins, although as a Central Bank we have not much to do with that. We need more time than the limited time of two years which would only then be available or even less than two years. Given the fact that it is intended to put into circulation notes and coins simultaneously, one could imagine however, that for notes special measures would be taken to shorten the production period, but it would be a costly operation to do so. It would not be possible to shorten the period by more than just a few months, technically. It would, more politically, imply the requirement for many organisations to change their investment plans and their planning procedures which they now have made justifiably on the basis of the announcement that the introduction would be on 1st January 2002. In a way if we were now to shorten that period that could, although not legally, be interpreted as a breach of trust. There are organisations in various countries amongst which governments or local governments which have already announced that they need the full period up until 1st January 2002 in order to adjust all their systems, software applications etc.   Mr Langen: Yes, indeed President. In December Mr Kopper stated in Strasbourg that in technical terms it ought to be possible to reduce it by one or one and half years, down to eighteen months. What was at stake here was that the National Central Banks did not want to have the private sector producing banknotes and coins. Is that the opinion of a maverick banker? Or do you share that view?   Mr Duisenberg: Well the answer is that I don\\'t share that view. I have of course consulted technicians again ahead of this meeting also and asked them what would be possible and what would not be possible. One has to realise that the mass production of notes has not even begun. The production will start only in late February or early March and then orders have been placed to produce a quantity of 13 billion banknotes and it is envisaged that that process should be completed by 1st September 2001. Also the investment plans of the printing firms, of all the paper firms have been based on the fact that this process should be completed by 1st September 2001. Technically, it is my conviction, it simply is impossible to shorten that period by more than a couple of months. And then my question is what really are we talking about, if that is all that is possible. And the problem seems to be even larger where coins are concerned. There, the production and logistical efforts are far more complicated than in the case of banknotes. One also has to remember that the production of the euro coins has up until today started only in four of the eleven participating countries.   Mrs Peijs: Mr Duisenberg, you said that according to the May Regulation, it is not possible to distribute the Euro notes and coins four days in advance. You then say that for technical reasons the transition period cannot be reduced to one and half years but not under the Regulation. Now this implies that the Regulation can be changed if indeed that were to be the will of all those concerned in the European Union and I think that would be very useful indeed to get rid of people\\'s fears and worries about this transition, this change-over weekend. You were also talking about confusion. I would say that I am in favour of one national tender but if on 1st January 2002, if the public is expected to keep a currency separate, what about blind people\\'s organisations, shouldn\\'t they get the coins and notes four days beforehand so that they can get accustomed to this? And by way of conclusion, Mr Duisenberg, I would say that in the European Union we think that the best educated consumers in the world are being insulted if they will not be entrusted with keeping money for four days before they can actually use it.   Mr Duisenberg: Of course one can change a decision and revoke old ones but as I said is it worthwhile to do it for only four days or one week? I have serious doubts whether that would be wise. To my mind, it would also imply a not so stable and certain policy making process, as has been demonstrated by already publishing the decisions on when the currency would be introduced as early as May 1998 and by giving a clear indication to all concerned - that is Governments, the public, industry, services industries - that that would be the time that they had available to adjust all their systems. Then, to have it four days earlier than envisaged on 1st January, of course that would be technically possible, I don\\'t deny that, but I think it would be less than desirable. I ask myself what are the gains that you achieve by doing that and then by putting into circulation money around Christmas yime, that is the time when money in circulation reaches its peak of the year in all countries ; precisely at that moment then to introduce new notes and coins seems to me to be less than desirable.   Ms Torres Marques: What is your opinion on the irksome bank charges and excessive minimum charges that are made on exchange operations?   Mr Duisenberg: I have not yet full information of how it is across the European Union. Second, although I have no competence in the field to do something about it, I do with you deplore it if the rates that are being charged by financial organisations to make the change were proved to be excessively high. Then I would hope that at least market competition would lead to reduce unacceptably high charges as soon as possible.   2. Questions on monetary policy issues    Mr Hendrick: The Financial Times of 5th January stated \"several German Central Bankers said privately they might have cut interest rates earlier had it not been for political pressure\". This suggests the central bankers knowingly conducted the wrong policy to keep up an appearance of independence. Now although this happened before the European Central Bank started to operate monetary policy it might still point to a potential problem. The implication of this is that the banks knowingly delayed the interest cut. Could I ask Mr Duisenberg\\'s view on that. In particular as politicians cannot and should not be stopped from giving their views about monetary policy in public, will the ECB adopt a reasoned approach in this respect which means that if politicians are right at some stage to call for a cut or rise in the interest rate the ECB - provided they agreed on the need for a cut - would not delay the cut or dismiss it purely to provide the appearance of independence?   Mr Duisenberg: Well the question starts with an hypothesis, that something would be true which I simply can say is not. The decision on 3rd December to announce already the extraordinary decision of a coordinated cut in interest rates to a level of 3% from the then prevailing level in most countries of 3.3% and in some countries of even more than that was taken under circumstances when at the same time there was big political pressure to lower interest rates. Yet of course we have felt that pressure. We have noted it but it has not influenced us to do precisely that. Neither has it led to postpone it. On the contrary the decision to already on 3rd December announce a cut of interest rates and then on 22nd December to confirm that that interest rate would also be the interest rate with which we would enter stage three of monetary union, both were decisions which were contrary to what you suggest following the Financial Times were brought forward rather than anything else with a view to provide the market with as much certainty and a sense of continuity as we could. And those were decisions which were made in full independence, independent also of any pressure which might be exerted anywhere. Of course with you I regard it, as I have said publicly, as completely normal that politics or politicians sometimes will try to give a certain advice to the monetary authorities what to do, although in my experience I have seldom, if ever, received the advice to raise interest rates. Normally it goes in the other direction and that I regard as normal. Equally I regard it as normal for an independent Central Bank to come with its own judgement and ignore any advice given on political grounds.   Mr Hendrick: Given recent statistical indications, i.e. constant consumer prices and declining producer prices, does Mr Duisenberg not believe that the European economy has already entered a slight deflationary phase since at least June of last year, or at least come critically close to it? And given that the European economy will continue to experience the negative effects of the international financial crisis, is there not a danger that a more serious deflation is threatening us in the months to come which might not yet be recorded in the latest statistical data?   Mr Duisenberg: Well may I pretend or say that very careful analysis of all the available data does not suggest, as I indicated in my statement, that we have entered a deflationary phase as you call it. I did mention to you that the composition of the price increase figures that I mentioned for November contains a 2% increase in prices of services and only a 0.3% increase in the prices of goods. In addition it has to be remembered that some of the factors that have brought inflation down so much are by themselves of a temporary nature as we assume that for example the fall in energy prices which has greatly contributed to the lowering of the inflation levels is in itself of a temporary nature, at least it will not continue, it cannot continue at the rate at which it has. And then indications are, as I said, that it is not impossible that wage pressures may increase somewhat and we have taken that into account and we have seen that the impetus of the process of fiscal consolidation in the direction of the aims of the stability and growth pact clearly seems to have weakened in the course of the year 1998 and also as contained in the plans, as far as we know them, for the year 1999. So we see on balance no forces either for inflation to increase nor for inflation to diminish. Were we to see so, and I have said that we monitor developments very closely then of course we could come up with new decisions but for the future as far as we can foresee it now, the foreseeable future, we think that the level of interest rates we have chosen towards the end of 1998 is an appropriate one for the current economic situation.   Mr Hoppenstedt: Mr Duisenberg you said that economic growth estimated for the third quarter was not very optimistic for this year and you said that there are challenges in the reform of structures, in the labour market and the products market. And my question to you is can you just give advice on to how this should happen, or indeed are you also accompanying this with monetary policy measures?   Mr Duisenberg: I\\'m not quite sure that I understood the question precisely. We are living in a time of very great uncertainties about the global environment and the worsening economic climate globally, although in some areas of the world the economic climate already is improving again, I\\'m thinking of certain parts of Asia and the way it will have an impact on the euro area-wide economic developments. A few international institutions have recently revised downwards their estimates for growth in 1999. We have not, not even internally, done so yet but we are carefully monitoring the situation and, as I said, we regard, as far as monetary policy is concerned, the level at which the key rates have been set which imply markets interest rates which are lower than at any time since World War II, as appropriate for the time being, for the present economic situation.   Mr García-Margallo y Marfil: Thank you very much Mr President. I have a short question about the situation in Brazil. Can this have an impact on other areas such as Argentina and Chile? Secondly, from the internal point of view, one of the reasons which led to deciding on a central system but on a decentralised execution was to maintain a neutrality in the financial market place to avoid the dismantling of the markets and also concentration of operations in a limited number of market places. However, there is doubt over the concept and form of the national market places in the future. Has the European Central Bank decided to set up a monitoring system to assess how exchanges take place as well as the risks of geographical concentration of such operations? That is my question.   Mr Duisenberg: On Brazil, I can be very brief. In recent discussions with the Central Bankers of the countries mentioned by you, they proved to be very confident that any contagion effects of the Brazilian crisis on their economies, Argentina, Mexico, would be very limited indeed and that the effects could well be contained. So far market developments seem to prove them right. But of course the tumultuous events are of only a very recent nature so it may be too early to give a final judgement there. Now the second question, I honestly didn\\'t understand what the question was. The monitoring of the exchanges euro-wide is taking place both at the national level and at the central level. At the European Central Bank there is a lively exchange of information and providing of information to the European Central Bank by the National Central Banks on the monitoring of all the financial market places, which so far in the first two weeks of operation has proven to work out very satisfactorily.   Mr Donnelly: Well President can I also congratulate Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues for the very successful launch of the euro and I think it is a very good sign for the developments of the European Union. But I want to come back on the point that Mr Hendrick made because, with great respect to you Mr President, I think you were rather dismissive of the question. And the question is very clear that if you look at Japan you\\'ve had a movement in Japan in their economy down to zero inflation. You therefore have a liquidity trap where the citizens in Japan prefer to keep their assets in monetary reserves - in other words they collect savings - and as a result monetary policy is having no impact on the Japanese economy. Now I know that there is an argument about whether monetary policy has any role in the overall role of the management of the economy, but the fact is that if you look at the statistics, at the end of last year we are moving very close to zero in terms of inflation in France and Germany. Now I really don\\'t accept your answer. I think it\\'s rather dismissive of the Parliament just to say oh well if trends change then of course we\\'ll take appropriate action. Are you saying today to us absolutely there is no threat of the Japanese scenario occurring in the European Union in the euro-area? And if not, why can you not spell it out rather more clearly because of course if you look at the domestic output price index or the producer price index this has actually been continually declining since December 1997 and there is a serious worry. And can I just ask one other point, which I think is rather important. I look at the terms of reference of the Central Bank and we have a Governing Council that is meeting every two weeks and therefore the Governing Council of course is running the European Central Bank. Is the Executive Board fulfilling any other task other than acting as a secretariat to the Governing Council of the Central Bank?   Mr Duisenberg: I\\'ll take the last question first. The Executive Board of the European Central Bank : all six of them are individual members - with full voting rights - of the Governing Council. So, that part of the work, they do perform. Moreover, they coordinate all activities of the European System of Central Banks, the ECB and the NCBs of the participating Member States in a very active manner and thereby not only acting as secretaries but rather more often than not as the initiative takers. That\\'s not what you hear, but it\\'s what I do and very much we have the feeling that that is precisely what we are doing. On the second part, what has Japan achieved by following a monetary policy which has brought interest rates down with official interest rates to 0,25%? Further than that they cannot go, but the results for the real economy so far have demonstrably been very meagre indeed to say the least. We have an interest rate level, in a time when growth admittedly shows signs of coming down somewhat, of deceleration, but still the expectation is there will be growth, still the expectation is that the deceleration will be only temporary. In that context then to have interest rates at a level which is lower than at any time over the last 50 years seems to us to be an appropriate decision. You may compare these interest rates with those in Japan, I would also like to compare them with those in the United States, which seems to go through a similar phase of the economic cycle. We have interest rates at least 150 basis points lower than in the United States.   Mr Donnelly: Well you see that\\'s not really the question I put to you because as we know the Japanese started reducing their interest rates too late. They started reducing their interest rates as their economy slipped into recession and I\\'m asking you whether or not we run the same risk that you may take action, as you said earlier of course politicians always ask for interest rates cuts, but that we end up taking the action too late and therefore monetary policy has no impact which is what\\'s happened in Japan?   Mr Duisenberg: Yes, but then our analysis, and I can say it is shared by the Ministers of the Euro-11 group whose meeting, as indicated, I attended this morning, does not show or demonstrate or yield to the result that we are already moving into a recession. We are moving from a period where we had above average growth, above trend rate growth - think of the 3% during the first half of 1998 - into a period where growth will be somewhat slower. I define a recession as a continued period of more than a few quarters of no or negative growth. Then by no means are we moving in that direction according to our analysis.   Mr Porto: Before my questions I would like to come back to this point of my colleagues Hendrick and Donnelly. So you think that there is no deflation, but supposing that there is deflation, you said I took note, you would take new decisions. What kind of decisions would you take in the case there was deflation? And my main question, if I can, it\\'s about Brazil. There is a big discussion between the former Governor of the Bank of Brazil and the new Governor because the first one tried to have stable prices and with a very strong rate of exchange. Do you think the former Governor was right, or the present one, about decisions taken last week?   Mr Duisenberg: Well I don\\'t want to suppose that there were deflation because I don\\'t think there is deflation but taking the academic view point, if there were to be a further sustained deceleration of prices then a relaxation of monetary policy would be called for and we would take decisions accordingly without any doubt. On Brazil, really Mrs Chairman, I would prefer not to take sides with the previous or the current Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil.   Mr Giansily: President, with regard to the Chinese and Japanese operators how do you see their view on the euro and also on the ECB to manage the exchange rate with the dollar. Are you ready to answer certain requests linked to the fact that the Chinese might switch reserves of their Central Bank into euro to make it equivalent to their dollar reserves?   Mrs Randzio-Plath: This question we can also take for the subject number 4 if you don\\'t mind because we wanted now to discuss monetary polices. Monetary Policy?   Mr Wolf: I should also like to raise a question about deflation which has already been put here. First of all, as far as I know with the German price index, the price development has always been overestimated by about 0.8%. Has the ECB carried out investigations or plans to investigate the extent to which the Eurostat price index overestimates prices? I think that\\'s important, that was my first point. Secondly I would like to put a question and I think it is a question of monetary policy. Are you discussing, in the Euro-11, on matters of monetary policy and exchange rate policy?   Mr Duisenberg: The ECB closely follows the inflation figures, of course, but we cannot yet measure or make even an effort to measure this so-called measurement bias in inflation, because the series we have for our core rate of inflation, that is the harmonised index of consumer prices, only has a very recent history. We simply don\\'t have the data for a sufficiently long period of time to make an acceptable effort to measure the potential measurement bias. We think there is one as there is one in every inflation index all over the world, in Germany, in the United States, in the United Kingdom, everywhere but we are not sure yet what it would be in the euro area and because of that uncertainty that is also the main reason why when publishing our definition of price stability we have published an upper bound but not made very precise or explicit a lower bound. We have said we measure price stability by a rate of increase, thereby giving a bias in the positive direction, by a rate of increase over the medium term of below 2%. As I also have indicated in various public statements and in answers to questions, also here in this Parliament, you can be sure that we dislike deflation as much as we dislike inflation so implicitely there is a lower limit but we cannot yet measure or even try to measure the potential measurement bias that is contained in these figures. Now in the Euro-11 meetings, the debate in which I participate on the current economic situation covers all aspects of economic developments including monetary developments but also fiscal developments and well it is only understandable that in the dialogue which is developing in the Euro-11 I have the inclination to talk a little bit more about fiscal developments than most Ministers do and Ministers have the inclination to talk a little bit more about monetary developments than the President of the Central Bank does.   Mr Wolf: First of all if it is uncertain then shouldn\\'t we start thinking how a preventive policy could be carried out against inflation because that may come about and secondly the question on exchange rate policy in the Euro-11 was mentioned but you didn\\'t take up that point.   Mr Duisenberg: We are following a preventive policy by pursuing a policy which is aiming at price stability over the medium term and it is a forward looking policy so in that way it is preventive but we think that by setting the interest rates at an historically low level for the foreseeable future, and I cannot specify how long we can foresee that future, we give as much certainty and a feeling of continuity and stability to the markets as we can. We think this is most conducive to the growth of income and employment, but it is preventive in the sense of a forward looking policy formulation. Exchange rate policy has not been discussed if that answers your question.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: Thank you very much Mr Duisenberg. I would like to come back again to the question of deflation. There is a kind of asymmetry between the competence of acting in the ECB in questions of inflation and deflation and how do you interprete in the ECB Article 105. I still fail to understand when the time is that the ECB must act in order to support employment. If it is clear from the stability programmes that the Governments of the Member States respect at this stage the stability pact and on the other hand the trade unions are carrying out very cautious wage policy, do you already at this stage have a clearer opinion, a clearer position especially in view of the father of the euro that the euro could be too strong rather than too weak?   Mr Duisenberg: I don\\'t see an asymmetry in the competences of the European Central Bank to take decisions and as far as Article 105 is concerned the European Central Bank shall contribute to the general goals of the European Community in terms of promoting growth and employment as far as the primary aim of price stability is not being endangered. But then it is our strong belief that the best contribution that monetary policy can make precisely to that end, is to create and maintain a climate of price stability. As I indicated in my introductory statement to the extent that that climate then contributes to the lowest possible risk premium which is contained in the long-term interest rate and in inflationary expectations that is to our mind the best contribution that monetary policy in those circumstances can make. I would warn against the reasoning that now that we have achieved price stability with a certain level of interest rates, we should change track and focus on other things, in the interest of economic policy in general. Our aim isnot only to have price stability but also to maintain it. That is explicitly in our mandate.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: But if we have an inflation rate tending towards zero and if you look at the real interest rates then don\\'t you think that for economic growth, investment it is the real interest rate in the EU which is still too high, the real interest rates?   Mr Duisenberg: Well the real interest rates as I said are lower than they have been for a very long time and I want to point to the fact that as I also already earlier said they have come down over the past year by about 100 basis points so that development has already by itself had the beneficial effect of contributing to a resumption of growth and employment.   Mr Lindqvist: Thank you Madame President. The introduction seems to have been relatively successful as you said. Electronics and data and technics have functioned well. But when there will come crisis, with economic, regional differences, increased unemployment, winners or losers about the euro, what readiness do you have for real life? Meaning is it the stability and growth pact which is the readiness you have or will it be the direction of changes in the meaning of more of finance and tax harmonisation in line with the proposal from the German Finance Minister? That\\'s my question. Thank you.   Mr Duisenberg: Well the assumption is if a crisis develops here or there in the monetary union what will the policy reaction of the ECB be? Well the answer is that we always have to take a euro area-wide perspective and that regional differences in the developments we have to more or less overlook but it is only euro area-wide considerations that will induce us to take certain policy measures which differ from the measures that already have been taken.   Mr Lindqvist: You said that you are not going to take account of regional differences within the framework of difficulties with unemployment for example? Did I hear you right?   Mr Duisenberg: Our policy has a euro area-wide perspective and cannot, and will not, be based on diverging developments in the region, just the same as there always used to be one monetary policy also in countries which had very diverging regional developments - in Germany, in Italy, in the Netherlands -, and everywhere, always, one monetary policy not taking into account the interests or developments in one particular region. Regional monetary policy as I have often said does not exist.   Mr Burenstam Linder: I have a question concerning transition. Transition of the pre-ins, take my own country where the Social Democratic Party at long last has decided to go for the referendum and to secure a yes for Sweden to join the monetary union, this referendum if held as planned in the autumn of year 2000, how long would it practically take before a country could then join?   Mr Duisenberg: The easiest thing is to say 2 years but that is a highly political question which requires a highly political answer and the ECB itself is not the one that will be asked to give that answer. It will be the Governments of the European Union and of the Monetary Union in particular who will answer that question but practically now as an economist I would think that a country aspiring to become a full member of monetary union would have to demonstrate that it in practice is able to meet the same convergence criteria as those which have been applied to the countries in the first wave.   Mr Katiforis: Mr President, in a large part of the professional press you see that in the stock exchanges throughout the world at the moment and particularly on Wall Street there is a \\'bubble\\' situation and your colleague from the Federal Reserve in the United States is cultivating in a very reasonable way this view which could be considered legitimate in the rest of the world. But the problem is that \\'bubbles\\' can burst at any time with the results that we\\'re familiar with. Is this a problem which you have thought about, and as the rates influence each other, is this a consideration for the interest rate of the ECB?   Mr Duisenberg: The question pertains to the increase in asset prices which has taken place and is taking place. We follow that carefully, we monitor it carefully and we have come to the conclusion that for the time being this is not developing into a bubble which could burst suddenly or unexpectedly. So it has been considered just as it is being considered in the United States and there they have come to the same conclusion but as I have not heard Mr Greenspan repeat the words he said in 1987 of an \\'irrational exuberance\\' prevailing in markets. He has been very careful to avoid expressions in that direction and rightly so, I think.   Mr Katiforis: I wouldn\\'t expect him to say such things in the present situation, would you?   Mr Duisenberg: No, that\\'s right.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: Yes that\\'s clear. Well colleagues we move onto the third series of issues. Democratic accountability, transparency of the decisions taken by the ECB.   3. Democratic accountability and transparency of decisions of the ECB.   Mr Ettl: As regards democratic accountability and particularly transparency, we have tried to have clear definitions in real policy terms. This means that monetary policy should not stand, and cannot stand, outside an economic and social policy and it tends to be focused on the economic policy side. Therefore what you said about foreign exchange mechanisms didn\\'t gladden my heart. However that\\'s part and parcel of the economic framework and I think that the ECB should use all possible margins for stability and growth and we need to have transparency, accountability of the ECB, that is quite clear. Now pursuing the goal of price stability is obviously at stake, but you are looking at the domestic market and at the issue of employment, I have a question that springs to mind. What do you see as the ECB contribution towards the European Parliament and also to European socio and economic partnership? What is the Bank\\'s contribution to that, the partners who you need in order to translate your policies into reality? I would like to see how you envisage this fitting together practically. Thank you.   Mr Duisenberg: I must say, I know of no central bank in the world which has such intensive contacts with the Parliament of the region it represents as the ECB, which goes to such lengths to publish immediately and explain immediately all decisions that are being taken. I must confess, I look at our own website every day and there are days that I am surprised that so many things have again been decided and published and explored widely. The ECB not only has in terms of democratic accountability and transparency to my mind extremely intensive contacts with the European Parliament, but also with the public at large, also with governments and also, and that\\'s the second part of your question, we are actively engaging in developing a dialogue with the social partners. But it is very difficult to organize and to structure, with social partners coming from 11 participating countries, to develop a useful dialogue, but we have started that and we will continue to have that dialogue with the partners, we are open to that.   Mr Paasilinna: Even the economic and monetary experts have noticed that the press communications of the European Central Bank are very difficult to understand. They are cryptic in nature. This has become evident when we have just in this same room discussed the inflationary targets and then compared that to the Bank\\'s bulletin in October containing completely contradictory information. Now that you mention the monthly bulletin, or information leaflet, can you improve it so as to contain a simplified section in it as well, because there is great interest in it and there are lots of leaks to that effect as well? Could you also publish the results of the meetings of the Governing Council?   Mr Duisenberg: Well, I don\\'t know whether we can simplify the language. We are doing our utmost to make ourselves understood as best as we can and as quickly as we can. I do want to point out that it has already been decided and announced that there will be a press conference which is widely attended after every other meeting of the Governing Council, publishing and explaining all decisions and discussions that have taken place in the Governing Council on that day, and we do that in a very coordinated way and to make ourselves understood as best as we can. I am sorry to hear that, apparently, we still use too difficult language, but then I am reminded of a statement by Mr Greenspan who once said \"if I understand that you have understood what I said, I must have chosen the wrong words\", but that\\'s not what we intend. We want to be understood and we want to explain as explicitly as we can our decisions, in the monthly bulletin which you will have a chance to read carefully as from tomorrow, and we will repeat that, of course, every month. Weekly, we publish a financial statement, let\\'s say a balance sheet, of the consolidated central banking system of Europe, together with explanatory notes. Admittedly, these explanatory notes are normally understood, as is the case in national central banks also, mainly only by the experts.   Mr Porto: There was a criticism by my colleague Mr Donnelly that the board meets every fortnight. If I can appreciate this from the view point of my country, I think this is good for the euro because people feel that their central bank is involved in the euro. So what is seen by some as a criticism, I think is a positive element. Besides the role you have is not the one of a secretariat.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: If I may put my question. Do you think there will be new thinking in the ECB concerning the publication of the minutes ; may this 16 year period be subject to review in order to move closer towards the transparency as in the German Bundesbank? There has been a broad discussion about greater transparency, and perhaps that might encourage you to achieve progress in that area in terms of democratic accountability.   Mr Duisenberg: Well, the answer I have given already many times, and that answer is no Madame Chair.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: Well that\\'s a question I\\'m going to have to keep on putting until I have a different answer I think. I can assure you that this Parliament is optimistic that there will indeed be a positive change. So, we now move on to the international dimension of the euro.   4. International dimension of the euro   Mr Stevens: Thank you Madame Chair. Two questions. The first is, I quite understand why you don\\'t want to talk about target zones for currencies at all, vis-à-vis the dollar or the yen. Nevertheless, the fact that there are problems over the statistics, that you have on inflation and indeed the statistics you have on money supply - we were talking about the problems of the inflation statistics before - there is a view around in international markets that because you do not have real guidance on your inflation and your money supply statistics, you are going to be de facto forced into some form of exchange rate policy. I was just wondering whether you would comment on that. My second question is, what about the future shape of international monetary cooperation? Do you feel basically that it is inevitable that we are going to be getting rid of G-7 and that there will be a block of three running the world monetary system - dollar, yen and euro?   Mr Duisenberg: I am almost inclined to say that the statistics, both on money supply and inflation, are improving every day and by no means are we forced, through qualitative insufficiency in the statistics, forced in the direction of an exchange rate target. The Treaty is clear in giving its mandate to the ECB, that is to maintain price stability, and that means internal price stability. The exchange rate, vis-à-vis the other big blocks in the world, let\\'s give the animal a name, the dollar and the yen, is the outcome rather than a target of monetary policy and of the economic policies of the various blocks.What we are very much in favour of, is not so much target zones, but as stable a relationship as we can achieve. But our primary goal is and remains internal price stability, so there is no forcing us in another direction. On the institutional side, the ECB, of course, still has to find its place in the various international fora. There are formal and informal fora. There is the G-7, which is an informal forum, there is the IMF which is a formal forum, where we have the complication that the IMF only has sovereign states as its members and the ECB is not such a sovereign state. Still, we have reached agreement with the IMF, and I am extremely grateful for that, that the ECB will be invited to appoint a permanent representative on the executive board of the IMF. So we will be there and we will be able to make our voice heard on matters which are of crucial interest to the ECB. In the G-7, which is an informal gathering, on the agenda of the G-7 meetings, there are of course many points other than monetary policy and it is only on monetary policy where Europe is united and speaks and has to speak with one voice. Therefore, in those parts of the G-7 meetings which deal with matters of relevance for monetary policy, the ECB is already being invited to represent the European monetary system\\'s views, so there we have come, to my mind at least, to a highly acceptable and satisfactory arrangement. How future developments will go, once again I say the G-7 deals with many more problems than monetary policy alone, and I cannot predict how Europe will further represent itself.   Mr Pérez Royo: President, would you allow me to stress this particular point of the international dimension of the euro, particularly the possible setting-up of exchange rate target zones. We are fully aware of your position, generally the position of central bankers. We are also aware of the position of a number of prominent politicians. Some of them, and in particular Oscar Lafontaine has qualified his initial position, but at any rate public opinion perceives a difference in focus on this problem between the politicians and those responsible for the central banks, and I would like to remind you that the Treaty guarantees to the Central Bank independence of monetary policy, but it falls to the Council to deal with exchange rates, I believe. Now you said that in the Euro-11, that subject has never been discussed. I take it that it cannot be excluded that this matter might arise there in the near future in the Euro-11, or in the ECOFIN Council, they may well seek to discuss this issue of exchange rates. So, I would like to know what your reaction would be and what remarks you would care to make at the moment as to that possibility?   Mr Duisenberg: I am also fully convinced that that matter will come up in one of the future meetings of either the ECOFIN or the Euro-11 getting together. On exchange rate targets, it has to remain clear that first of all I want to say exchange rates are the competence indeed, as you indicated, of Governments and not of the central banks, yet an exchange rate policy in practice has to be carried out mainly by the central banks. But also other areas of economic policy would have to contribute to fulfilling the \"targets\", if and how they were to be set, and the European System of Central Banks would be willing to contribute to such \"targets\" only to the extent that they would not endanger its primary aim, that is the aim of achieving internal price stability and that might very well happen. Suppose that Europe were in a recession and that in that recession the exchange rate, vis-à-vis the dollar, would drop, would depreciate. Then the exchange rate policy could require the European System of Central Banks to increase interest rates which would come at a very painful moment if it were in that phase of the conjunctural cycle. So it is not all benefits that can be expected. The general attitude towards \"targets\" is that the world is nowadays a little bit different from what it was 14 years ago when Louvre and Plaza agreements were put in place. Capital markets have been liberalized and developed tremendously. You can be certain that if ever you announce a certain target, which you have to do multilaterally, also with the other parties involved, of course, you can be certain that there will always come moments when markets will test the limits or the ability of the authorities to defend the exchange rate against the limits which are being reached. And it is very doubtful whether that defence at that time would be in the interest of the primary goal that the Central Bank has to achieve. So there are grave doubts. May I once again quote my colleague on the other side of the Atlantic when asked the same question in a recent public appearance he made. When asked this question, his answer was very brief and very simple and that was \"target zones have to be regarded as in the modern world neither feasible nor desirable\".   Mr Pérez-Royo: I much appreciate the pragmatism of your answer, but taking into account your last comment, I have a more specific question to put to you. You said that the ECB will not follow a benign neglect policy, but this will be done by the people on the other side of the Atlantic, and you also said that you will not follow a policy of explicit objectives with regard to exchange rates. Could you explain a little more what the terms of this policy would be with regard to exchange rates? Which you would recommend?   Mr Duisenberg: The monetary policy strategy, as I outlined it earlier, the second pillar I mentioned, is that it would be based on a broadly based assessment of all the main economic indicators which have an impact on price stability. Well one of these indicators, of course, and it could be a very prominent one, is the development of the exchange rate vis-à-vis other major currencies. So, it would be regarded as an indicator, although the exchange rate itself would be the result of policies rather than the target of policies. As an indicator it could also trigger certain policy actions at certain times, namely to the extent that the development of this indicator would in itself endanger the achievement of the goal of internal price stability, so there will be no neglect, neither benign nor malign.   Mr Giansily: It is indeed difficult today to measure the stability of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar, although since the beginning of January we have enjoyed quite stable parities from one day to the other, but at the end of 1998 the Chinese and Japanese especially, expressed from the central bank, said that they wanted to introduce the euro in their reserves in quite large numbers, to be equivalent to their dollar reserves with a view to balancing their reserves for a currency which they believe dominates the others more. I\\'d like to know what your position is Mr President on this request, because it may be a massive request in months to come?   Mr Duisenberg: The ECB takes a neutral stance on this question. It will neither encourage nor discourage foreign reserve holders of moving into the euro as their reserve currency, because we believe that if they want to do it we cannot do anything against it anyway, so we will have to accept it. We will cross that bridge when we come to it and we see it happening. I do not expect, looking at history, that it will be a sudden and unexpected process. The only thing I talked about with my Japanese and Chinese colleagues is that if ever they do it, and I don\\'t ask them to do it, but if ever they decide they want to diversify their reserve holdings, let us be in close touch when you do it, so as to avoid any disturbance in markets which might arise if it is done in an unexpected or too quick way. And it is of course also in their own interest to do it in a very responsible way, so we\\'ll be in touch maybe some time.   Mrs Thyssen: I\\'d like to come back to the very first question which Mr Metten put. If I\\'ve correctly understood things, then Mr Duisenberg said that there are legal reasons for not having frontloading to the public at large and that in addition to the legal reasons there are really just reasons along the lines of, well it could lead to confusion. Now, if we in the European Parliament were to take a majority decision as representatives of the people, and we say that the only confusion that can arise from frontloading is less than the confusion which would arise in the dual system at the beginning of 2002, if we were to draw that conclusion, could we count on your support vis-à-vis the European Commission, or have we to leave everything as it is in the present Regulation concerning the introduction of the actual notes? I got the impression that it is a political decision rather than monetary arguments which justify that.   Mr Duisenberg: If frontloading to the general public at a date earlier than the moment of circulation were to be the recommendation of the European Parliament, I would disagree and I think the ECB would not follow that recommendation. If it were to be to change the Council decision that has been taken, that\\'s up to the Council to decide. It\\'s the Council of Ministers which took and published those decisions. That would be up to the Ministers. My personal inclination would be to discourage the Ministers, I say in all frankness, to change their decision, but rather to maintain the position of certainty and predictability which has been achieved so far. But that\\'s my personal declaration. On this aspect, I cannot yet speak for the ECB as a whole. I would have to discuss that in the ECB Governing Council before I make it an ESCB recommendation.   Mr Fourçans: I have a technical question. I hope you don\\'t mind me putting it. I want to understand better how the monetary policy will be implemented and I also think it is important for the euro-zone banking system. When the ECB decides on its refinancing policy, I suppose it decides a package for the banking system, and how is this package distributed between the various national central banks? Is there a quota, does it depend on the GDP, how is it done? Specifically, how is the monetary policy specifically implemented?   Mr Duisenberg: Well, for example, but I\\'m not a technical expert either, weekly there is a decision on the next short-term financing facility, the REPOS. To that end, the Executive Board which takes those decisions, and it does not act as a secretariat but it actually takes the decisions every week, meets every Tuesday at 10.55 a.m. so that the decision is taken and made public at 11.00 a.m. Then it is distributed over the countries according to the bids that have come in from all the various national banking systems, private banking systems. Only part of the bids, in one case 15% in another case below 10%, are actually granted and allotted, but how precisely the key of dividing it is determined, I must honestly say that - I\\'ll ask Mr Hoogduin if he knows this - but I don\\'t.   Mr Hoogduin: Well, it\\'s just as explained. Every bank is allowed to bid on the main refinancing facility and then we aggregate all the bids that have come in and we know the amount that we want to allot. That determines the percentage of the bid that is granted to every bank. So it\\'s not based on the GDP share, but on the bids that are received from the banks. The banks themselves can bid, we add all the bids together, look at the amount to be allotted and determine the share that every bank receives. Every bank receives the same share of its bid.   Mrs Berès: You said, President, that the euro-zone doesn\\'t risk deflation at present, but what about the employment situation? In your presentation you said that the question of employment was to be tackled through reform of the employment market. More and more people believe that without real growth there will be no improvement in employment. So my question is, how do you think that monetary policy can and should contribute towards such growth, and to what extent can it help growth? We know that employment is built up through growth and risk capital.   Mr Duisenberg: Let me repeat what I have said earlier, that in our view the best contribution that monetary policy can deliver to promote growth of ouput and employment, is to create a stable environment in terms of a stable price environment and also that the expectations of future price developments are as low as possible and are as credible as possible, by delivering the low price increases environment, which in turn leads to eliminating, to the maximum extent possible, the risk premia that are included in particular in long-term interest rates. I think we have delivered that promise already to a great extent. However, the simple fact that in 1997 and the first half of 1998, on a euro area-wide basis, the rate of growth of GDP was in excess of the trend rate of growth of GDP in the euro area and yet there was hardly any decline, or only a very gradual decline in the rate of unemployment in the euro area, underpins the statement that the unemployment problem as we are facing it now is not caused by cyclical factors, but that it is, to the largest extent possible, of a structural nature. Therefore, in order to cure it, it requires measures of a structural nature like making labour markets and product markets more flexible. And measures have to be taken in that context, and we don\\'t believe, given this economic development as we have seen it over the past year, that you can spend your way out of the unemployment problem.   Mr Herman: On the external impact of the euro, what is the role Europe has taken in the recent arrangements with the IMF and the Brazilian authorities in granting a 40 billion dollar loan?   Mr Duisenberg: I have been kept continuously informed. The package was, of course, designed at a time when the ECB itself was not yet operational. It is a complex package including the IMF, the BIS, the national governments who used the help of their national central banks in that situation. We have been continuously kept informed in our role of, already then, increasingly becoming the coordinator of all the national central banks policies, but that was about it.   Mrs Randzio-Plath: Well thank you very much indeed for this first dialogue in this new euro era. I think that we will have food for thought. You have quoted Mr Greenspan on five occasions. I wonder if you are going to be quoted in his speeches in the US as the equivalent authority, and certainly I would like to thank you, and I\\'m speaking for everyone here. I would also like to thank your team and the new staff members who are starting at the ECB this year and wish you every success. I am sure we all want to see things going as smoothly as possible this year to achieve the stabilisation of the euro and a balanced internal and external value for the euro. You are pursuing your monetary policy we realise, but all of us are supporting the aims of the Maastricht Treaty and also monetary policy is part and parcel of that. We also have to see whether this year it is going to be possible to get a greater coordination of economic policies by member governments and we will observe with very great interest the dialogue that you have with representatives of governments in the Euro-11 as well as in ECOFIN, but rest assured that we will continue to push for transparency of monetary policy decisions. We will be able to follow your press conferences but, of course, we will also count on further dialogues with you. Thank you very much indeed.   ']\n",
      "['1999-01-15', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'European economic and monetary union - latest developments', \"Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Central Bank <br>at the Second Asia-Europe Finance Ministers' Meeting on 15 January 1999, <br>Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\", '  European economic and monetary union - latest developments   Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Central Bank at the Second Asia-Europe Finance Ministers\\' Meeting on 15 January 1999, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Central Bank (ECB), at a time when the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the 11 national central banks (NCBs) of the Member States which have adopted the euro - has just started to assume responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area. After their meeting in 1997 in Bangkok, this is the second time that Asian and European Finance Ministers are coming together with the aim of establishing closer political, economic and financial links between Europe and Asia. I very much appreciate this approach, since the process of rapid globalisation, with highly integrated financial markets, calls for strengthened co-operation between the two regions. Today, I should like to share some thoughts with you on recent developments surrounding the introduction of the euro. First of all, I should like to comment on the successful changeover to the euro only two weeks ago and its rapid acceptance by financial markets. Second, I shall focus on how we intend to accomplish our primary task of maintaining price stability across the euro area in an internationally challenging environment. Finally, I shall turn to the international aspect of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).      The successful changeover to the euro    Following a period of intense preparatory work and considerable progress in macroeconomic convergence, the third and final stage of EMU started on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the euro. The 11 Member States initially participating in the euro area have transferred their monetary policy sovereignty to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Since 1 January 1999 the Eurosystem has been responsible for determining monetary policy for the entire euro area, which has an overall population of almost 300 million people and a GDP which is roughly equal to that of the United States. The start of the euro has been successful. Such a smooth launch of the new currency was not widely expected until the very end of 1998. In the early afternoon of 31 December 1998, the Council of the European Union adopted the irrevocable conversion rates of the euro against the participating currencies. During the following three and a half days, over the so-called changeover weekend, all technical work required to create a single integrated euro area money market was implemented without any major incidents. Under very severe time constraints, the banking and financial community in the euro area and beyond, including the ECB and the national central banks, carried out the complex task of converting billions of electronic records and managing a variety of other logistical challenges. Large-value payment systems were adjusted to function in the new currency and the bulk of the outstanding public debt of participating countries was redenominated before the first trading day in euro started on 4 January 1999. The Eurosystem played a crucial role in this process. It was involved in a very large number of activities, including helping to compute and publish the irrevocable conversion rates. The ECB co-ordinated the orderly transition to the new currency within the Eurosystem. It conducted final tests, when required, and it launched the new infrastructure for payments and securities settlement. For this purpose, a \"Changeover Weekend Committee\" and a network of \"central communication points\" were created to gather and share information. Contacts were established with the central banks of non-participating EU Member States and of the Concertation Group - including the Bank of Japan - as well as the European Commission. The decision-making bodies of the ESCB stood ready to gather in extraordinary teleconference meetings, if necessary. As regards monetary policy operations, the Eurosytem announced its first main refinancing operation in the form of a fixed rate tender in the amount of E75 billion on 4 January, which was completed successfully on the following day. In the context of this operation, 944 Monetary Financial Institutions bid and, since a fixed rate tender procedure was applied, every institute was allotted a refinancing amount.  In addition, the Eurosystem began successfully operating the euro area payment system, TARGET, which ensures the smooth settlement of cross-border payments in the euro area and, as such, has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market. After some \"teething troubles\", the financial community in the euro area is adapting to the system and the new euro environment. More than 5,000 credit institutions are currently participating directly in TARGET. The very rapid acceptance of the new currency by financial market participants in the first two trading weeks following its introduction has further contributed to the credibility of the Eurosystem. Such credibility, which already existed prior to the introduction of the euro, helps to explain why the euro area weathered the financial market turmoil relatively well in the second half of 1998. Propitious starting conditions within the euro area facilitated the task of the Eurosystem. In most of 1998 and at the beginning of 1999, the overall price climate has been very favourable, with neither risks of inflation nor signs of deflation. In addition, long-term interest rates have fallen to new historical lows and the whole yield curve has shifted downward.      The single monetary policy in a challenging environment        Institutional framework    Of course, this favourable environment is facilitating our task of maintaining price stability across the euro area. Price stability is at the heart of the \"stability culture\" that has developed in Europe in the period leading to the adoption of the euro. This culture is not to be seen as an objective in itself but as a major prerequisite for sustainable growth and improved employment prospects in Europe. To meet the objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area in an effective and credible way, the Treaty establishing the European Community has endowed the Eurosystem with a high degree of independence. The counterpart of such independence is accountability and transparency vis-à-vis the European Parliament and the public at large. In terms of its institutional framework, the ESCB is based on the concept of a dual-layer central bank system consisting of the ECB and the 15 NCBs of the EU Member States. As regards the Eurosystem, its highest decision-making body is the Governing Council of the ECB, which meets every fortnight. It is composed of the six Executive Board members of the ECB and the Governors of the 11 participating NCBs. In addition, the General Council, comprising the members of the Governing Council and the Governors of all the national central banks in the European Union, including the four EU central banks not yet participating in the euro area, meets quarterly. By virtue of their involvement in the General Council, the four non-participating national central banks are associated with the relevant ESCB decisions, such as those relating to the new exchange rate mechanism ERM II. With regard to accountability and transparency, the Eurosystem goes beyond the requirements of the Treaty. In addition to my yearly appearance before the European Parliament to present the ECB\\'s Annual Report, I shall take part in hearings at the European Parliament four times a year. Since summer 1998, a routine of holding monthly press conferences has been established, in which the Vice-President and I report on the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and explain the underlying reasoning. Our introductory statements at these press conferences are published without delay. In addition, the ECB will provide the public with a Monthly Bulletin, the first issue of which will be published next week.      Monetary policy strategy    Let me now describe how we intend to meet our mandate to maintain price stability at the start of Stage Three of EMU. At the heart of our approach is our recently adopted and publicly announced \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\". Since the introduction of the euro implies a regime shift, the formulation of an appropriate monetary policy strategy was a complex exercise. Breaks in previously established economic relationships are bound to make our interpretation of euro area-wide data more difficult in the initial phase of Stage Three. The length of this transition period itself is difficult to ascertain. Economic agents may restructure their investment portfolios and adjust their expectations. The wage formation process may change and entrepreneurs could alter their traditional price-setting behaviour. Bearing this in mind, the Governing Council invested considerable effort in the design of a coherent framework, taking into account the specific circumstances of the shift to the new monetary regime. Let me briefly recall the main features of our monetary policy strategy. First of all, we have defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%, which is to be maintained over the medium term. This definition constitutes a clear benchmark against which the public can properly assess the success of the Eurosystem in fulfilling the Treaty\\'s mandate of price stability. It shows that the Eurosystem pursues a symmetric approach to deal with both inflation and deflation, and that the single monetary policy cannot, and should not, react to specific national developments. In order to maintain price stability according to this definition, the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy strategy is based on two pillars. First, money is assigned a prominent role, since monetary developments are the determinants of inflation in the medium to long term. Therefore, we have announced a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3, in 1999. On the basis of our current economic forecasts, a growth rate of 4.5% has been set, which is consistent with price stability. However, the fact that it is a reference value and not a monetary policy target implies that monetary policy will not react in a mechanistic way to short-term deviations from this level. Second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and of potential risks to price stability in the euro area also plays a major role. This is achieved by making use of a wide range of monetary, financial and economic indicators in the preparation of our monetary policy decisions.      Monetary policy operational framework    On the operational side of monetary policy, the ECB has recently set interest rates for the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy instruments. Consistent with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two of EMU, after the remarkable co-ordinated interest rate cuts carried out by euro area NCBs in early December last year, the benchmark level for the first main refinancing operation was set at 3%. We announced our intention to maintain this interest rate level for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Eurosystem uses standing facilities, namely the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility, to absorb and provide overnight liquidity respectively. The deposit rate has been set at 2% and the marginal lending rate at 4.5%. However, as a transitional measure aimed at smoothing the adaptation of market participants during the initial days of Stage Three of EMU, the corridor established by the interest rates for the Eurosystem\\'s standing facilities has been kept narrow, with the deposit rate at 2.75% and the lending rate at 3.25%. Since such a narrow corridor hampers the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market, we intend to terminate it next week, in accordance with our pre-announced schedule.      Economic policy co-operation    The ESCB does not operate in a vacuum. If not adequately supported by other policy areas, namely fiscal, labour and structural policies, implemented mainly at the national level, the single monetary policy may become overburdened. Monetary policy needs to be supplemented by appropriate fiscal, labour and structural policies if it is to yield in full its welfare benefits to the euro area. This is a major prerequisite to improve the perspectives for sustainable economic growth and for tackling the unemployment problem. That is why I attach the utmost importance to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact. In this Pact, euro area Member States agreed to reduce their general government deficits to close to balance or even to create a surplus in the medium term. This is intended to enable the working of automatic stabilisers over the economic cycle while, simultaneously, respecting the limit of 3% on the public deficit/GDP ratio, as laid down in the Treaty. As regards labour and structural policies, the single monetary policy cannot solve Europe\\'s unemployment problem by itself. Of course, a stability-oriented monetary policy can help to stabilise inflationary expectations and, thereby, hold interest rates at levels consistent with the highest possible non-inflationary growth rate. However, since Europe\\'s unemployment problem is largely structural in origin, only structural reforms improving the flexibility of labour markets and supportive wage policies can provide the appropriate policy response.       The international side of EMU    Let me now try to shed some light on the international aspect of EMU. Clearly, the newly designed monetary setting in Europe will have far-reaching implications not only for Europe and its citizens, but also for the world economy and the international community. Although, the introduction of the euro represents a major institutional change in the architecture of the international monetary system, it does not in itself imply a regime shift from the present managed floating exchange rate system.     International aspect of the euro    A number of observers consider that one important motivation behind EMU is the creation of a major international role for the euro. This assessment is largely incorrect. The ECB takes a neutral stance with respect to the international role of the euro. First of all, the euro represents a major contribution to the completion of a fully integrated single market, encouraging competition and innovation at the area-wide level, in an environment of prices which remain stable over time. The international role of a currency is a complex phenomenon. A currency can be used for different functions, as an anchor and reserve currency on the official side, and, on the private side, as an invoicing and vehicle currency for international trade, as well as a currency of denomination for financial assets. In addition, there are very different groups of economic agents which decide on the use of the currency, including governments, central banks, institutional and private investors, corporations and traders. At any rate, it will take time for the euro to develop its role as an international currency in its various functions. In principle, two basic factors will determine the future international dimension of the euro - risk and size. Economic agents may use the euro to hedge their risks through portfolio diversification. If international investors and borrowers consider that the euro will become a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimise risk in their internationally diversified portfolios. With regard to the size factor, a broad and liquid euro financial market may lead to a widespread use of the euro, which, in turn, would facilitate its development as a vehicle currency for trade and commodity pricing. The euro is likely to develop over time as an international currency used by the private sector, although the pace of internationalisation may vary depending on the function. As far as the future share of the euro in overall official reserves is concerned, it may be expected that central banks of non-euro area countries will also reassess their reserve management strategy in the light of improved global diversification opportunities offered by the new currency. Moreover, the euro might also assume a greater role as an anchor currency for other European countries which, formally or informally, intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a (trade-weighted) basket of currencies which includes the euro as a large component. In this context, the euro may increasingly become part of foreign currency reserves held by central banks for diversification or pegging purposes.      International representation of the Eurosystem    Let me turn to the institutional aspect. The euro area is a new counterpart in the context of international co-operation. By reducing the number of key players, the euro will simplify the international policy co-operation process between the major economies. In particular, it should make this process more efficient by facilitating the exchange of views and formulation of common understandings on economic and financial issues at the global level. Each of the main partners - the United States, the euro area and Japan - is in a position to speak for a comparatively large economic area and is similarly vulnerable to adverse shocks to the international financial system. A more balanced relationship between the major players might help to induce each of them to take on responsibility for contributing to a stable global environment. In many ways, the ECB as part of the Eurosystem is already represented in international institutions and fora. Although some decisions are still under consideration, formal and informal agreements have already been reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and in the G-7 and G-10 context. Most recently, the IMF has granted observer status to the ECB. The IMF, as the cornerstone of the international financial system, plays a key role in the process of multilateral surveillance of economic policies. Therefore, it is important for the ECB to be represented at the IMF from the outset of Stage Three of EMU, given the respective mandates of both institutions.      Architecture of the international monetary system    I should also like to make a few remarks on the renewed interest in the concept of target zones for exchange rates among the main currency blocs, namely the United States, the euro area and Japan. In a world characterised by highly integrated and sophisticated international financial markets, there is serious doubt whether target zones for exchange rates are feasible. Apart from the obvious risks of undermining price stability, such exchange rate targets would, in essence, imply that domestic policy objectives would have to be subordinated to external requirements. This is the reason why the exchange rate is not an explicit aim of our monetary policy. This stance is based on the conviction that the exchange rate of the euro is the outcome, rather than an objective in itself, both of the economic, monetary and other policies pursued in the euro area, and of cyclical developments in the euro area and abroad. Of course, this does not mean that we shall neglect the exchange rate of the euro. Exchange rate developments are monitored carefully in the context of our broadly based assessment of future price developments. Moreover, the euro exchange rate plays a far smaller role in the euro area than it played in the individual Member States in the past, which is also a consequence of the fact that the euro area is larger in size and is therefore less dependent on external trade than each individual Member State was before. In line with the Eurosystem\\'s approach to the euro exchange rate, the EU Ministers of Finance, who are ultimately responsible for the exchange rate policy of the euro, agreed in December 1997 to issue \"general orientations\" only in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of clear and persistent misalignments of the euro. It seems to me we have not reached that stage.   ']\n",
      "['1999-01-14', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The euro has arrived', 'Speech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg to the American European Community Association on 14 January 1999 at De Nederlandsche Bank in Amsterdam', '  The euro has arrived   Speech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg to the American European Community Association on 14 January 1999 at De Nederlandsche Bank in Amsterdam The euro has arrived! This was a very happy occasion. Although it has yet to appear in the tangible form of new banknotes and coins, there is no doubt that the new currency is set to play an important role, both in the euro area and beyond. After years of intensive preparation and successful economic convergence, a single monetary policy for the entire euro area determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) is now being implemented by the Eurosystem, which is made up of the ECB and the eleven national central banks (NCBs) of the participating Member States.    The changeover weekend   The technical and logistical challenges posed by the changeover to the euro over the weekend of the New Year\\'s Day public holiday have been successfully met. During the changeover weekend the Eurosystem monitored the conversion activities at the ECB, at the participating NCBs and at certain private institutions which - in the view of the Eurosystem - represent the core of the financial infrastructure in the euro area. Regular contacts were also maintained with other EU and non-EU central banks and the European Commission. This monitoring activity during the changeover weekend was justified by the concern that, owing to the extraordinary concentration of operational risks within all the institutions of the banking and financial industry, events could occur immediately prior to the launch of Stage Three of EMU which might either impinge on the orderly conditions in the monetary system or create risks for financial stability at the very start of Monetary Union. The decision-making bodies of the ECB stood ready to gather for extraordinary meetings via teleconference, if necessary. During the changeover weekend, no incidents that could have impaired the smooth start of Stage Three were reported to the Eurosystem. The successful navigation of the changeover weekend was the result of considerable and thorough preparation by a very large set of public and private institutions, including the ECB and the NCBs. Indeed, the introduction of the euro marks the culmination of a great deal of successful preparatory work over a period of many years. This has been reflected in the positive and confident way in which financial markets have received the euro in the first two weeks of Monetary Union. Although some minor problems of a technical nature could not be avoided, overall the TARGET payments system has functioned well and contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market. A number of \"teething troubles\" have been experienced as participants - in both commercial banks and central banks - adapt to the new system and environment. Nevertheless, during these early days of Monetary Union, TARGET has handled more cross-border payments than were anticipated, thereby demonstrating its processing capacity. With regard to monetary operations, on 4 January the Eurosystem announced its first main refinancing operation, which was successfully completed on the following day.   The role of monetary policy   A successful monetary policy must always be forward-looking, acting to contain threats to price stability before they become entrenched. Therefore, today I should also like to look to the future. Monetary Union is a unique and significant achievement. It promises a credible and lasting environment of price stability for almost 300 million people. This stable environment is the foundation for sustainable economic growth, better employment prospects and improvements in the standard of living throughout the euro area. Price stability is a necessary condition for improved economic performance in all these areas. I am confident that the single monetary policy will make the greatest possible contribution in this regard. The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy announced by the Governing Council last year, and which is now guiding monetary policy decisions, was designed with this goal in mind. Nevertheless, monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe\\'s economic problems. Appropriate fiscal policies and structural reforms implemented by national governments are vital and considerable progress is required in these areas. Moreover, continued wage moderation in both the public and private sectors would contribute to reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment in many parts of the euro area. Unemployment in the euro area is largely structural in origin. Implementing an inflationary monetary policy will not solve this problem, but rather exacerbate it over the medium term, as inflation distorts investment and saving decisions, raises the risk premium in long-term interest rates and undermines the allocative efficiency of the price mechanism. Only effective structural policies that improve the flexibility and efficiency of labour and goods markets can reduce unemployment in a successful and lasting manner. I appreciate that these structural reforms are not always easy to implement, not least because the benefits they yield occur mainly in the medium to long term. However, they are unavoidable. In those euro area countries that have taken up the challenge of structural reform, unemployment has fallen significantly. Other euro area countries should and must take note: structural reform throughout the euro area is fundamental to the success of Monetary Union and to improving Europe\\'s economic performance.   The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy   The Treaty on European Union assigned the ESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. You may rest assured that the Governing Council of the ECB is totally committed to fulfilling this mandate. In order to meet this commitment, the Governing Council has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy consisting of three main elements. First, in order to give clear guidance in relation to expectations of future price developments, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective. Defining price stability also serves the principles of transparency and accountability. It clarifies how the Treaty\\'s mandate is interpreted by the Governing Council and gives the public clear guidance concerning its assessment of the success of the single monetary policy. Price stability has therefore been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Needless to say, deflation - that is, a persistent fall in the price level - would not be consistent with price stability. The annual rate of inflation in the most recent available data, measured on this harmonised basis, is consistent with the definition of price stability. The Eurosystem has therefore enjoyed the good fortune to assume monetary sovereignty in the euro area in an environment of price stability, owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence achieved by national central banks during the last decade. Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. This reflects the need for monetary policy to be forward-looking and to have a medium-term orientation. It recognises the fact that monetary policy is not able to control all short-term movements in the price level. To maintain price stability according to this published definition, the Governing Council\\'s strategy relies on two pillars. First, a prominent role has been assigned to money, in recognition of the monetary origins of inflation over the longer term. This prominent role is reflected in the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3. The first reference value has been set at an annual rate of 4 1/2%. The reference value for M3 is consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, while allowing for sustainable output growth and taking account of the trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3. Monetary policy will not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a \"mechanistic\" way. In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed for the signals that they offer with regard to the prospects for price developments. If the deviation points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempting to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council of the ECB recognises that it is important, in parallel with the assessment of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators, including economic forecasts. This systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions will ensure that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when taking monetary policy decisions.   Recent developments in monetary policy   A moment ago, I emphasised the importance of the formal introduction of the euro on New Year\\'s Day. However, co-operation among European national central banks has been close for a long time and, among the NCBs of the countries participating in Stage Three, has become increasingly so in recent years and months. The co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December last year is an illustration of this co-operation. This co-ordinated interest rate move was thoroughly discussed by the members of the Governing Council of the ECB. De jure, the decision to change interest rates had to be taken by the national central banks, but, de facto, Monetary Union existed in all but name prior to its formal implementation on 1 January 1999. At its first December meeting, the Governing Council made a thorough assessment of the latest monetary data and other economic indicators, noting in particular the decline in business confidence in the euro area arising, in part, from the deteriorating external environment. This deterioration in the international economy has its origins, to a large extent, in the Asian and Russian financial crises. Following its appraisal of both pillars of the monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council concluded that key central bank interest rates of 3% would best serve the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term. National central banks adjusted their interest rates accordingly. This co-ordinated interest rate move allowed the ECB to announce that the new level of interest rates would prevail \"for the foreseeable future\". In other words, in the absence of further disturbances to the economy or the emergence of new and unanticipated threats to price stability, this level of interest rates should be appropriate to fulfil the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term. This announcement helped to resolve some uncertainty at a time when the practical, technical and logistical tasks necessitated by the changeover weekend were uppermost in our minds and in those of market participants. Following the second Governing Council meeting in December, I was therefore able to announce that the interest rate on the first main refinancing operation of the Eurosystem would also be 3%. Moreover, the interest rates for the deposit and marginal lending facilities - which, in normal circumstances, would constitute the upper and lower bounds for overnight market interest rates - were set at 2% and 4.5% respectively. As a transitional measure to help the financial system adjust to the new institutional environment resulting from the transition to Stage Three, from 4 January until 21 January a narrower band of 2.75% to 3.25% has been set for the rates on the deposit and marginal lending facilities. During the first few days of Stage Three we observed a relatively large recourse by credit institutions to these facilities. This was to be expected, given the relatively narrow spread between the Eurosystem\\'s marginal lending facility and the overnight money market rate. Although the narrow corridor is intended to facilitate the transition by market participants to the new regime, over a longer period of time such a measure would hamper the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market. We therefore intend to terminate the transitional measure of the narrow band next week, in line with our pre-announced schedule.   Assessment of the current economic situation   At the meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB on 7 January it was confirmed that the 3% rate would apply to the Eurosystem\\'s next two main refinancing operations. This level is based on the Governing Council\\'s current assessment of the economic situation, viewed from the perspective of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. First, monetary growth in recent months has been broadly in line with the quantitative reference value. This, together with further analysis of the monetary data, signals that monetary developments are consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Of course, monetary growth relative to the reference value should always be interpreted in a medium-term context. Short-run deviations from the reference value are inevitable and, while being monitored and assessed carefully, would not automatically signal an immediate threat to price stability. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that the three-month moving average of the annual growth rates of M3 up to November 1998 stood at 4.7%, very close to the reference value of 4 1/2%. Second, as regards the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments, a number of indicators have recently proved noteworthy. Following the co-ordinated interest rate cut at the beginning of December, long-term interest rates have also fallen, suggesting that financial markets viewed the cut favourably and considered it to be consistent with the credible maintenance of price stability over the medium term. The indicators emerging from the real economy are mixed. Overall, real GDP growth in the euro area weakened in the third quarter of last year as compared with the first half. While business confidence, orders and capacity utilisation have developed less favourably in recent months, the latest data for employment, retail sales and consumer confidence suggest more favourable trends. Against this background, the annual rate of increase in the HICP for the euro area slowed further in November, falling to 0.9% as compared with 1.0% in the previous two months. This reduction in the rate of increase of the HICP resulted from further moderation of food price increases and continued falls in energy prices. On balance, the general environment continued to suggest that there is no significant upward or downward pressure on the price level. Of course, the Governing Council is fully aware that potential risks to price stability do exist. On the one hand, the external environment could again deteriorate if the financial crises in Asia and Russia were to spread or deepen further. On the other, fiscal indiscipline by national governments failing to respect the Stability and Growth Pact or inflationary wage settlements could threaten the 2% upper bound of the Eurosystem\\'s published definition of price stability. The Governing Council is monitoring all these developments very closely and will react in a prompt and pre-emptive manner to ensure that neither inflationary nor deflationary pressures take hold.    The international role of the euro and the ECB   Changes in the external environment - that is, in the economic condition and performance of countries outside the euro area - may affect the outlook for price developments within the euro area, and thereby the conduct of the single monetary policy. The effects of financial crises on external demand and business confidence are a notable recent example. However, this relationship works in both directions. The introduction of the euro has created a single currency area of a size and importance and with a population broadly similar to the United States. An event of this magnitude is likely to have major implications for the rest of the world, especially the international financial system. In the remainder of my speech, I shall consider some of these implications. In its monetary policy strategy, the Eurosystem deliberately does not specify a target for the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar or the Japanese yen. Although it will always stand ready to exchange views with other central banks concerning the development of exchange rates, there are no explicit or implicit target zones for the euro exchange rate against non-EU currencies. The euro area is a large, relatively closed economy, similar in this respect to the United States. Pursuing a target for the euro exchange rate could easily jeopardise the maintenance of price stability. The level of interest rates required to sustain an exchange rate target may, in some cases, not be that which best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. I might add that it may also conflict with the achievement of other domestic policy objectives. It could be very painful if it were necessary to raise interest rates in a recession in order to defend the exchange rate of the euro. Finally, it should be acknowledged that today we are living in a world with high capital mobility. Exchange rate arrangements that could be implemented thirty years ago may no longer be feasible. The required amount of foreign exchange reserves could simply be too large. Within the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy strategy, the euro exchange rate is the outcome of current and expected economic policies and developments in both the euro area and elsewhere, and of the market participants\\' perception of these policies and developments. Supporting the Eurosystem\\'s approach, the Ministers of Finance, who are assigned ultimate responsibility for the exchange rate of the euro by the Maastricht Treaty, have agreed not to issue so-called \"general orientations\" for the exchange rate policy to the Eurosystem other than in clearly exceptional circumstances, such as when there is a substantial and persistent misalignment of the euro against other currencies. However, the absence of a target for the exchange rate of the euro against major international currencies does not imply that the ECB ignores or is indifferent to the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar or the Japanese yen. The exchange rate will be monitored as one of the indicators of monetary policy, within the broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments that constitutes one pillar of the overall strategy. Nor does the absence of exchange rate targets suggest that these rates will necessarily be unstable or volatile. On the contrary, the pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies puts in place one of the major prerequisites for stable euro exchange rates. The Eurosystem\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is a significant contribution in this regard. Absolute stability of the exchange rate is, of course, impossible to guarantee. It would not even be desirable if, for example, the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles that were not fully synchronised. This possibility cannot be ruled out, as even recent history has shown. We are aware that the emergence of an international role for the euro may sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy if a significant proportion of the money stock is circulating outside the euro area. Nevertheless, the Eurosystem will accept the international role of the euro as it develops as a result of market forces. To the extent that the Eurosystem is successful in meeting its mandate and maintaining price stability, it will also automatically foster the use of the euro as an international currency. The pace at which the euro will emerge as an international currency is hard to predict. If history is taken as a guide, it will be a gradual process, but it is possible that, in today\\'s more dynamic and flexible financial markets, the euro could assume a prominent role more rapidly than past experience might suggest. Finally, I should like to discuss briefly the role of the ECB in international co-operation. As the representative of a monetary union comparable in size and importance to the United States and as the central bank managing a currency that is likely to play a large and increasing international role, the ECB will inevitably play an important role in the international financial system. The ECB will embrace the implied responsibility, but at the same time it will have to be modest and realistic in its actions on the international stage. Its role will develop over time, drawing on the experience of those national central banks that have played an important international role in the past. At the end of last year, the ECB was accorded observer status at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Full membership of the IMF is restricted to individual nations. Nevertheless, this observer status will allow the ECB to participate fully in the relevant work and assessment by the Fund of economic policies in the euro area and beyond. The ECB also participates in the work of the G-7, the G-10, the Bank for International Settlements and the OECD. It enjoys good bilateral relations with other central banks throughout the world. The ECB stands ready to participate fully in, and contribute to, international policy discussions. It will, of course, offer expertise and exchange views, when and where appropriate. However, in general, the best contribution the ECB can make to a stable international monetary system, including stable exchange rates and well-functioning international capital markets, is to maintain price stability within the euro area. Fulfilling the mandate assigned to the ESCB by the Treaty on European Union will help the ECB to meet its international responsibilities.   Concluding remarks   The euro has arrived. The Governing Council of the ECB has taken up the reins of monetary sovereignty in the euro area and a truly single monetary policy has been in place for two weeks. For those of us who have been involved in the long and at times arduous preparations for Monetary Union, this is an occasion which provides a sense of satisfaction. However, as I have outlined in this speech, in many ways the real work of the ECB is only just beginning. The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is in place. I am confident that this framework will enable the Governing Council to fulfil the Treaty mandate of maintaining price stability. Meeting this mandate will ensure that the single monetary policy makes its best possible contribution to improving the standard of living in the euro area and helping to ensure the stability of the international financial system.

      "['1998-12-31', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Statement at the joint press conference following the ECOFIN meeting', 'Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB in Brussels on 31 December 1998', \"  Statement at the joint press conference following the ECOFIN meeting   Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB in Brussels on 31 December 1998 A few minutes ago the Council adopted the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro. It did so upon a proposal from the Commission of the European Communities and after consultation of the European Central Bank (ECB). Earlier today the Governing Council of the ECB held a meeting by means of a teleconference to approve the ECB's legal Opinion. I have delivered that ECB Opinion personally to the Council.  Today's decision is a historic one. In the end it turned out to be almost a formality - different from what many of us might have expected barely a year ago. First, this can be attributed to the credibility of the convergence process. Second, we also owe this to the pre-announcement early in May of this year that the ERM central rates would be used for today's process to fix the conversion rates.  Today's decision was the last of many decisions to make possible the introduction of the euro, a new currency for almost 300 million people in eleven countries. This last decision was as simple as it is far-reaching. A currency is far more than just a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value - important though these properties already are. A currency is also part of the identity of a people. It reflects what they have in common, now and in the future. May the euro become a unifying symbol for the people of Europe.  I also feel quite touched - personally - by today's events. I have been involved in the process leading to the creation of the single currency for more than twenty years now, first as a Minister of Finance and later as a central banker. Now we have made it. From now on, monetary policy, usually an essential part of national sovereignty, will be decided by a truly European institution, the ECB. This will be a great challenge. I can assure you that we shall do our utmost to make the euro a currency in which European citizens will be able to place their trust. The euro has to become a currency which will keep its value over time and contribute to a stable, prosperous and peaceful Europe.   \"]\n",
      "['1998-12-22', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Introductory statement with Q&A', 'Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank', '  ECB Press conference: Introductory statement   Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today\\'s meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank at which we took the opportunity to finalise a number of issues of a rather technical or legal nature ahead of the forthcoming Changeover Weekend.  Let me first turn to the Governing Council\\'s discussion on recent economic, monetary and  financial developments and the decisions that the Governing Council has taken today in the field of monetary policy.   On 1 January 1999 the ESCB will assume responsibility for defining and implementing the single monetary policy of the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB deemed it appropriate to announce in advance the interest rates that will apply to the monetary policy instruments of the ESCB as from the start of Stage Three. This should eliminate any remaining uncertainties about the monetary policy stance of the ESCB and contribute to a smooth changeover to Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union.  As you have already been informed, the following decisions were taken:      First, the Governing Council decided to conduct the first main refinancing operation of the ESCB as a fixed rate tender and to set the level of the interest rate for this operation at 3%, in line with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two. This operation will be initiated on 4 January 1999 , the allotment decision will be taken on 5 January 1999 , and the settlement will take place on 7 January 1999 . The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January. The Governing Council today already decided that it will be conducted through the single variable rate auction procedure.    Second, with respect to the interest rates on the ESCB\\'s standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 4.50% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2%. These are the rates of the ESCB\\'s standing facilities at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999 .    Third, however, as a transitory measure , between 4 January and 21 January, the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2.75%. This exceptional narrow corridor, of 50 basis points, between the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility aims at smoothing the adaptation of market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union. The maintenance of such a narrow corridor is not desirable beyond the short term, since it would hamper the development of an efficient euro area money market. Therefore, the Governing Council intends to terminate this measure following its meeting on 21 January 1999 . In summary, let me provide the following explanations for these decisions. I will start with issues related to the narrow corridor; thereafter, I will comment on the level of the interest rates.      With respect to the interest rates on the ESCB\\'s standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council had to consider two aspects. First, it needed to signal clearly its monetary policy intentions. These were expressed by setting the rate for the marginal lending facility at 4.50% and the rate for the deposit facility at 2% for the start of Stage Three. Hence, the corridor for movements in short-term interest rates is asymmetric towards the upper boundary. Determining these rates was also necessary in order to provide successors to the official national central bank rates previously used as reference rates in certain legislation and contracts in some Member States. Second, however, the Governing Council also had to consider the possibility that market participants may need some time to get used to the new environment for monetary policy. In principle, cross-country deviations of short-term interest rates will not exist in Stage Three, as intra euro area arbitrage should be expected to prevent this. However, the many novelties related to the changeover make it difficult to foresee whether the euro area money market will indeed work in a fully integrated way immediately from the very first day of Stage Three. For this reason, the Governing Council has decided to use a relatively narrow corridor of interest rates on the standing facilities of the ESCB in the first three weeks of Stage Three as an automatic device to reduce the maximum range of fluctuations in the overnight interest rate. Accordingly, we have temporarily designed an exceptional corridor of only 50 basis points, with the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2.75% which we intend to terminate on 21 January 1999 .  Concerning the decision to set the level of the interest rate for the first main refinancing  operation of the ESCB at 3%, it may be recalled that on 3 December 1998, in a co-ordinated decision, all national central banks participating in the single monetary policy lowered their key interest rates to 3% (with the exception of the Banca d\\'Italia, which reduced the discount rate to 3.5%). As explained by the ECB at that time, this joint reduction had to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three and which it intended to maintain for the foreseeable future. It was based on the common assessment that these interest rate reductions are in line with maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. In this connection, it is to be pointed out that a rate of 3% is very low by historical standards. This should be seen as clear indication that the ESCB does not want to give any signal for a further easing in the foreseeable future. At today\\'s meeting, taking account of the latest monetary, financial and economic data, the Governing Council confirmed these views. At this juncture, there are no signs to suggest either that current rates of increase in the HICP of around 1% would decelerate significantly, or, conversely, accelerate to levels which are inconsistent with the definition of price stability provided by the ESCB in October 1998.  Let me provide you with a more detailed record of our assessment.   The information coming from the data on monetary aggregates signals a relatively smooth path for M3 growth in 1998, compatible with continued price stability. In particular, the latest three-month moving average annual growth rate of M3 stood at around 4.5%. This was exactly in line with the reference value set by the Governing Council at its last meeting.  With respect to the other pillar of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy, the broadly based  assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to price stability, various indicators confirm the assessment of developments in monetary data. The further reduction of long-term interest rates by almost 20 basis points since the end of November to a level of 3.9% on 21 December, as well as the downward shift in the yield curve, can be regarded as a sign that markets expect the environment of price stability to continue. From the point of view of the Governing Council, it is an encouraging signal that financial market participants are apparently prepared to attribute a credibility bonus to our stability-oriented monetary policy shortly before its official start.  At the current juncture, the outlook for the euro area economy is still very much influenced by the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the world economy in 1999. These uncertainties have affected negatively indicators of industrial confidence in the euro area and have fuelled expectations of a slowdown in economic activity in the short term. Very recently, a first estimate of real GDP growth in the euro area in the third quarter of 1998 has been released by EUROSTAT, suggesting a growth rate of 2.4% against the third quarter of 1997. This would be around one-half of a percentage point lower than the average growth rate of 3% in the first half of 1998, compared with the first half of 1997. Other indicators of real activity were mixed up to November. While order books and capacity utilisation point to a less optimistic assessment of growth prospects, consumer confidence remained high and retail sales continued to increase at a broadly stable pace up to September, i.e. the latest month for which data are available. Also, the decline in unemployment, after having paused in the summer months, resumed, with the rate of unemployment decreasing from 10.9% in September to 10.8% in October. The factors underpinning the currently low increases in the HICP continued to include falling energy prices, downward movements in producer prices, subdued wage growth and slight decreases in unit labour costs. On balance, the overall environment described above does not point to significant upward or downward pressure on prices in the short term, as also reflected in all available forecasts for 1999.  Nevertheless, factors contributing to risks to price stability on both sides need to be taken into account. On the one hand, downward risks relate to the global environment and potential repercussions on the euro area, for example via import prices and further pressure on producer prices. These developments will be monitored closely. On the other hand, unexpected upward pressure on wages and a relaxation of the fiscal stance would clearly alter the general environment. Therefore, we will also carefully monitor the outcome of ongoing wage rounds, the plans for fiscal policy in 1999 and over the medium term, as well as their implementation towards compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.  In conclusion, the actual situation, characterised by monetary growth compatible with continued price stability and the absence of immediate upward or downward pressure on prices, justifies maintaining the current stance of monetary policy, with an ECB interest rate of 3% for the main refinancing facility. As we indicated in the ECB press release of 3 December 1998 , the intention was also to maintain this rate \"for the foreseeable future\". Indeed, monetary policy in Stage Three starts with interest rates which are very low by historical standards.  Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the final  preparatory work for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary  Union    (1) Preparations for the changeover to the single currency   On 11 December 1998 the ECB issued a press release on the practical issues relating to the forthcoming Changeover Weekend as a follow-up to the information provided in the press release issued on 3 November 1998 . At its meeting today, the Governing Council took stock of the state of the preparations of the ECB and of the national central banks and took note of the very detailed planning which has been co-ordinated by the special Changeover Weekend Committee which the Governing Council set up in November. The Governing Council also took note of the outcome of the recent \"dress rehearsal\", which had simulated the full operational activity of the ESCB using normal systems and procedures and, if they were to fail, contingency procedures.  In line with the announcement made in the Joint Communique issued on 2 May 1998 - by the Ministers of the Member States adopting the euro as their single currency, the Governors of the central banks of those Member States, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute - the Governing Council reconfirmed today that appropriate market techniques would be used to ensure that on 31 December 1998 the market exchange rates, recorded during the teleconference held between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. (C.E.T.) and used for calculating the daily exchange rates of the official ECU will be equal to the ERM bilateral central rates. These bilateral central rates were published in the Joint Communique in the form of a parity grid.  The ECB has also been involved in the testing of the procedures to be applied to the fixing of the irrevocable euro conversion rates so as to minimise the likelihood that technical problems might arise on 31 December 1998 . As part of the process of fixing these rates, the Governing Council - in consultation with the General Council of the ECB - will adopt by special teleconference its formal Opinion on a proposal from the European Commission, which the ECB President will deliver personally to the specially convened session of the Council of the European Union in Brussels in the early afternoon of 31 December 1998. The ECB and the NCBs will contribute to the efforts to publicise the information on the irrevocable euro conversion rates by publishing them on their respective web sites. Contemporaneously, the ECB will send a S.W.I.F.T. broadcast message to the whole banking community in the world to confirm the rates of the eleven currencies against the euro.  The Governing Council agreed that, as of 1 January 1999 , the ECB will fully change over to the euro. As a consequence, the staff of the ECB will be remunerated in euro with effect from that date.   (2)  EONIA   The Governing Council took stock of the final preparations being made for the calculation of the Euro OverNight Indexed Average interest rate - to be more simply known as EONIA. This will be calculated on the basis of data supplied by a panel of banks in the European Union.  The EONIA will be published each day, starting on Monday, 4 January 1999 .   (3)  The authority of the ECB concerning the issuance of national banknotes   With the start of Stage Three, banknotes and coins denominated in the national currencies of the eleven participating Member States will become sub-divisions of the euro from that date onwards. Although euro banknotes and coins will not be put into circulation until 1 January 2002, from 1 January 1999 the right to authorise the issue of national banknotes - and the right to approve the volume of national coins to be issued - will belong to the Governing Council of the ECB.  With regard to the issue of national banknotes during the three years until euro banknotes are put into circulation, the Governing Council agreed today to develop a set of common procedures by the spring of 1999 to be followed by the participating national central banks when requesting authorisation to issue national banknotes. Similarly, on an annual basis, the national central banks will submit estimates to the ECB of the volume of national coins to be issued.   (4)  Logistics of the 2002 cash changeover   In connection with the preparations for the 2002 cash changeover, the Governing Council addressed the issue of \"front-loading\", i.e. the distribution of euro banknotes and coins prior to 1 January 2002 to certain target groups. A final decision will be taken in the first week of 1999.   (5)  1998 Annual Report and the ECB\\'s first Monthly Bulletin   The Governing Council agreed that the 1998 Annual Report covering the first six months of the life of the ECB and the transition from the EMI will be released to the media on Thursday, 15 April 1999 .  It was also agreed to release the ECB\\'s first Monthly Bulletin on Tuesday, 19 January 1999 .   (6)  Swap agreements with the Federal Reserve System and Norges Bank   The Governing Council took the opportunity of the forthcoming introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 to review and adjust existing swap agreements between euro area central banks, on the one hand, and the Federal Reserve System and Norges Bank, on the other hand. First, the Governing Council jointly agreed with the Federal Reserve System that the existing bilateral agreements of six euro area national central banks - namely, the central banks of Belgium , Germany , France , Italy , the Netherlands and Austria - with the Federal Reserve System will be allowed to lapse as they expire. Second, the current swap agreements between euro area national central banks and Norges Bank will be replaced by a new swap agreement between the ECB and Norges Bank amounting to €1,535 million as from 1 January 1999 .   (7)  ECB budget for 1999   The Governing Council approved the ECB\\'s budget for 1999, which gives the ECB the green light to recruit around 150 additional staff (both permanent and temporary) needed to support the new operational activities which the ECB will take on from 1 January 1999 . This will bring the ECB\\'s permanent staff to around 700, with nearly 50 limited contract staff.  We stand ready to take any questions you might have.       Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB     Question: Mr. Duisenberg, you said that the Council wanted to give a clear indication that the ESCB does not want to give any signal for further easing. The asymmetric range of interest rates around the 3%, is this an indication based on today’s knowledge that the next move in interest rates at some point in the medium term may well be upwards rather than downwards. Is that the signal the asymmetric range is supposed to give?  Duisenberg: No, that is not a signal that it is supposed to give. The only signal that we do want to give is - and I cannot state it more clearly than I do now - is that markets do not expect a change in interest rates in the foreseeable future.   Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, you said that as from 3 December all central banks have a key interest rate of 3% apart from the Banca d’Italia. Do you mean that on the basis of today’s decision the Banca d’Italia should lower its discount rate or could it in principle continue like this until 31 December?   Duisenberg: Theoretically, yes; but in any case it is a matter that is entirely up to the Banca d’Italia to decide. It remains fully autonomous until 31 December of this year.  Question: Mr. Duisenberg, the summit in Vienna decided to adopt a European employment pact by June. What is your position on this initiative?  Duisenberg: My position is one of \"wait-and-see\" because I was not involved in it; and we shall wait until we see the \"employment pact \"- as I believe it is called - in the course of the next six months.  Question (translation): There is a certain number of economies who are a little fearful of the start to the euro because they fear that it might make them less competitive in the short and medium term. How do you view this and what do you think the influence is going to be on the problems in Asia and those under pressure from the crisis in Asia?  Noyer (translation): I assume that your question is really aimed at a potential upward pressure which the euro might suffer from at the beginning of next year. Well, I confess that we have no particular reason to think that that would happen. Consequently we have to wait and see what happens on the exchange markets. That depends mainly upon market forces; and there is absolutely no reason to believe there will be a sudden upward pressure, a sudden upward appreciation, in the value of the euro. In any case we have always said that we are looking for a sound, stable euro and of course we also hope that the other leading currencies, in particular the US dollar, will also be stable, sound currencies and remain as stable as possible. I can’t really say anything more than that.   Question: A question for the President: Would you agree that deflation at present represents a greater danger to the euro area than inflation? And if that danger becomes imminent, what will you do about it?  Duisenberg: As I already stated in my introductory remarks, we see at the present time no signals either for inflation to move downwards, nor for it to move in an upward direction. So, your question precisely was: would you agree on that? The answer is: I don’t agree.   Question: It was a very rapid worldwide portfolio shift into the euro. What will this do to your 4.5% reference value for the growth in M3? If there’s very rapid investment worldwide in the euro, people moving their portfolios into euro, will this make your monetary target unsustainable?  Duisenberg: That would depend on the size. But we would, of course, try to counter such a very rapid movement into the euro to the extent possible. The reference value is meant for the medium term; it is not meant to be changed rather quickly. We have said we will reassess the validity of the reference value in December next year.  Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I wanted to ask about this asymmetric corridor. I didn’t quite understand what you said, perhaps. Why have you opted for an asymmetric corridor if your purpose was not to say that the inclination of the ECB would be in a particular direction?   Duisenberg: The basic decision, really, is to make it a band of 250 basis points. That cannot always be placed precisely around the current repo rate. Although we intend to maintain it for the foreseeable future, at some time it will be changed, that is sure. There will come a moment in time when the repo rate may be changed and then the symmetry would have been lost anyway. So we do not give so much prominence to the idea of symmetry around a rate which is set every two weeks. And if - at any rate - you were to interpret it as a move which would signal that markets should not expect a further easing of monetary policy in the near future, then that interpretation would not be unwelcome to us.   Question (translation): Mr. President, we are still learning, and that’s why I’m asking you the question. Are there reasons - other than inflation in the conjuncture - why interest rates might rise? If, for example, too much money were to flow from Europe to the United States where interest rates are higher? Could that in given circumstances be a reason? I’m asking the question because we are still learning.  Duisenberg: The earlier question pointed in the opposite direction – i.e. that money would flow to Europe rather than the other way around. If it were to flow away, because interest rates elsewhere were more attractive and given the risks for the exchange rate that would go along with that, then it could happen that at some point there would be repercussions on the growth rate of the monetary aggregate. And if it were also to have an impact on other economic valuables, then that could lead to a reaction in monetary policy. But I cannot indicate when, where and how much.   Question: Mr. Duisenberg, we are very near in approaching this historic moment of the start of Stage Three of Monetary and Economic Union; what advice would you give to governments at this moment so that the euro is a success, and do you think that fiscal policies are now adequate to achieve this success?  Duisenberg: My advice (if I am permitted to give advice to governments, and if I am not permitted, I will give it anyway) is to stick to their policies as they have outlined them themselves in the Stability and Growth Pact: that is, to continue to exude an image of continuity and stability and the political impetus to achieve - over the medium term - balanced budgets or even a small surplus; and what I would advise governments to do is to inspire that feeling of continuity and stability sooner rather than later.  Question: Mr. Duisenberg, could you just say a few words about expectations concerning the introduction of the euro in ten days? You know that there are still a lot of people in Germany who expect the euro to be not as strong as the Deutsche Mark. Could you just say some words about your personal expectations? Will it be a strong currency and what do you think about the competition against the yen and the dollar? How will they live together?  Duisenberg: Well, we do not think about the exchange rates of the big currencies in the world in terms of competition. What we do hope and are after is that the euro will be a stable currency, more than anything else. Stability in the first place that it will be a currency characterised by price stability in the entire euro area and, as a result, then we would hope that it would also be a stable currency in its external relations, that is vis-à-vis the dollar and the yen in particular.  Question: Mr. Duisenberg, the ECB has set a very narrow band for the first three weeks of its existence. I have two questions concerning that: First one, would it be desired from your point of view that the national central banks would take similar measures for the time of the changeover weekend, and second, the narrow band is valid only for three weeks so far. Do you foresee or is it a possibility that the period in which such a narrow band might be needed would be longer?  Duisenberg: Well, as I said, it is the strong intention of the Governing Council to terminate this narrow band on 21 January. We think at the moment that a three-week period for markets to get used to the new environment and to become full players in the new game is enough. So we do not envisage that the period will be longer. No, we strongly intend to terminate this narrow band after three weeks. To totally exclude that it might be longer of course we can not do.  Question: Would you desire similar measures by the national central banks?  Duisenberg: No, we have not discussed that, and I would also expect the national central banks, also in the last four working days of this year, the transition period, to stay calm.  Question: Mr. President, does the fact that you see neither a need for easing nor a need for tightening, indicate that you think the euro is being launched under optimal economic conditions, and if not, what would make conditions more optimal?  Duisenberg: Well, the euro is being launched as far as Europe is concerned under optimal economic conditions. We would have been pleased if the international environment had been a little bit calmer than it has been over the past three to four months, but that by itself has not at all perturbed the process of the changeover. On the contrary, as I have repeatedly said, it is remarkable - and we are grateful for that - the extent to which the international turmoil has had no impact whatsoever on exchange rate developments inside the euro area and interest rate developments inside the euro area.  Question: (translation) Mr. Duisenberg, can you tell us what will be the theme of the ECB’s first Monthly Bulletin and what other publications is the ECB planning to produce? From the Bundesbank we are familiar with weekly balance sheet statements, monthly money supply figures, etc. Or are the data not yet ready, if the ECB has only the September data available? When will this be available? When shall we receive information in the form of regular documentation?  Duisenberg: The Monthly Bulletin will certainly contain the first time and every month thereafter an assessment of the current economic situation, similar to the one I have given to you in my introductory statement of today. The publication date of the Monthly Bulletin will be announced in a relatively short period from now, when we have finalised our schedule. The Monthly Bulletin will be complemented of course by the weekly publication of a consolidated balance sheet for the entire European System of Central Banks and then, in addition, we will publish new data when they become available; for the monetary aggregate, for example, this will be every month. We will publish them separately.  Question: Mr. Duisenberg, the recent reduction in interest rates to 3% has led to some observers asking questions about the transparency of the ECB. Could you say briefly once again why this reduction had to take place. Was it due to the economic cycle? Do you not see a risk that the ECB’s strategy could be criticised as being a cyclically-oriented monetary policy, which is then susceptible to slight political pressure, if it has no clear and binding link to the money supply, like the Bundesbank’s strategy up until now?  Duisenberg: I would deny that with all the force I have in me. As I have explained, as far as the co-ordinated reduction in key interest rates to 3% is concerned, I would rather be inclined to expect that it would be regarded as a remarkable consensus among the European national central banks, even weeks ahead of their obligatory consensus, which will start on 1 January 1999. In this connection, I almost have a counterquestion: as regards the so-called lack of transparency, don’t you mean, rather, that it was so totally unexpected by the markets and the media? And that that is what is now being called a lack of transparency. We are rather pleased about the unexpectedness of the move.  ']\n",

Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank', '  Hearing at the European Parliament\\'s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on 8 December 1998 in Brussels   Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank It is a great privilege for me to meet this Committee for the first time in my capacity as President of the European Central Bank (ECB). As was the case when I previously appeared before the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs, I hope that we shall have a frank and fruitful exchange of views. Since September, when I reported to your Sub-Committee, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has continued to make further progress in finalising the preparations for the start of Monetary Union on 1 January 1999, and I am happy to say that we are practically ready. The Governing Council has continued to have a very heavy agenda, dealing in the main with the specification of the Eurosystem\\'s monetary policy strategy, the regular monitoring of economic, monetary and financial developments as well as issues of a technical nature and legal implementation issues. Specifically, the Governing Council has met on three occasions since September. Following these meetings, the Vice-President and I have reported on the results of our deliberations at press conferences which were followed by question and answer sessions. Moreover, the statements made there were immediately made available in the form of press releases, together with various other documents explaining issues in more detail. The immediate release of this information to the press is a practice which I intend to continue in the future. From the start of next year, the Governing Council will meet every fortnight. The first meeting in each month will be followed by a press conference. We intend to publish a monthly bulletin, in the context of which we will explain in detail both our monetary and economic analysis and the assessment underlying our monetary policy decisions. Moreover, the members of the Executive Board also intend to be very active in giving speeches and interviews. The task of communicating and explaining our monetary policy is being taken very seriously. I should like to focus my remarks today on three areas, in particular. First - given its importance - I shall outline the monetary policy strategy which has been adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Second, I shall discuss the view of the Governing Council on the current economic situation in the euro area and on the outlook. Third, I shall summarise our recent preparatory work for the start of the single monetary policy. After that, I shall of course be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding these and other matters.   A. The monetary policy strategy in Stage Three   You are aware of the fact that the primary objective of the single monetary policy, as laid down in the Treaty, is to maintain price stability. In order to give clear guidance with regard to expectations of future price developments, and in the interests of accountability and transparency, it was agreed by the Governing Council to adopt a quantitative definition of this objective. Price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Needless to say, a persistent fall in the price level would not be consistent with the goal of price stability. The annual rate of inflation, measured on this harmonised basis, was 1.0% in October 1998. Overall, the objective of the ESCB is to maintain an environment of stable prices in the medium term. This reflects the need for monetary policy to be forward-looking, and to have a medium-term orientation. It recognises the reality that monetary policy is not able to control short-term movements in the price level. In October, the Governing Council announced that the monetary policy strategy would consist of two key elements and, just a week ago, it specified the remaining elements. First, a prominent role has been assigned to money, as is reflected in the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3. The first reference value has been set at an annual rate of 4 1/2%. It will be reviewed in December 1999. The reference value for M3 is consistent with the maintenance of price stability, while allowing for sustainable output growth. This rate was derived by assuming that the medium-term trend growth rate of real GDP in the euro area is estimated to be in the range of 2-2 1/2% per annum and the medium-term trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3 in the range of between 1/2-1% each year. In addition, it should be pointed out that monetary policy will not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a \"mechanistic\" way. The second key element of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly-based assessment both of the outlook regarding price developments and of the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council recognised that it would be important, in parallel to the assessment of money growth in relation to the reference value, also to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. The systematic analysis of all other relevant information about economic and financial conditions is designed to ensure that the Governing Council is as well-informed as possible when taking decisions about monetary policy.   B. Current economic developments and outlook   Against this background, the Governing Council discussed recent economic, monetary and financial developments in depth at its last meeting. The discussion included the consideration of available projections for both the world economy and the euro area in the next two years. Overall, these projections point to some deceleration of real GDP growth in the euro area in 1999, following growth in 1998 of just below 3% on the basis of current evidence. However, the general view is that this slowdown will be temporary. The Governing Council considers that the risks to economic activity continue to be on the downside. One reason for this is the continued uncertainty regarding the global environment. But there have been some positive signs lately, as world financial markets appear to have been calmer and less volatile in November. The Governing Council expressed its concern that, unless confidence is supported by appropriate economic policies, there could be a negative impact on domestic demand. In addition to the maintenance of a stability-oriented monetary policy, this requires, in particular, the conduct of fiscal policies which are consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact, wage developments which are in line with productivity gains and structural reforms in labour and product markets which will help to foster competitiveness and profitability in the corporate sector. This, in turn, will promote investment within the euro area and encourage employment growth. The main contribution that monetary policy can make to achieving sustained economic growth, higher employment levels and better living standards is to pursue the objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term. This objective was at the centre of our discussions regarding the appropriate level of the Eurosystem\\'s key interest rate for the euro area at the start of Stage Three. When the discussion of the appropriate level of interest rates was deepened further in early December, the Governing Council considered both the monetary data and the prospects for continued low increases in the HICP. At the present juncture, preliminary estimates put the average of the twelve-month growth rates of M3 for the last three months, up to October, at around 4.5%. Over the last two years, the annual rate of M3 growth in the euro area has fluctuated in a range of 3.5-5.5%. The Governing Council has come to the conclusion that this monetary trend currently appears to be broadly compatible with continued price stability in the euro area. If import prices remain subdued and wage developments continue to be moderate, then the rate of increase in the HICP is expected to stay below 2% in the foreseeable future. This prospect of low inflation is a view which financial markets appear to share, with average long-term interest rates in the euro area falling to a level just above 4% by the end of November. The Governing Council also considered the development of budgetary positions, emphasising that they are still far from being close to balance or in surplus and that debt ratios have remained at very high levels in many Member States. Any relaxation of the fiscal policy stance in the euro area, or a tendency to alter the strategy embodied in the Stability and Growth Pact would place the credibility of the euro and price stability at risk. Overall, the Governing Council has judged that the broad outlook for maintaining price stability is favourable. Against this background, there was a co-ordinated reduction of key interest rates by all national central banks in the euro area on 3 December 1998, reflecting a consensus reached in the Governing Council on the basis of a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area. Whereas all indicators suggest a favourable broad outlook for price stability, prospects for growth in the euro area have weakened, and the international environment is still dominated by uncertainty, so that the risks appear to be predominantly on the downside. The co-ordinated move on interest rates demonstrated that, in effect, Monetary Union has already begun. Moreover, this joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision about the level of interest rates with which the euro area will start Stage three of EMU and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.   C. Preparatory work for Stage Three   I should now like to elaborate briefly on some decisions other than those on the monetary policy strategy which have been taken by the Governing Council since September in the context of the preparatory work for Stage Three of EMU. First, the framework for our monetary policy instruments was completed with the specification of some final elements of the minimum reserve system. The ESCB will apply a reserve ratio of 2% on a specified liability base. An ECB Regulation was published last week, with which the features of the ESCB\\'s minimum reserve system have been set out in a legally binding text. Several major decisions were also taken with respect to TARGET, the real-time gross settlement system established by the ESCB. The ECB has published the third progress report on the TARGET project, providing further details on the legal framework and its technical implementation. The final text of the TARGET Guideline was adopted, and, last week, the TARGET Agreement was signed by the Governors of all 15 EU central banks and the President of the ECB. TARGET now stands ready to fulfil its task as the exclusive payment system to be used for all monetary policy-related operations with the Eurosystem as from the beginning of Stage Three. The Governing Council also approved the Guideline for the initial transfer of foreign reserves from the euro area national central banks to the ECB, as well as a set of legal documentation relating to the management of the ECB\\'s foreign reserves, which specifies the roles which the ECB and the euro area national central banks respectively will play in this regard. With respect to the management of domestic assets and liabilities, a further ECB Guideline was adopted, which sets out the reporting obligations of euro area national central banks vis-à-vis the ECB. Whenever they exceed a certain amount, such transactions are subject to prior approval by the ECB. These provisions are necessary to ensure the singleness of the ECB\\'s monetary policy. In order to strengthen the framework set up to prevent counterfeiting, the Governing Council confirmed the decision taken by the European Monetary Institute (EMI) to establish a Currency Analysis Centre and a Counterfeit Currency Database, which will store technical data relating to counterfeit euro banknotes and coins. The contents of the database will be made available to all national central banks of the EU Member States and to the respective law enforcement bodies involved in combating counterfeiting. Let me close my introductory statement with a few remarks on the preparations for the changeover weekend, the period from 31 December 1998 to the early morning of 4 January 1999. You are aware of the fact that, following the publication of the euro conversion rates, banking and financial institutions will have to finalise a broad range of migration operations to the euro under severe time constraints. Likewise, the ECB and the euro area national central banks will have to complete the final migration of their IT systems and operational procedures from the national currencies to the euro so as to ensure the availability of the entire complex infrastructure to the markets by the morning of 4 January 1999. In order to support a smooth transition to the euro, the Governing Council has set up a \"Changeover Weekend Committee\" which will organise the monitoring of developments regarding the final migration to the euro, both prior to and during the changeover weekend. An early-warning system has been established, consisting of central communication points at the ECB and at the euro area national central banks, which will monitor all relevant events which occur both within and outside the ESCB. In the case of unexpected events occurring in the banking and financial industry during the changeover weekend, the Governing Council will be prepared to take appropriate action. In such an event, the ECB will co-operate closely with other public authorities to orchestrate the necessary policy responses. Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal to answer any questions you may have.  ']\n",
      "['1998-12-08', 'Christian Noyer', 'A stability-oriented monetary policy strategy', 'Speech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro Seminar organised by PARIBAS on 8 December 1998 at the Hotel Okura in Tokyo', '  A stability-oriented monetary policy strategy   Speech by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro Seminar organised by PARIBAS on 8 December 1998 at the Hotel Okura in Tokyo In only twenty-three days\\' time, Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will commence in Europe. The introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 will mark a tremendous achievement, the culmination of more than a decade of preparation and convergence among the eleven initial participants in the euro area. In many ways, and within a medium-term perspective, the advent of the euro is creating great opportunities for Europe and the world economy. Monetary Union is a unique opportunity to establish and maintain a zone of price stability in the euro area. Price stability is at the core of the \"stability culture\" that we are establishing in Europe. By fulfilling the unambiguous commitment of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintaining price stability in the euro area, we will ensure that the single monetary policy contributes as much as possible to economic welfare in a broad sense. Indeed, we are already living in a de facto Monetary Union, as has been demonstrated by the coordinated move of their key interest rates by all central banks of the euro area on 3 December 1998, reflecting a consensus reached in the Governing Council on the basis of a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area. Whereas all indicators suggest a favourable broad outlook for price stability, prospects for growth for the euro area have weakened, and the international environment is still dominated by uncertainty, so that the risks appear to be predominantly on the downside. This joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the Eurosystem will start Stage Three of Monetary Union and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future. At the same time, fiscal authorities and general economic policies in Europe will also have a major contribution to make towards creating a unique stability culture. In this context the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, which was agreed by EU governments and aims at fostering the pursuit of disciplined fiscal policies, is a crucial element. The \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\" recently adopted by the Governing Council, and announced to the public two months ago, is at the heart of our approach. This monetary policy strategy, which I would like to explain first, is designed to ensure that the Governing Council can act in a forward-looking and pre-emptive manner, changing interest rates to contain inflationary or deflationary pressures before they become entrenched. In the second part of my speech, I should like to reflect on some of the possible implications of the introduction of the euro in the international field.    1. The ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy   The Treaty establishing the European Community assigns the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the primary objective of maintaining price stability. In the interest of transparency and accountability, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to publish a quantitative definition of price stability, against which its success in fulfilling the Treaty\\'s mandate can sensibly be judged by the public. At its October meeting the Governing Council of the ECB agreed that \"price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". With the HICP, a specific price index is identified against which the maintenance of price stability will be assessed. It was chosen because it is both sufficiently harmonised across the different countries of the euro area at the start of Stage Three and is consistent with the public\\'s usual focus on consumer prices. Using the index \"for the euro area\" highlights the fact that euro area-wide developments, rather than specific national or regional factors, will be the only determinants of decisions regarding the single monetary policy. This definition signals the aversion of the Governing Council to both inflation and deflation. The phrase \"below 2%\" clearly delineates the rate of inflation in the HICP deemed consistent with price stability. The wording \"year-on-year increases\" implies that decreases in the HICP - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be considered consistent with price stability either. In this manner, the Governing Council has clearly defined its objective, which is to be maintained over the medium term. By adopting this approach we are being realistic, acknowledging that some disturbances in the price level can occur in the short run - such as those caused by changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices - that cannot be controlled by monetary policy or by the ESCB. Such factors may lead to occasional falls in the HICP, or occasional increases above 2%. These are quite normal and consistent with a meaningful definition of price stability. However, the ESCB\\'s monetary policy will ensure that these transitory deviations from the definition do not become ingrained over the medium term. If and when we do not meet this primary objective, we are obliged to explain why that is the case and what we are going to do about this. Let me emphasise the overriding priority we attach to this objective. This priority is not only based on our legal obligations under the Treaty. It is also founded in our belief - confirmed by both decades of experience and a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research - that maintaining price stability in the euro area is a pre-requisite for a sustainable and lasting improvement in the standard of living of Europe\\'s citizens, and provides the foundation for improving growth and employment prospects in the future. In order to achieve price stability, the ESCB has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, which rests on two \"pillars\". The first pillar is a prominent role for money. This is deemed to be appropriate on account of the essentially monetary origins of inflation over the longer term. In parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, its strategy will also rest on a second \"pillar\". It will consist of a broadly-based assessment both of the outlook regarding price developments and of the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. This assessment will comprise a systematic analysis of all the other information on the economic and financial situation, ensuring that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when making its monetary policy decisions. Overall, this strategy ensures the greatest possible continuity with successful monetary strategies pursued in the euro area countries in the past. Nevertheless, it is an approach that reflects the special circumstances faced by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three. This strategy underlines the strong commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to its primary objective and should facilitate the achievement of this overriding goal. It will also ensure the transparency of the ESCB\\'s decision-making and its accountability. Based on its strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB will inform the public regularly and in detail about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and the reasoning behind specific policy decisions. As I have already indicated, there is a broad consensus that the development of the price level is a monetary phenomenon in the medium to long term. The historical experience of central banks in Europe and beyond clearly demonstrates that it is essential to carry out a thorough analysis of monetary aggregates and the information they contain. In particular, empirical evidence shows that increases in prices are relatively closely linked to rates of money growth in excess of the real growth capacity of the economy over the medium term. Consequently, monetary developments can provide useful information about future price developments and thereby offer an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy. Against this background, it is absolutely essential for any central bank that has the task of keeping prices stable to analyse and monitor developments in monetary aggregates closely. By way of an indication of the prominent role it attaches to money in the formulation of its monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB announced a quantitative reference value for monetary growth at its meeting on 1 December 1998. The reference value has two key features. First, it has been derived in a manner that is consistent with - and directed at achieving - price stability. Second, it has been constructed such that, in the absence of special factors or other distortions, deviations of monetary growth from the reference value will signal risks to price stability. In the future, the relationship between actual monetary growth and the pre-announced reference value will be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council. Where deviations emerge, an explanation will be sought. If such an explanation points towards a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react appropriately, but not in a mechanistic manner, in order to counter this threat. In contrast to a conventional monetary targeting regime, the ESCB is not, however, committed to correcting deviations of money growth from the reference value over the short term. One week ago the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on three important issues: first, the specific definition of a broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will be announced; second, whether a single figure or a range will be chosen for the reference value; and third, the precise level of the first reference value for monetary growth. In selecting the precise definition of the monetary aggregate that effectively serves the function of a reference value, both empirical and conceptual considerations were taken into account. Empirical economic studies have investigated the properties of various euro area-wide monetary aggregates, in particular in terms of their long-run stability and leading indicator properties. From a conceptual point of view it was considered of great importance also to include in the monetary aggregate those assets which have a high degree of substitutability with narrower definitions of money. The reference value will, therefore, refer to a relatively broad definition of M3, which, in addition to currency in circulation and deposits, also includes repos, money market paper, short-term debt securities issued and units or shares of money market funds. In setting the reference value for monetary growth, the Governing Council has taken account of various factors and emphasised its medium-term orientation. First, the Governing Council is committed to maintaining price stability according to its published definition. This requires increases in the HICP for the euro area of \"below 2%\". Second, the Governing Council takes the view that a figure in the range of 2% to 2 1/2 % per annum for the trend growth in real GDP in the euro area appears to be reasonable. Third, the uncertainties concerning short-term developments in velocity linked to the start of Stage Three have led the Governing Council to assume that the medium-term trend decline in velocity lies approximately within a range of 1/2% and 1% each year. This range reflects historical experience over the last twenty years. On the basis of these considerations, the Governing Council decided to set the reference value for monetary growth at 4 1/2%. The Governing Council has decided to announce a specific reference rate for monetary growth, rather than a range. The Council believes that announcing a reference range may be falsely interpreted as implying that interest rates would be changed automatically if the boundaries of the range were exceeded. This interpretation would not be consistent with the concept of a reference value, which - as emphasised in the announcement of the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy in October 1998 - does not imply a commitment to mechanistically correct any deviation of monetary growth from the reference value over the short term. The Governing Council of the ECB will monitor monetary developments against this reference value on the basis of the latest three-month moving averages of the monthly year-on-year growth rates for M3. This will ensure that erratic monthly outturns in the data owing to data revisions do not unduly distort the information contained in the aggregate. Although the monetary data contain information vital for monetary policy-making, monetary developments alone will not, of course, constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to take appropriate policy decisions. In the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, money is accorded a prominent - but not an exclusive - role. There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. Consequently, as I have pointed out, a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area aims at systematically analysing all the other available information about the economic and financial situation both within and beyond the euro area. However, the stability-oriented monetary strategy does not include the regular publication of inflation forecasts, for the following reasons. While it is true that accurate forecasts can contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy, the ESCB should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy of its internal forecasts. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability in the medium term should be used by the public to judge the success of the ESCB\\'s policies. Consequently, publication of the definition of price stability is important, as it helps to anchor inflation expectations, by increasing the clarity and transparency of the ultimate objective of the ESCB. The ESCB aims at defining price stability according to its announced quantitative definition. A credible commitment to this definition should provide the main anchor for inflation expectations, rather than an uncertain inflation forecast. In fact, it is not always transparent and appropriate to publish a forecast for future inflation, which might deviate, on the one hand, from the ESCB\\'s definition of price stability and, on the other, from the actual outturn. In certain cases the publication of forecasts may even destabilise expectations and price developments, in particular as the forecasts are normally conditional and reflect some of the risks and uncertainties prevailing at the time.    2. The international role of the euro   Let me now turn to the international role of the euro. The euro will be the currency of an economic area, which will roughly equal the United States in terms of both its economic strength and its degree of macroeconomic openness. However, the size of an economy and external trade volume alone are not always perfect indicators of the international importance of a currency. According to most measures, for example, the US dollar is of greater international importance than the relative size of the US economy would suggest. It is clear that the European Central Bank - which represents not only an equally large economic area with an equally large population (of 300 million), but also a currency which will increasingly circulate outside the euro area - will have an important international role to play. The international role of a currency is a complex phenomenon. There are many uses for a currency in an international context. On the official side, these include its use as an anchor for exchange rate pegs, for holding foreign exchange reserves and as a vehicle currency for foreign exchange interventions. On the private side, these include its use as a quotation and vehicle currency for international trade, as the currency of denomination for financial assets and as a substitute currency in circulation abroad. The introduction of the euro will also have consequences for economies abroad and for the international capital markets. For the euro, this means that there are several areas in which it could play a significant role. In the near future, such a role obviously seems to be more likely in areas where global currency diversification is desired, and less likely where global standardisation on the use of a single currency has occurred. In this context, it should be stressed that the euro will inherit the international role of all the currencies participating in the euro area, for instance the Deutsche Mark and the French franc. For short-term instruments, we anticipate a deep and liquid European money market, which will ensure very similar short-term interest rates for comparable instruments and credit risks. Until 1 January 1999, we will see further convergence of short-term interest rates to narrow spreads among Member States of the euro area, because of the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates, which will cause such differences to disappear within the euro area. Developments in this market segment will also be strengthened by the ESCB\\'s operational framework for open market operations, which will be based primarily on reverse transactions and the implementation of the new payment system called TARGET (the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system) in all participating countries. In this context the role of the euro vis-à-vis so-called third currencies, such as the Japanese yen and the US dollar, will receive increasing public attention. The ESCB will take a neutral stance. It will neither promote nor hinder the development of the euro as an international currency. The ESCB will accept the international role of the euro as it develops through market forces. There will be no deliberate policy of challenging third currencies. However, by being successful in maintaining price stability, the ESCB will also automatically foster the role of the euro as an international currency. We are not currently participating in a formal exchange rate arrangement with third countries outside the EU, for instance with the United States, and we consider it very likely that this situation will remain the same for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the European Ministers of Finance have agreed only to issue so-called orientations for exchange rate policy in exceptional circumstances, such as a clear and sustained misalignment of the euro. Experience of fixed exchange rates supports the view that target zones are vulnerable to speculative capital movements and could become inconsistent with the primary objective of price stability. In its monetary policy strategy, the ESCB, therefore, does not specify a target or target zones for the exchange rate of the euro. This follows from our clear mandate to maintain price stability. The exchange rate will mainly be an outcome of the economic process and of economic and monetary policies. The lack of a formal exchange rate target does not imply that the exchange rate of the euro will be unstable or volatile. Let me stress that price stability in the euro area is the best contribution the ESCB can make to a stable international monetary system and an externally stable euro. The Governing Council cannot therefore conduct an exchange rate policy separate from its monetary policy strategy. Rather, the monetary policy strategy comprises a thorough analysis of exchange rate developments. The effective exchange rate of the euro area will be a key indicator within the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ESCB. Based on its monetary strategy, the ESCB will be able to conduct a successful monetary policy, which takes into account the development of the exchange rate of the euro in an appropriate manner, as one of the determinants of price developments in the euro area.    Conclusions   The success of EMU and of the single currency will clearly depend on the establishment of a stability culture in Europe. This will facilitate the conduct of the stability-oriented monetary policy over the coming years and in particular support economic policies in achieving high international standards in terms of economic growth and employment. To the extent that the ESCB is successful in maintaining price stability, it will also foster the use of the euro as an international currency and contribute to its stability. I am convinced that the euro will follow a long European tradition of stable currencies. Its success will not come overnight. But over the coming years, stable prices in the euro area are likely to guarantee that it is widely used by Europeans and international investors.  ']\n",

This joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the Eurosystem will start Stage three of Monetary Union and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.  At the heart of our approach is the \"stability-oriented\" monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted the broad lines two months ago and presented them to the public. Today, before explaining some further details regarding the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy, I should like to describe how we interpret our mandate of maintaining price stability.   The ESCB is an institution which is independent from political interference. In a democratic society, independence has to be accompanied by accountability. The ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent if we are to convince the general public both of our commitment to maintain price stability and of our ability to do so. Therefore, we put much effort in the design of a sound and coherent framework that leads to consistent and effective monetary policy decisions.  Transparency regarding the ultimate objective of monetary policy is crucial for ensuring that the ESCB can be held accountable for its policies. The Maastricht Treaty entrusts the ESCB with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. It does not, however, quantify this objective or stipulate how it should be achieved. A clear definition in quantitative terms of price stability will help stabilise inflation expectations, build up the credibility of the single monetary policy of the ESCB and will thereby increase its effectiveness. The Governing Council of the ECB has, therefore, decided to publish a quantitative definition of price stability, with which the general public can sensibly judge its success in fulfilling the Treaty\\'s mandate.  In this context, the Governing Council agreed in October that \"price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". The HICP is a comprehensive measure for inflation, reflecting the focus of the general public on consumer goods. It is the only harmonised price index available in the euro area.  As I have emphasised in the past, the definition we have announced reflects the aversion of the Governing Council to both inflation and deflation. The phrase \"below 2%\" clearly delineates the maximum rate of inflation deemed to be consistent with price stability. The wording \"year-on-year increases \" implies that persistent price decreases - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be considered to be consistent with price stability either. We did not explicitly announce a floor for inflation, because we know that the price index may include a measurement bias of positive order, but we currently do not know its precise magnitude. One can expect, however, that the measurement bias in the HICP is smaller than for the national consumer price indices (CPIs), given the considerable effort Statisticians in the EU put in the construction of this index.  The Governing Council explicitly announced that \"price stability is to be maintained over the medium term\". In doing so, it also acknowledged that price levels may be temporarily distorted by short-term factors - for example, by changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices - which cannot be controlled by monetary policy or by the ESCB.  Using the index \"for the euro area\" highlights that area-wide developments, instead of specific national or regional factors, will be the only determinants of decisions regarding the single monetary policy. Let me emphasise the over-riding priority we attach to this objective. This priority is not only based on our legal obligations under the Treaty. It is founded in our belief - confirmed by both decades of experience and a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research - that maintaining price stability in the euro area is a pre-requisite for a sustainable and lasting improvement in the standard of living of Europe\\'s citizens.  In addition to maintaining price stability, but without prejudice to this objective, the ESCB is required to support the general economic policies in the European Community. The choice made in the Maastricht Treaty to have price stability as the primary objective of the ESCB is based on the view that this is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the creation of conditions conducive to durable income and employment growth. Indeed, price stability is one of the longer-term conditions for the achievement of other economic policy objectives, such as sustainable economic growth and full employment. By fulfilling its primary objective of maintaining price stability, the ESCB will automatically also support the general economic policies in the European Community which are aimed at achieving the aforementioned objectives, namely non-inflationary growth and high employment.   Moreover, by emphasising that price stability is to be maintained in the medium term ensures that the appropriate forward-looking and medium-term orientation is imparted to monetary policy. This will ensure that policy responses to threats to price stability are measured and deliberate. Such actions will not introduce unnecessary instability into the economy, while nevertheless ensuring that price stability is maintained.  However, it should be noted that, unless it enjoys the support of sound budgetary policies and responsible wage behaviour, the maintenance of price stability will be more difficult and thereby overall economic welfare will be reduced. That is why I attach great importance to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, in which European governments agreed to reduce government deficits to close to balance or even to create a surplus in the medium term.  In this context, it should be emphasised that the European unemployment problem is mainly of a structural nature. Monetary policy cannot solve this problem. It can only contribute to creating the conditions needed to solve the problem by maintaining price stability. The main solution to the unemployment problem has to be provided by structural reforms aimed at making European goods, services and labour markets operate more flexibly.  Let me now turn to the two main elements of the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council of the ECB has chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances existing at present as well as those in the foreseeable future. Given a natural desire to build on the success of national central banks (NCBs) in the euro area prior to Stage Three, the strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the existing strategies of NCBs. At the same time, the chosen strategy gives due consideration to the unique situation created by the transition to Monetary Union.  Given these specific circumstances, the Governing Council has decided that it would not be wise to define a single intermediate target for the ESCB\\'s monetary policy to which it would react in an almost mechanistic manner.  In accordance with the announced definition of price stability, the ESCB has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, which rests on two \"pillars\". The first pillar is a prominent role for money. This is deemed to be important on account of the basically monetary origins of inflation over the longer term. In indication of the prominent role it attaches to money in the formulation of its monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for monetary growth at its last meeting.  In parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, its strategy will also rest on a second \"pillar\". This will consist of a broadly-based assessment both of the outlook regarding price developments and of the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.  As I have just indicated, there is a wide consensus that the development of the price level is a monetary phenomenon in the medium to long term. The historical experience of central banks in- and outside Europe clearly demonstrates that it is essential, for the success of monetary policy, to carry out a thorough analysis of monetary aggregates and the information they contain. In particular, empirical evidence shows that increases in prices are relatively closely linked to rates of money growth in excess of the real growth capacity of the economy over the medium-term. Consequently, monetary developments can reveal useful information about future price developments and thereby offer an important compass for the conduct of monetary policy. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for any central bank that has the task of keeping prices stable to analyse and monitor developments of monetary aggregates closely.  It is against this background that the Governing Council decided to announce a reference value for monetary growth, which is consistent with - and serves the achievement of - price stability. The Governing Council will regularly and thoroughly analyse the relationship between actual monetary growth and this pre-announced reference value. Wherever monetary growth deviates from the reference value, an explanation will be sought. If this explanation indicates a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react accordingly in order to address this threat. However, interest rates will not be changed in a mechanistic fashion in an attempt to correct deviations of money growth from the reference value over the short term. That is why we do not speak of a target for monetary growth, but rather of a reference value.  In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB, a week ago, agreed on three important issues. First, the specific definition of a broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will be announced. Second, whether a single figure or a range will be chosen for the reference value. Third, the precise level of the first reference value for monetary growth.  In selecting the precise definition of the monetary aggregate that effectively serves the function of a reference value, both empirical and conceptual considerations were taken into account. Empirical economic studies have investigated the properties of various euro area-wide monetary aggregates, in particular in terms of their long-run stability and leading indicator properties. From the conceptual point of view it was considered of great importance to include also those assets in the monetary aggregate, which have a high degree of substitutability with narrower definitions of money. As most short-term money market instruments are close substitutes for more traditional bank deposits, it was decided to select the broadest of the available definitions. The reference value will, therefore, refer to M3 in a relatively broad definition, which includes in addition to currency in circulation and deposits also repos, money market paper, short-term debt securities issued and units or shares of money market funds.  Announcing a specific rate of monetary growth as the reference value rather than a range supports the view that the Governing Council will not react \\'mechanistically\\' to deviations from the reference value. Movements of monetary growth within a range might be interpreted as not requiring a monetary policy reaction, even when the information they reveal about the disturbance to the economy suggest a serious threat to price stability. Rather monetary policy will respond to the information revealed by the deviation so as to maintain price stability over the medium term.  Deviations of current monetary growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal risks to price stability in the medium term. To achieve this, the reference value is derived in a manner consistent with the ESCB\\'s announced definition of price stability. Furthermore, the reference value for monetary growth takes into account the trend of real GDP growth over the medium term, as well as the trend changes in the velocity of circulation. An approach using trend growth over some past period strengthens the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy strategy. At the same time, it adds some employment and income stabilising elements.  In setting the actual reference value for monetary growth, the Governing Council has taken account of these factors. First, the Governing Council is committed to maintain price stability on its published definition. This requires increases in the HICP for the euro area of \"below 2 %\". Second, the Governing Council takes the view that a figure in the range of 2 % to 2 1/2 % per annum for the trend growth of real GDP in the euro area appears to be reasonable. Third, the uncertainties concerning short-term developments in velocity linked to the start of Stage Three have led the Governing Council to assume that the medium-term trend decline in velocity lies in the approximate range of 1/2 % and 1 % each year. This range encompasses the historical experience of the last twenty years. Based on these considerations, the Governing Council decided to set the first reference value for monetary growth at 4 1/2 %.  The Governing Council of the ECB will monitor monetary developments against this reference value on the basis of latest three-month moving averages of the monthly year-on-year growth rates for M3. This will ensure that erratic monthly outturns in the data owing to data revisions do not unduly distort the information contained in the aggregate.  Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will not constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to take appropriate policy decisions. There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. This assessment will comprise a systematic analysis of all the other information on the economic and financial situation, ensuring that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when making its monetary policy decisions.  While it is true that accurate forecasts can contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy, the ESCB should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy of its internal forecasts. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability in the medium term - should be used by the public to judge the success of the ESCB\\'s policies. Consequently, publication of a forecast is only deemed important in so far as it helps to achieve price stability, through increasing the clarity and transparency of the policy-making process.  Relying on a single forecast that attempts to summarise all the information available from a wide range of indicators would be misguided. The Governing Council will not want to be presented with a single number to which it will have to react mechanistically, if at all. In contrast, the Governing Council will want to know the economic reasons behind the projected risks to price stability. The appropriate monetary policy response to a threat to price stability will depend on the nature of the threat. The Governing Council can only understand the nature of the risk if it is presented with a full set of data. From these data, it can attempt - with the help of various staff analysis - to identify the nature of the disturbance to price stability. Having identified the threat, an appropriate policy response can be selected and implemented.  The Governing Council will inform the public regularly about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area. Moreover, when policy decisions are made, the reasoning behind specific decisions - including the economic rationale on which judgements have been made - will be communicated to the public immediately after the meeting at which they have been taken. By presenting the analysis that is actually driving policy decisions, the ESCB will be transparent, since this analysis is informative about policy changes and since the presentation to the public will reflect the type of discussion I anticipate occurring in the Governing Council itself.  On the basis of the strategy I have just outlined, the Governing Council will regularly inform the public about its specific monetary policy decisions. The Governing Council will meet every fortnight. The first meeting in every month will immediately be followed by a press conference. The ECB will frequently issue press releases after meetings of the Governing Council, without delay, and will regularly publish a monthly bulletin as well as an annual report. We shall also regularly explain our policies in speeches and interviews, and I have already announced my acceptance of invitations to present them to the European Parliament at least four times a year.      Conclusions    The ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent if we are to convince the public of our commitment to maintain price stability and our ability to do so. We must be seen to be operating in a solid and coherent framework that leads to consistent and effective monetary policy decisions. Given the uncertainties that we face at the outset of Stage Three and taking into account the particular circumstances of the euro area, the chosen approach is more likely to produce good policy decisions than an almost automatic response based on specific rules defined in relation to an inflation or an intermediate monetary target. The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy adopted by the ECB Governing Council offers precisely this framework. Having respected the principle of transparency, I am confident that this strategy will be successful. By maintaining price stability in the euro area, the ESCB will then lay a necessary foundation for Europe\\'s future economic stability and prosperity.  ']\n",

In view of the prestigious nature of Euroforum, the professional standing of its President, Eduardo Bueno, Professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and consultant to the Banco de España (there is a great deal of similarity between our respective professional histories) and, above all, the value I have attached to his friendship over the past thirty years, there was no question as to whether to agree to join you for this working breakfast. I have been asked to keep my presentation brief in order to allow as much time as possible for discussion. Therefore I will try to put forward a few ideas on the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) which I can develop during subsequent discussions. During the discussion period please feel free to raise any questions on other aspects of the ECB\\'s operations.    The three fundamental principles underlying the monetary policy   As in the case of any other central bank, the ECB\\'s monetary policy is based on three fundamental principles: setting the objectives to be achieved, establishing the most appropriate strategy for accomplishing these objectives and, finally, selecting the best instruments for implementing its chosen strategy. While the Governing Council of the ECB is responsible for formulating its monetary policy, both the Executive Board of the ECB and the national central banks are involved in its application and therefore this constitutes one of the tasks allotted to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) as a whole. Objectives, strategies and instruments therefore form the three main elements which enable us to establish the precise point within the range of monetary policy possibilities which should constitute the ECB\\'s policy: its precise altitude, longitude and depth.   The ECB\\'s monetary policy objectives   We did not have to think long and hard to define the ECB\\'s monetary policy objectives and, generally speaking, those of the ESCB. This had been done for us by the Treaty on European Union in which, under Article 105, it is stated that \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\" which, on a more practical level, the ECB has defined as a year-on-year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%, which it seeks to maintain in the medium term. \"Without prejudice to the objective of price stability\", continues the aforementioned Article 105 of the Treaty, \"the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2\". If you refer to the aforementioned Article 2 of the so-called Treaty of Maastricht, you will find that sustainable and non-inflationary growth, together with a high level of employment and social protection, are among its aims. The ECB, then, must prioritise those of its activities which promote the objective of stability and, without prejudice to this approach, it will contribute, indirectly and to the extent possible, to economic growth and increased employment. Is this approach in any way contradictory? Absolutely not. The best contribution the ECB can make to promoting investment and thus to generating economic growth and increased employment is precisely by providing a framework for price stabilisation. The worst path that the ECB could follow would be to implement a lax economic policy which claimed to be directly creating jobs. In fact, in the medium term price stability will encourage efficient investment, sustainable growth and employment. This is because stability prevents price distortions, that is to say any distortion of the mechanism which guides decision-makers in the markets, and thus favours an improved allocation of resources. When stability is achieved, prices are more transparent, which promotes competition and therefore efficiency. Moreover, if economic agents have positive expectations with regard to stability, the risk premium element of long-term of interest rates will fall, promoting investment and lasting consumption. In this respect, it should be remembered that one of the clearest inflation forecast indicators is an increasingly steep maturity-related asset yield curve. Finally, stability promotes growth and employment insofar as it allows resources to be channelled into productive activity. Inflation, on the other hand, merely encourages speculative investment with the aim of safeguarding funds against monetary deterioration. As we saw earlier, the aims set out in Article 2 of the Maastricht Treaty also include social safeguards. In this context, therefore, it can be said that inflation is the most unjust of all taxes, because it attacks personal income and assets while distorting certain public redistribution mechanisms such as, for instance, progressive taxation scales. In other words, stability is not just important for economic efficiency but also for social justice, since it provides economic conditions which benefit the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. An appropriate ECB monetary policy is a necessary condition but will not, in itself, enable us to achieve stability. National taxation policies geared to satisfying the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, together with several supply-side policies leaning towards liberalisation and flexibility, are also necessary to enable us to avoid the persistent need for measures to combat inflation. We must avoid the temptation to reinterpret the Stability and Growth Pact by introducing \"golden rules\" of dubious legality, based on the false theoretical foundations of the so-called \"ultra-rationality hypothesis\" which, in the past, claimed to justify increased taxation pressure and which now calls for increased public spending in terms of investment. Let\\'s not beat about the bush: taxation policy has only one golden rule, which consists in maintaining a long-term budgetary balance on the economic horizon. In connection with the ECB\\'s objectives, it should also be noted that it is difficult or even impossible to meet two separate targets simultaneously using only a single monetary policy. This applies when dealing with the concept of fixing fluctuation bands for the rate of exchange between the euro and the US dollar. In this case, the exchange rate objective could conflict with the price stability concept and the ECB would then fail in its primary objective. We must not forget, with regard to this issue, that combining linked exchange rates, the free circulation of capital and monetary autonomy is not, to be quite blunt, sustainable. It is precisely this which is the raison d\\'être of the ECB as the single monetary authority in an economic area which has irrevocably fixed exchange rates (a single currency) and freely circulating capital (a single market). To conclude this section, let me stress that it is essential for the ECB to make it absolutely clear that its main objective is stability. If, as some would suggest (for instance in the Modigliani manifesto), the ECB were to directly target employment, this would adversely affect the credibility of its monetary policy and thus have an impact not only on inflation but also, paradoxically, on employment. The direct targeting of employment objectives by a central bank is counterproductive.   The ECB\\'s monetary policy strategy   A strategy is a combination of criteria and procedures which allow decisions to be taken in order to achieve a monetary policy objective. This decision-making process can be based on inflation forecasts which depend on the behaviour of a relevant monetary variable or, more simply, on the \"pegging\" of exchange rates to a stable currency. This last strategy is ideal for more open economies, encompassed by a specific monetary zone, such as, for instance, the Netherlands and Germany. However, this would not be suitable for a much larger but relatively closed economic space such as the euro area. I believe that it is a mistake to try to exaggerate the polarity of the inflation strategy and the monetary strategy. These are quite clearly separate strategies but they are not in any way opposed, incompatible or irreconcilable. Certainly, some aspects of each of these strategies should be combined, resulting in another, completely separate and valid strategy. This is what the ECB has done and it now needs to give the end product a name which does not merely describe the desired objective (\"the stability-orientated monetary policy strategy\"). There are two components to the ECB\\'s monetary policy strategy. The first, more practical and visible component consists in a quantitative reference to the growth of the money supply as defined by the broad M3 aggregate. Taking into account the quantitative definition of stability, economic growth and realistic hypotheses on money circulation rates, this monetary reference has initially been set at 4 1/2%. The second component of the ECB\\'s monetary strategy, a more general and enveloping one, is the estimation of inflation forecasts and risks for price stability in view of changes in a group of significant variables, all of which are related to the euro area as a whole. Some examples of these significant variables are credit, long-term interest rates, prices of raw materials, import prices, wages and public spending deficits. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. When the rate at which the money supply grows is greater than the nominal potential rate of growth of an economy, in the medium term this will generate inflation. In other words, the medium-term inflation rate is indicative of excessive monetary expansion in relation to economic growth. Growth in the money supply therefore provides the best early warning of inflation and monetary control is the best monetary policy strategy. The virtues of the first component of the ECB monetary strategy are, when all is said and done, well known. If it worked, this alone would be sufficient. In practice, however, things are never so simple. Inflation forecasting and control cannot rely solely on a monetary aggregate because of doubts as to whether or not this monetary aggregate can be controlled and is stable and meaningful. If a narrow definition of money, such as M1, is adopted, controllability can be achieved in that, through the monetary policy instrument, it is possible to have a greater impact on its evolution, but this is offset by the loss of stability and significance. If it is decided to opt for a broad monetary aggregate, such as M3 or M4, the money demand function becomes more stable and clearly more significant, in that a greater correlation can be achieved between exchange rates, providing a better explanation of changes in nominal costs and inflation, in return for some loss of control. Despite this, doubts persist. In practice, these will, of course, increase when national currencies are replaced with the euro; then the need for the second part of the monetary policy strategy will become obvious.   The ESCB monetary policy tool   The wide range of instruments available to the ESCB for the implementation of the euro area monetary policy has been established with reference to two fundamental criteria: efficiency and neutrality. These instruments can be separated into three categories, related to open market operations, standing facilities and minimum reserves. The ESCB\\'s instruments and procedures do not differ significantly from those traditionally used by the Banco de España and with which you are all familiar. This means that I only need to highlight a few differences. In addition, I should add that over recent weeks the Banco de España has introduced changes aimed at facilitating a smooth transition. With regard to open market operations, the frequency and maturity of the main re-financing operation has become that of a weekly auction of loans with a maturity of two weeks, and an interest rate which is either announced in advance (fixed rate auction) or announced later as the result of offers received (variable rate auction). There will also be monthly auctions for three-month loans which will always be of the variable rate type in order to avoid sending signals to the market. Fine-tuning will be carried out in exceptional circumstances between two regular auctions and, finally, the structural liquidity demand can be influenced by means of open market transactions which consist in the direct purchase and sale of securities or the issuance of debt certificates. Standing credit and deposit facilities will supply or absorb overnight liquidity, without the imposition of any other restrictions on their use by institutions other than the provision of guarantees or collateral. Both types of interest on standing facilities constitute a strip or corridor which will contain short-term market interest rate swings and provide a structure for monetary policy trends. This means that they will play an important role in terms of providing signals, a role also fulfilled by the Banco de España but in a less predetermined and formalised manner. As far as guarantees for all these transactions are concerned, it should be stated that acceptable collateral may take the form of either a public instrument or a private instrument, provided that these are of a suitable nature, according to the neutrality principle applied to the public sector and to the private sector. The minimum reserves will be equal to 2% of book liabilities calculated on the basis of a monthly average, will be subject to a minimum exempt level of EUR 100,000 and - this being the most important point underlining the main difference compared with the current position in Spain - will be remunerated in line with market rates. The averaging provision will allow us to absorb liquidity shocks without recourse to standing facilities. Such a minimum reserves will constitute a useful tool for restricting the volatile nature of monetary market interests rates, for reducing the need for fine-tuning and for tightening up the system\\'s liquidity, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the monetary policy. Its remuneration in line with the market will not only reduce money demand elasticity with regard to interest rates but also offer neutrality to euro area banks as compared with those in other countries which do not use such a tool.   Conclusion  Although inevitably in a simplified form, I hope that this statement on the aims, strategy and instruments of the euro area monetary policy has provided some basic information on the central core of the ECB\\'s operations and that it can be used as a starting-point for our discussions. Thank you for listening; during the discussion period, I shall be pleased to elaborate on the issues raised or examine any others which you think may be of interest.   ']\n",
      "['1998-12-03', 'Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa', 'The external value of the euro', 'Remarks by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 3rd DVFA/GMCC Dinner on 3 December 1998 in Frankfurt am Main', '  The external value of the euro   Remarks by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 3rd DVFA/GMCC Dinner on 3 December 1998 in Frankfurt am Main 1. Economic and Monetary Union will start in four weeks\\' time. On 31 December 1998 the Deutsche Mark and nine other national currencies will fade from the computer screens that thousands of foreign exchange traders have used for years to determine the course of the exchange rates for our economies, price and other economic developments, gains and losses for millions of households and firms. On 1 January 1999 the euro will be introduced legally. Three days later - on the first trading day of 1999 - the European Central Bank will conduct its first repo. A single monetary policy for eleven European countries will then start to be implemented. This enterprise has no precedent because the perimeter of the euro area embraces a number of countries that have retained their sovereignty in many crucial respects. 2. I said EMU will start in four weeks time. I could have said, however, that it has started today around 2 p.m. As you all certainly know, at that time all national central banks of the euro area have lowered their key central bank rates in a co-ordinated decision. The importance of this move cannot be overstated. It reflects, as the ECB press release of today indicates, \"a thorough discussion in the ECB\\'s Governing Council leading to a consensus on the basis of a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area\". While, as you know, future monetary policy decisions will be taken with a majority rule, this one is equivalent to a unanimous vote of the Governing Council of the ECB. It is the result of a convergence of view of all the decision making bodies of all the national central banks. It shows, to those who may have had doubts, that the primary objective of price stability is not an obstacle to a timely downward movement in the rates when it is required. Finally, and very importantly, it sets \"the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three of Monetary Union and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.\" Let me say that the final phase of the transition from eleven to one monetary policy could not have occurred in a more efficient and harmonious manner. 3. The theme of my remarks tonight is the external value of the euro, i.e. its value for the rest of the world. I shall not try to deviate from the expected substance of this theme: the place of the euro in the international monetary system, its relationship with the other key currencies. But let me start with what I regard as \"the\" answer to the question underlying the title of my speech: the external value of the euro will be primarily determined by its internal value. The guiding principle of our monetary policy will be to maintain price stability, and we -that is the members of the two key decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank (ECB) and hence of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) - firmly believe that our performance in this respect will be the key determinant of the international value of the euro.  With this in mind, the Governing Council of the ECB has recently defined the strategic aspects of the monetary policy it will follow. It has thus completed the preparatory work on the monetary policy framework which started with the selection of the instruments and procedures. Since this was done just two days ago and is pertinent to the theme of my speech tonight, let me spend a few words on it before going to the heart of my subject. 4. In communicating our monetary policy strategy to the public, we have done our best to ensure maximum clarity and transparency. While for any central bank clarity and transparency are vital to establish credibility and ensure the success of its policy actions, this is particularly true for a new-born central bank such as the ECB.  Designing a monetary policy strategy for the ECB has not been easy because Economic and Monetary Union is likely to prompt profound changes in economic and financial behaviour in the euro area. Inevitably, these changes create a special uncertainty, and our efforts to predict them cannot be expected to be entirely successful. The ECB therefore had to adopt a strategy that reflects the special features of the shift to a new monetary regime. The three main elements of the strategy should be recalled.  First, we have formally defined the primary objective assigned by the Treaty, namely price stability. For the ESCB - as was decided in October - price stability means a year-on-year increase in prices for the euro area as a whole of less than 2%. Let me explain. First, this definition acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the so-called measurement bias. Second, it emphasises that the single monetary policy cannot be used to solve regional or national problems; it will apply to the entire euro area, just as the Deutsche Bundesbank\\'s policy has so far applied to the whole Bundesrepublik. And, third, the word \"increase\" implies that both persistent inflation and deflation are incompatible with our definition of price stability. Price stability is to be maintained in the medium term. The second element of the strategy is the prominent role given to money. This has been reflected in the adoption by the Governing Council, the day before yesterday, of a reference value of 4 1/2% for the growth of M3. The reference value will be revised annually. It should be emphasised that the ECB did not wish to lock itself into a monetary target. Given the uncertain environment, this would have been simply too risky. Thus, while deviations from the reference value would normally signal risks to price stability, there is no commitment to mechanically correct deviations whenever they may arise. The ECB, through its President and the other members of the Governing Council, will of course regularly explain to the public how its interpretation of the actual behaviour of money relative to the reference value has affected its policy decisions. The third element is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments that includes an analysis of an array of economic and financial indicators other than money. Here again, we shall regularly explain to the public the impact that this analysis has had on our decisions to change, or not to change, interest rates. We are confident that this strategy will maintain price stability in the euro area, thereby preserving the internal value of the new currency. This will also satisfy the key condition for the euro to play a positive role internationally. 5. Let now me come to the core of the subject. And I begin by noting that, given the sheer size of the future euro area, any reflection about the external value of the euro is also a reflection about exchange rate relationships at the global level.  6. The introduction of the euro, unique as it may be for Europe, will not, by itself, modify the exchange rate regime in which the world is living at present. This is a regime of floating exchange rates and is the outcome of developments that have occurred over thirty or forty years: a greater balance in the relative economic size of the leading countries, the tendency of economic policies to pursue primarily domestic objectives, the liberalisation of capital movements, the growing role of markets, the deregulation of domestic markets and, last but not least, the spectacular advances in technology. These developments have fundamentally affected the ability of the monetary authorities to control exchange rates on which the Bretton Woods system had been built. A highly integrated world financial system has taken over from official authorities the role of both exchange rate determination and the international allocation of capital. As is shown by its most recent crisis, this system has also acquired the capability to rapidly transmit the consequences of errors in private investments and public policies throughout the world.  7. The priority assigned by the large countries and currency areas to domestic objectives explains why in recent years policy co-ordination at the global level has been essentially of a non-binding nature. This has not precluded occasional active co-operation between the three main currency areas. Co-ordinated action to stabilise world exchange rates was agreed, for example, by the major industrialised countries at the Plaza meeting in September 1985 to halt the appreciation of the US dollar, and with the Louvre Accord of February 1987 to prevent its undesired depreciation. However, large countries have always refrained from committing themselves to formal exchange rate arrangements or pre-defined rules for their management. My expectation is that the introduction of the euro will not change this attitude. 8. The present international financial system is indeed a \"fact of life\". This does not mean that it is the best of all worlds. The Mexican financial breakdown in late 1994 and, in the last fifteen months, the crisis in East Asia and the spread of the ensuing turmoil to Russia and, to some degree, to eastern Europe and Latin America later on, have raised legitimate questions about the inherent stability of the present system. Earlier, in the 1990s, Europe had experienced a currency crisis of its own. Huge pressure was brought to bear indiscriminately on various currencies participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Today, it is recognised that the main underlying cause of the near-breakdown of the arrangement in the summer of 1993 was what academics call a \"co-ordination failure\", including uncompromising priority given to domestic objectives on the part of national authorities. In a fully liberalised financial world, market participants exploited in full the possibility of making profits out of the co-ordination failure.  9. The European currency crisis provided a striking confirmation of the well-known proposition that free trade, complete freedom of capital movements, fixed exchange rates and autonomous national monetary policies cannot coexist for very long. The four elements constitute what I have called on other occasions an \"inconsistent quartet\". And I do think that the inconsistent quartet constitutes a most useful paradigm to understand international economic and monetary relationships both at the European and at the global level. Europe has now reconciled the inconsistent quartet by moving from autonomous national monetary policies to monetary union. I have long been convinced that for our countries this was the only way to preserve unrestricted trade and the freedom of capital movements. Monetary union has not only been an act of political will; it has also been the recognition that, in a region that has achieved an unprecedented degree of economic and financial integration, destabilising capital flows could destroy the single market and hence a primary source of our prosperity. At the global level, it is the third element of the inconsistent quartet -fixed exchange rates -which has been given away, and this happened 25 years ago. Like Europe, the world cannot do without free trade and high capital mobility. Unlike Europe, it has neither the possibility nor the willingness to bind monetary policies to an objective of exchange rate stability. As I have just said, when the increase in capital mobility generated the dilemma, domestic objectives took precedence over external ones. 10. The rather compelling logic of the inconsistent quartet does not mean, however, that exchange rate stability world-wide is not desirable. In my view, it is. Indeed, abrupt changes in exchange rates may generate calls for protectionism and restrictions on capital flows that would eventually erode free trade and hence economic efficiency and prosperity. Very few would claim that these outcomes are desirable.  11. While recognising that stable exchange rates are desirable not only for Europe but also elsewhere, I largely concur with those who have expressed serious doubts about the idea of setting ranges for the fluctuations of the major currencies. Even if one disregards, for a moment, the inconsistent quartet and the potential conflict with domestic price stability (something one should, of course, not do), I see three specific difficulties in establishing such ranges.  First, the participants in the system would need to agree on mutually consistent values for the central rate of the target ranges, both in nominal and in real terms. This, in turn, means that they would have to agree on the resulting pattern of current account deficits or surpluses. Clearly, this is not just a technical matter, since the presence of a large US current account deficit, a legacy of the 1980s that is not likely to disappear soon, makes an agreement on exchange rates difficult to achieve. If a long-term agreement on exchange rates were negotiated, exporters both in Europe and in the United States would be likely to press their respective authorities to obtain a \"favourable\" rate of exchange for their currency. The current account situation of the United States would be a powerful argument for US exporters to convince their authorities that a substantial depreciation of the dollar would be desirable - and hence an appreciation of the euro and the Japanese yen. Of course, this would be resisted in Europe and Japan. An agreement could thus prove impossible, and this could even strengthen protectionist pressures on both sides of the Atlantic. Second, a major shift in the monetary regime of an area as large as Europe would make it difficult to estimate equilibrium exchange rates for the three major currencies. Estimating equilibrium rates is a very complex exercise under any circumstances. Today, such an effort would be virtually impossible, given that we simply do not have a historical record of the determinants of the external value of the new European currency. Even a qualitative assessment of how the euro will tend to move, compared with its predecessor European currencies, would be very difficult. The recent debate on the possible role of the euro as an international reserve currency shows the extent of the disagreement amongst economists on whether this role will expand or shrink compared with the role played hitherto by the Deutsche Mark, and whether the euro will depreciate or appreciate as a result. Third, and to my mind most decisively, the so-called target zones are subject to the same inherent fragility that affects all \"adjustable peg\" systems and that ultimately caused the end of the Bretton Woods regime and the virtual suspension of the ERM. This is the risk of being destabilised by market forces, due to the well-known difficulties in agreeing on timely changes in the reference values required by changes in economic fundamentals. Thus, while world-wide exchange rate stability is desirable, a system that tries to enforce it mechanically may just not be practicable. 12. Against the background of the inconsistent quartet theory and in the light of the difficulties entailed in a return to formal agreements on exchange rate management, one may wonder what is the key to stable international monetary relationships. As long as we live in a world of sovereign States, the core answer to this question is: sound domestic policies and sound institutions. If the two pillars of sound policies and sound institutions were firmly established, then the task left to international policy co-ordination would not be disproportionate. Let me say a few more words about these two pillars. 13. Sound economic policies. The relationship between domestic policies and the external value of a currency was vividly illustrated by the behaviour of the US dollar in the early 1980s. Between 1982 and 1985, international capital flowed into the United States in large amounts as a consequence of the opening-up of a large and chronic budget deficit. The scale of the inflows was so large that it drove up the dollar to a level which exacerbated the current account deficit. The massive overvaluation of the dollar was a spectacular example of the tendency of foreign exchange markets, with floating exchange rates and mobile capital, to generate wide and prolonged misalignments in exchange rates. This was not the result of a market imperfection, however. On the contrary, markets behaved just like any macroeconomic textbook would have predicted. The overvaluation of the dollar occurred in parallel with a massive fiscal expansion and the monetary policy tightening that responded to it: an \"unbalanced policy mix\", as economists call it. 14. We should not forget that episode, because also for the euro area the policy mix will be a major determinant of the external value of the new currency. Today, prices in the euro area are stable, interest rates - whether short or long, nominal or real - are at historically low levels, and economic growth is supported by the stance of monetary policy. There is a similar situation in the United States. A scenario like the one that occurred in the United States in the early 1980s does not seem likely to develop in Europe or in the United States in the current circumstances.  The situation, however, would change if the currently perceived risks of fiscal relaxation in Europe were to materialise. The European policy mix might then become unbalanced, and market developments could adversely affect long-term interest rates and theexchange rate. These risks should be considered carefully when assessing the stance of fiscal policies. Reducing deficit and debt levels must therefore remain the objective of European governments, in particular where the public debt is large. This is a pre-condition for a balanced policy mix, one that will keep interest rates low and make the euro a stable currency. You may say that this is the traditional central banker\\'s argument. Yes, it is; but that does not mean that it is not valid. 15. Sound institutions. Until recently, abundant capital had flowed into emerging countries, which were eventually unable to handle inflows of such a magnitude, partly because of a mismanagement of external liabilities, weak domestic banking systems and insufficiently sound institutional architecture. When capital left these countries, it did it so very quickly, causing a major currency (and banking) crisis, with severe damage to the economies concerned. I do not believe that globalisation per se was the cause of the crisis, although some aspects of it - such as information technology, financial innovation and the easy flow of capital across borders - may have contributed. The problem is that the development of a global financial market and the rise of the emerging economies have not been accompanied by the parallel improvement in the legal and regulatory infrastructure that is always needed, both nationally and internationally, for markets to function properly and to be reasonably stable. The current crisis is, to a large extent, the result of such an imbalance. 16. The Asian crisis has thus been just another reminder that, at the end of the day, the issue underlying the stability of currencies is the set of policies that engender (or endanger) stability. Sound policies and institutions cannot be \"replaced\", so to speak, by a link between the domestic currency and another currency. There is nothing wrong with such a linkage (and I even think that currency boards may be an appropriate solution for certain countries), but the currency must be tied at a competitive level and, most importantly, must be backed by sound domestic fundamentals. What has been true for the long-term participants in the international financial system also applies to those who have joined the system more recently, and will apply to future newcomers.  17. My insistence on the role of sound domestic policies and sound institutions does not imply that international arrangements and multilateral organisations have no role to play in the future. In a global economy made up of about 200 sovereign States, multilateral arrangements integrate the policy architecture by providing the incentives to improve national institutions and policies. They should be strengthened, not undermined. To this end, a number of initiatives are under way that, if implemented successfully, could significantly improve international discipline. These concern such areas as transparency, accountability, practices for supervision, payment and settlement systems, accounting standards and disclosure. International standards should be agreed and applied broadly.  18. It\\'s time for me to conclude. The revival of a discussion about the international monetary system is in part the consequence of a series of turbulences that started - just after the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions - with the Mexican crisis of 1994, and went on last year and this year with the Asian crisis. A serious debate, with proposals, has now started on the ways and means to promote sound macroeconomic management, sound institution building and a more efficient working of financial markets. Our aim should be to maximise the benefits to be derived from globalisation without having to suffer from its tendency to spread instability. I am persuaded that the creation of the euro, with its profound implications for political and economic life in Europe, will give impetus to this renewed thinking, and that it will provide the world with a striking example of how far sovereign nations can push their co-operative spirit. It will also bring to the international fora a new voice, strongly imbued with that same spirit. Tonight I have shared with you my conviction that sound economic policies and strong institutions are, today as in the past, the key factor in achieving stability in international economic, financial and monetary relationships. They are, therefore, the key to establishing and preserving the external value of the euro. You can be sure that our work, at the ECB, is - and will continue to be - guided by these principles.

      "['1998-12-03', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The role of monetary policy in economic policy', 'Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities Brussels, 3 December 1998', '  The role of monetary policy in economic policy   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities Brussels, 3 December 1998 Ladies and gentlemen, in less than one month\\'s time Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will start and the euro will be launched. This event will have wide-reaching implications for the orientation of economic policy in the euro area. Moreover, the creation of a single currency is also likely to have a significant effect on the role of Europe in the international economy. As with any fundamental change, the start of Stage Three will be characterised by considerable uncertainty and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will not have an established track record. Therefore, it is particularly important to explain to the public as clearly as possible both our objective of price stability and the framework or monetary policy strategy that we shall use to achieve our main goal. I shall consider the role of monetary policy in economic policy in this context.   The ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy   The Treaty establishing the European Community (the \"Treaty\") assigns to the ESCB the overriding objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. This mandate reflects the conviction that price stability is a key condition for creating a stability-oriented environment which is beneficial to economic activity, employment and, more generally, to the welfare of society, thereby contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community. As you will be aware, the Treaty also stipulates that the ESCB shall be independent in the performance of its tasks and duties. The reason for including this provision in the Treaty is that an independent central bank may be more effective in the pursuit of price stability - which is, in essence, a long-run commitment - without being pressured by the political authorities to achieve short-run objectives. In a democratic society, this gives rise to special requirements in terms of accountability and transparency, which are issues to which I shall return presently. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has carefully considered how these requirements could be fulfilled most effectively. One of the key results of these deliberations was the recent decision to announce a quantitative definition of price stability by which the ESCB\\'s performance can be easily assessed by the public. Price stability was therefore specified as a \"year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". The term \"increase\", in particular, implies that a situation of deflation - i.e. a sustained and ongoing decline in the consumer price level - is not consistent with price stability. Price stability is a medium-term concept. The ESCB will not smooth any short-term deviations in price developments from this quantitative perspective. As monetary policy measures affect the economy with long and unpredictable time lags, it is not feasible for central banks to control prices in the short run. Moreover, the benefits of price stability pertain more to the long-run development of the price index than to its short-term fluctuations. In addition to the definition of price stability, the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB consists of two key elements. As a first pillar, the Governing Council attributed a \"prominent role\" to money, as the empirical evidence suggests that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon in the long run. For this reason, the Governing Council decided to announce a reference value for money growth. The first reference value was recently determined at 4.5% and refers to the broad monetary aggregate M3. This should allow for an adequate provision of money to the economy at a rate consistent with the achievement of sustainable non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area. The choice of this reference value was also determined by reasons other than the empirical relationship between broad money growth and inflation in the euro area. Money growth will provide a reference value for assessing the monetary policy stance. Indeed, money can help the general public to understand correctly what monetary policy can and cannot do, thereby enhancing the central bank\\'s transparency and accountability. While money will have a prominent role, it will not be the sole and automatic guide for the monetary policy of the ESCB. Especially at the start of Stage Three, when significant and mostly unpredictable changes are likely to occur in the economic, monetary and financial environment, there will be a need to monitor a wide range of indicators. For example, the changeover to Stage Three may lead members of the public to adjust their investment portfolios and this could make the behaviour of monetary aggregates more difficult to explain. Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding future price-setting behaviour in the euro area, especially in those Member States with more limited experience of price stability. This might also blur the relationship between money and prices. The evaluation of the economic and financial indicators that will be monitored will be based exclusively on their expected influence on future price developments. For instance, the ESCB will follow closely long-term interest rates, confidence indicators, output measures, the behaviour of wages, the price of commodities and also the external value of the euro insofar as it affects prices in the euro area.    The benefits of price stability   I should now like to elaborate a little on the benefits of price stability, before moving on to the role of monetary policy in economic policy. I have already highlighted the importance of price stability in shaping a stability-oriented macroeconomic context in the euro area. Indeed, the empirical evidence suggests that price developments are more predictable when the inflation rate is low; price stability thus enhances the predictability of the macroeconomic environment. A situation of low inflation also allows households and firms to base their economic decisions on more reliable information, as they may find it easier to distinguish movements in relative prices from movements in the general price index. Both of these aspects of price stability lead ultimately to a more efficient allocation of resources, which is of vital importance for the economic welfare of society in the long run. For instance, firms may engage in long-term investments without fearing that an unexpected surge or decline in the inflation rate could cause their commitment to be sub-optimal or even unsustainable. In the same vein, households may plan an optimal allocation of saving and consumption over their lifetime, without facing the risk of the real value of financial assets changing on account of an unexpected rise or decline in the inflation rate. This enables financial markets to function more smoothly and perform more effectively their basic function of channelling funds to their most productive use. One particular benefit to be derived from a stable price environment is that borrowers are not requested to pay extra, to cover the risk of an unexpected rise in the general price level. As a consequence, real interest rates, i.e. interest rates corrected for expected inflation, will be lower, thereby encouraging people to commit more resources to productive activities. A situation of price stability also avoids the risk of borrowers being confronted with a rising real value of financial debts, which are normally fixed in advance in nominal terms, in the event of an unexpected and persistent decline in prices. Such a rising real debt burden may have negative effects on real economic activity, as borrowers are normally more engaged in productive activities than lenders. High inflation or persistent deflation is costly for society even in the best possible scenario, i.e. when it is perfectly anticipated. The need to take price level changes into account in every kind of nominal contract is so universal that extensive resources are ultimately diverted from alternative and more productive uses. For example, at times of high inflation sellers must continuously update menus and households expend needless time and energy when they are forced to economise on liquid balances. Moreover, if the tax system is not completely indexed to changes in the price index, which is very often the case, inflation does in the end have real redistribution effects, which, in practice, entails an automatic increase in the tax burden. Finally, I should like to emphasise the fact that price stability is particularly beneficial for the political cohesion of society, because inflation (but also deflation) brings about an undemocratic redistribution of economic resources. Experience has shown that, as a rule, this hits the weakest members of society the hardest, because, for example, they maintain a higher proportion of their wealth in liquid assets.   What the monetary policy of the ESCB can do   The Treaty states that the ESCB, while having price stability as a primary objective, shall support the general economic policies in the European Community; moreover, it will operate in a such a way as to be consistent with the establishment of free and competitive markets. The Treaty therefore provides an explicit order of priority for the objectives: price stability is the first reference point for the monetary policy of the ESCB, and only within the limits of price stability can there be scope to contribute to the achievement of the other objectives of the European Community. As a consequence, the role of other Community objectives in the monetary policy of the ESCB is conditional upon the achievement of the overriding target of price stability. The high unemployment rate in Europe represents the main concern of economic policy-makers. I should like to stress that the ESCB shares these concerns and will do its utmost to help find a solution to this problem. That said, however, we should realise that what monetary policy is able to contribute to economic policy and the reduction of unemployment, is the achievement of price stability. I have already explained the benefits of price stability for society and the reasons which underlie this conviction in some detail. By creating optimal conditions for a sustainable and strong pace of economic activity, price stability will ultimately spur employment growth and foster higher living standards. Moreover, in specific circumstances, if production, inflation and employment all move in the same direction, monetary policy can play a role in stabilising output and employment growth, without endangering price stability. However, this role is very limited, because the high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the consequence of structural rigidities within the European labour and product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments. The solution is thus to be found, above all, in structural reforms. The European unemployment rate has, indeed, been high and stable over the business cycles in the past decade. However, over the same period, unemployment was significantly reduced in those EU countries which succeeded in creating better-functioning labour and product markets, which allowed wages and prices to adjust when economic conditions changed. A clear example can be found in the Netherlands, where a substantial reduction in unemployment has been effected in recent years by reforming the labour market, while following the same monetary policy as Germany, where the unemployment rate is still close to 10%. The ESCB is also concerned with the variability of real output and the associated fluctuations in employment, which could be considered to be an undesired consequence of an excessive control of price developments. In this respect, the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy of the ESCB should help to avoid excessive fluctuations in real economic activity. Given the fact that the ESCB does not aim to stabilise every short-term deviation of price developments from the predetermined path of price stability, it contributes to the stabilisation of economic activity around its long-run potential growth path. I should like to add, however, that the room for manoeuvre of monetary policy and the degree of success in terms of maintaining price stability crucially depend on the support of sound fiscal policies and responsible wage settlements in the euro area.   The links with other economic policies   I should now like to address the way in which the economic environment and the economic policies of both the Community and the governments of Member States will affect the functioning of monetary policy. A monetary policy reaction to inflationary pressures and the uprooting of inflationary expectations may cause short-run fluctuations in real output. Flexible and competitive goods and labour markets, however, would soften this trade-off, thereby allowing central banks to attain the goal of price stability with less serious adverse consequences for real output. The establishment of free and competitive markets for labour, goods and services would facilitate to a large extent the functioning of monetary policy in the euro area. At the limit, it is conceivable that if markets were to operate without friction, the control of inflation by a central bank could be exercised with a negligible impact on real output. Market flexibility may also help to reduce regional asymmetries in the effects of the single monetary policy. The monetary policy of the ESCB will be geared towards the euro area as a whole and will not be able to take into account purely national or regional developments. Moreover, the cyclical positions of participating countries will not completely converge at the start of Stage Three, although, with the single currency in place, some national differences may disappear over time. In the past, asymmetric shocks across European countries were sometimes dealt with via movements in the exchange rates. In the EMU environment, which is characterised by a single and uniform monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole, the required adjustments will have to stem from fiscal policies and national prices and wages, in addition to mobility of labour and capital. For this reason, the ESCB will follow closely, and contribute to, the debate on the reform of European wage-setting mechanisms. Sound economic reasoning recommends that wages should reflect the differentials in productivity; otherwise inflation and unemployment could result. Budgetary policies also play a major role in conditioning monetary policy. Sound budgetary policies enhance the credibility of monetary policy by preventing inflationary pressures due to an excessive stimulation of domestic demand. Furthermore, fiscal discipline exerts a downward influence on the risk premia embedded in nominal long-term interest rates. Moreover, given the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, a budgetary position which is close to balance or in surplus in normal conditions may allow scope for reaction to unforeseen regional or local shocks that could bring about heavy real output losses. This would also contribute to alleviating the possible asymmetric impact of monetary policy actions on single countries.    Accountability and transparency of the monetary policy of the ESCB   Allow me now to return to the issues of democratic accountability and transparency. The Treaty contains several provisions which ensure the accountability of the ESCB. First, it states that the ECB is required to disclose to the European Community institutions (the Council of the European Union, the European Commission and the European Parliament) an annual report on the ESCB\\'s monetary policy. Moreover, as President of the ECB, I am required to present the report to the European Parliament and to take part in the subsequent debate. As I have announced before, I shall attend the hearings at the European Parliament at least four times per year to discuss the activities of the ESCB. The Parliament has the right to ask the members of the Executive Board to provide answers to specific questions. Finally, representatives of the European Commission and of the ECOFIN Council participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and thus monitor the preparation of monetary policy decisions. Broadly speaking, the issue of the transparency of monetary policy is very important at the start of Stage Three, given that the ESCB is a new institution and the public is not accustomed to evaluating its behaviour. The monetary policy of the ESCB will be transparent in fulfilling its overriding objective of maintaining price stability, as stated explicitly in the mandate of the Treaty; it will also be held accountable in reaching its main goal. The ESCB has also gone beyond the Treaty requirements. Since the summer, a routine of holding a monthly press conference has been established, in which I and the Vice-President of the ECB report on the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and disclose and explain the underlying arguments. My introductory statements at these press conferences are and will continue to be published without delay. Moreover, as from January 1999 the ECB will provide the public with a Monthly Bulletin containing a detailed analysis of the economic situation that led to the monetary policy decisions. Furthermore, my colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and myself intend to be very active in giving speeches which deal with all issues of relevance for the conduct of monetary policy. I am convinced that the Governors of the national central banks will be glad to perform the same role for national audiences. Furthermore, the publication of working and occasional paper series will further clarify the \"economic model\" that underpins the ESCB\\'s reasoning and behaviour and stimulate the debate on relevant technical and policy issues. I should also like to emphasise that the ESCB does not see communication as a one-way street. On the contrary, I think that we would greatly benefit from a frequent exchange of opinions and ideas with social partners and the public at large.   Relationship with other European Community institutions   The relationship between the ESCB and other European institutions is explicitly mentioned in the Treaty. There is considerable scope for collaboration and exchange of views with other European institutions. However, the ESCB is independent in its pursuit of price stability. I have already mentioned my reports to the European Parliament, which represent an example of the democratic accountability of monetary policy. Furthermore, as President of the ECB, I shall be invited to the ECOFIN Council meetings whenever issues of relevance to the ESCB come under discussion. As I mentioned earlier the President of the ECOFIN-Council and a member of the Commission may participate, without having the right to vote, in meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB. Finally, I should like to mention that I am also invited to the newly established informal Euro-11 Council meetings.   Conclusion   The main contribution of EMU to the welfare of the people will be the maintenance of price stability. Our conviction and hope is that the economic performance of the euro area will benefit significantly from price stability. This will also ultimately facilitate the achievement of the objectives which underpin the general economic policies of the European Community and the individual governments at the national level. Moreover, both the support of the social partners and the adoption of behaviour consistent with the maintenance of price stability are of extreme importance to a successful start of EMU.  ']\n",
      "['1998-12-01', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Introductory statement with Q&A', 'Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank', '  ECB Press conference: Introductory statement   Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today\\'s meetings of the Governing Council and the General Council of the European Central Bank. Similarly to last month, the Governing Council had a very heavy agenda with many of the items being of a rather technical nature or related to the legal implementation of decisions already taken at previous meetings.  Let me first turn to the Governing Council\\'s in-depth discussion on recent economic,  monetary and financial developments.   Today the Governing Council focused, inter alia, on various projections available for the world economy and the euro area. This material pointed unequivocally to some deceleration of real GDP growth in the euro area in 1999, compared with the widely expected growth rate of just below 3% in 1998.  In addition, the Governing Council took note of the apparently calmer conditions in world financial markets in November this year. A key feature has been the diminished volatility in financial markets.  However, the Governing Council pointed out that caution is warranted when interpreting the most recent developments and the projections available. Indeed, downward risks continue to exist.  In the view of the Governing Council, apart from global developments, the most significant risk for all forecasts is that confidence within the euro area and thereby domestic demand could be negatively affected. Confidence in the corporate sector has already declined. In this respect, the Governing Council emphasised the utmost importance of maintaining a sound and sustainable policy framework within the euro area, particularly in the interest of supporting confidence. This framework is characterised by the maintenance of a stability-oriented monetary policy, a conduct of fiscal policies which is consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact, and ongoing structural reforms in the labour and product markets, accompanied by continued wage moderation. Maintaining this policy framework will help to foster competitiveness and profitability in the corporate sector, thereby promoting investment. Equally, it will help to sustain and foster the employment growth that has been seen recently, thereby supporting private consumption.  Against this background, the Governing Council discussed in depth issues related to the conduct of monetary policy for the euro area. Let me elaborate on that discussion, which further prepared the ground for the setting of interest rates for the euro area. In the context of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the main elements of which were announced in October this year, the Governing Council agreed on the quantitative reference value for monetary growth and the monetary aggregate to which it applies. Moreover, the Governing Council carefully analysed the data on monetary developments and made a thorough examination of the broad outlook for price stability.  The first reference value for monetary growth decided by the Governing Council, which plays a prominent role in the Governing Council\\'s monetary policy assessment, will apply to the broad monetary aggregate M3 and has been set at an annual rate of 4 1/2%; it will be reviewed in December 1999. This rate is consistent with the maintenance of price stability according to the ESCB\\'s published definition, while allowing for sustainable output growth. It has been derived by assuming that the trend growth rate of real GDP in the euro area is in the range of 2% to 2 1/2% per annum and the velocity of circulation of M3 declines at a trend rate of between 1/2% and 1% each year. Further details related to the derivation of the reference rate and the definition of the broad aggregate M3 are described in a separate press statement to be released today. With regard to the reference value, let me stress two points very clearly.  First, the reference value for M3 growth has been derived in an explicit medium-term context, in line with the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy. Analysis of monetary developments relative to the reference value will provide a firm anchor for the conduct of the stability-oriented single monetary policy.  Second, the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy does not entail \"mechanistic\" policy reactions to deviations of monetary growth from the announced reference value. In the first instance, deviations of monetary growth will be analysed thoroughly, in parallel with the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments.  Preliminary estimates for part of the euro area indicate that the average of the 12-month growth rates for the last three months (including October) was around 4.5%. Taking a medium-term perspective, the Governing Council took note of the fact that over the last two years the annual rate of M3 growth has constantly fluctuated in a range of 3.5% to 5.5%. It was concluded that this monetary trend appears to be broadly compatible with continued price stability in the euro area. In line with the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council will closely monitor developments in M3 in relation to the reference value.  As regards other financial indicators, average long-term interest rates in the euro area declined slightly in November to 4.15%. The decline in long-term interest rates, which has been substantial since June this year, is consistent with the view that markets currently have low inflation expectations.  The discussion on the appropriate interest rates for the start of Stage Three was further deepened during the deliberations of the members of the Governing Council on the broad outlook for price stability in the euro area. Prospects for price developments are generally seen as favourable as the rate of increase in the HICP, which stood at 1.0% in October, is expected to remain below 2% in the foreseeable future. However, this is conditional on import prices remaining subdued and wage developments continuing to be moderate.  In the same context, the Governing Council emphasised once again that budgetary positions are still far from being close to balance or in surplus, while debt ratios are still at a very high level. All the members of the Governing Council agreed that any tendency to relax the fiscal stance or to alter the strategy enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact would risk endangering the credibility of the euro and the objective of price stability.  On balance, the outlook for price stability was judged favourably by the Governing Council. In an environment of substantial uncertainty, monetary policy will be guided by a continuous convergence of central bank interest rates towards the level considered to be appropriate for the monetary, financial and economic situation prevailing at the start of Stage Three.  Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary  Union    (1) Revision of the key for the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB)   Revised GDP data, which are used to calculate the key for the capital of the European Central Bank, have been received from the Commission of the European Communities. When the revisions are applied to the calculation of the capital key, variations of more than 0.01% occur. Article 2 of the original Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 9 June 1998 (ECB/1998/1) states that should revisions received before December 1998 result in variations of this magnitude, the key for the capital of the ECB may be revised. The General Council and the Governing Council have therefore considered and agreed to an adjustment of the key and the Governing Council has adopted the related ECB Decision.  Details of the adjusted shares of the national central banks (NCBs) are presented in a separate press release which is to be issued this evening.  Today, also in this connection, the General Council adopted an ECB Decision on the contribution of the non-euro area national central banks to the capital of the ECB, for which the adjustment of the key has knock-on implications. The Decision states that the non-euro area NCBs will pay up 5% of their subscriptions to the capital of the ECB. However, the four NCBs concerned will not actually be asked to pay their share since the amounts due are less than they can expect to receive as their share in the proceeds of the liquidation of the European Monetary Institute. These details were already agreed by the General Council at its meeting on 1 September this year and are now contained in a legally binding text.   (2)  National legal framework for the monetary policy instruments and procedures in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary  Union   As you are already aware, from January 1999, the single monetary policy will be defined and implemented by the decision-making bodies of the ECB, the Governing Council and the Executive Board. The operations of the monetary policy of the ESCB will be carried out in a decentralised manner by the participating NCBs. Therefore, the NCBs have prepared contractual and/or regulatory legal documentation (the national legal documentation) in order to implement the monetary policy framework of the ESCB as adopted by the Governing Council on 11 September 1998 and published in the report entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\".  The national legal documentation of each NCB has been assessed by legal experts from the NCBs and the ECB in order to ensure that it properly implements and complies with the monetary policy framework of the ESCB, which aims at establishing a level playing- field across the euro area. All eligible institutions wishing to access monetary policy operations and standing facilities in Stage Three should therefore contact their local NCB in order to prepare for the execution of that national legal documentation in good time before the beginning of Stage Three.   (3)  Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves   Today the Governing Council adopted the Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves. The final specifications of the minimum reserve system to be used by the ESCB in Stage Three was the subject of a press release following the Governing Council meeting on 13 October this year. At that time it was announced that an ECB Regulation on minimum reserves would be published shortly thereafter. This commitment has now been fulfilled and the features of the ESCB\\'s minimum reserve system are contained in a legally binding text.  Further details of this matter are contained in a separate press release, which will be issued to you this evening.   (4)  Regulation of the European Central Bank concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector   Today the Governing Council also adopted an ECB Regulation concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) sector. The purpose of this Regulation is to enable the ECB and the NCBs to collect the statistical material required for the establishment of the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector. The aim of this balance sheet is to provide the ECB with a comprehensive, statistical picture of monetary developments covering the aggregated financial assets and liabilities of MFIs located in the euro area.   (5)  Payments systems issues    (i) Legal documentation for the correspondent central banking model (CCBM)   The correspondent central banking model (CCBM) is a system which will enable all collateral that is eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations to be used on a cross-border basis. It is a system that relies on bilateral relations between the NCBs involved and implies, inter alia, a regime of rights and liabilities between the NCBs.  There are two pieces of legal documentation involved in this issue. First, there is the so called \"CCBM Main Agreement\", which concerns the participating Member States and the ECBs, and second, there is what we call the \"Out CCBM Agreement\", which deals with the regulations for operations concerning non-participating Member States.  Today, the central bank Governors of all 15 Member States and the President of the ECB signed the \"Out CCBM Agreement\" and the members of the Euro system signed the \"CCBM Main Agreement\", \"Eurosystem\" being the term which we now intend to use to refer to the 11 euro area NCBs and the ECB. Further details of the CCBM and information concerning the forthcoming publication of a brochure on the subject are contained in a separate press release which will be issued to you this evening.   (ii) TARGET Agreement   Further to the Governing Council\\'s agreement on the main features of the legal framework for TARGET in November this year, I am pleased to be able to inform you that today the TARGET Agreement has been signed by all 15 central bank Governors and the President of the ECB, thus allowing the non-euro area NCBs to be connected to TARGET. By entering into the TARGET Agreement today, the central banks of Denmark , Greece , Sweden and the United Kingdom have consequently agreed to adhere to the rules and procedures referred to in the TARGET Guideline, which regulates the relationship between the ECB and all euro area central banks. Finally, it gives me pleasure to announce that the central bank Governors of these four countries have committed their NCBs to adhere to the principles laid down in the policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euro area, which was released to you on 3 November 1998 .   (6) Issues relating to accounting and financial reporting   Finally, today the Governing Council, having considered the observations of the General Council, adopted an ECB Guideline on the legal framework for accounting and reporting in the ESCB. This Guideline will not be published but will be available on request from the ECB.  A number of other decisions were also taken regarding the consolidated weekly financial statement of the ESCB. The formats for the external reporting of the financial accounts of the ESCB were agreed. It was decided that Friday will be the reporting date of the ESCB and that publication of the weekly consolidated balance sheet will take place on the following Tuesday. Further information on the accounting principles and techniques involved will be made available before the end of 1998, when the first consolidated balance sheet is to be published.       Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB     Question: President Duisenberg, I have a question with respect to point 5 in your statement that says that you decided on a reference rate rather than on a range, and the reason you gave was that the Council believes that announcing a reference range might be falsely interpreted by the public as implying that interest rates would be changed automatically. On the other hand, you said that deviations from this reference rate will not be followed mechanistically by you. And I do not quite see why this should not also apply to a range?  Duisenberg: We simply felt that the announcement of a range was more likely to be interpreted by the public at large as triggering automatic reactions than the announcement of a rate, a reference rate. We may have been wrong in that feeling, but that was our - let\\'s say - psychological estimate of public reactions. And then I should like to point out that, if you read that press statement, you will see the reference rate given as 4 1/2%, and specifically so. For the same reason, it has not been given as 4.5%, but rather as 4 1/2%.  Question: Is the harmonisation of tax rates in Europe desirable or useful or necessary for the success of Economic and Monetary Union?  Duisenberg: Whether it is desirable or useful or necessary has not been discussed by the Governing Council. If you want my personal opinion, I regard it as something that will happen over time. And over time means that it could take decades, a process of tax structures starting to look more like one another, without perhaps ever becoming totally equal.   Question: When you were in London a couple of days ago, you said you wanted the ECB to be one of the most open banks, central banks, in the world. Yet it is still not your intention to publish minutes, to publish votes or to publish inflation forecasts. How do you reconcile these two positions?  Duisenberg: I reconcile them by not defining openness as publishing everything that would be available. And that openness, by the definition of openness, is publishing, explaining every decision, every consideration, including the pros and cons. To be very open about that and to be frequent and immediate in that openness. And I think, I admit, we have been a central bank for only 5 months. I am still pretentious in thinking that, looking at our record of publications, etc., we already are the most open central bank in the world.  Question: Mr. President, I have noticed that your comments on the European economy were more cautious, significantly more cautious this time than last time and the times before. And I just wanted to get an indication of the forecast range for GDP growth that you implicitly assumed in your M3 forecast of 2-2 1/2%, whether that is still your latest forecast and whether there is in that forecast range a trend downwards or upwards. In other words, is this currently a symmetric GDP estimate?  Duisenberg: Very preliminary forecasts for GDP growth in 1999 indicate some slowdown, compared with 1998. In 1998 we already had to lower the estimate slightly from around 3%; it would be now in all likelihood be slightly, only slightly, below 3%. Our very preliminary forecasts for 1999 indicate a range of growth in the order of 2 1/2%, and they also indicate that this slowdown might be temporary, that it might pick up somewhat later next year. But, adding to that, I think the risks, as far as we can analyse and observe them, are on the down side.  Question (translation): President Duisenberg, are there any concerns which you or your colleagues have with respect to the stock of confidence in the euro, concerns which we should know about? That is my first question. It has been reported time and again - my second question - that leading policy makers in Italy, in France and in Germany are saying in small inner circles that they want to draw on central bank reserves to finance additional programmes within the scope of the European employment pact. If that were so - the first policy maker to say so was Mr. Prodi, who is no longer in office - what position would you take?  Duisenberg: With regard to the first question as to whether is there a certain concern which we have not told you about yet, the answer is \"no\". The concerns we have are implicit in the forecasts or assessments of the outlook as we see it developing in 1999. Perhaps, as I have just indicated in the answer to the previous question, there is some concern that there will be some moderation in the rate of growth and that the risks are more on the downside than on the upside. With regard to the second question, I can note that you refer to small inner circles. I was part of such a small inner circle last week, when I attended the meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Euro-11 countries together with the Vice-President, and we did not hear any utterances or comments pointing in the direction you suggested. On the contrary, we heard a re-confirmation by the Ministers of Finance of their will to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact.  Question: How do you think the European citizens will feel and experience what will happen after the New Year?  Duisenberg: They will feel as excited as I feel around the year-end. I do not know how they will feel. What we hope to inspire is that they, approaching that day and from that day onwards, look to the future with confidence, confidence in their own future and confidence in the European Central Bank.  Question: Mr. President, this reference value of 4 1/2% - I am wondering: with the changeover to a single currency, there has been a lot of talk about a change in this system, in structural changes, and that could have an effect on the money supply. And I am wondering what sort of assumptions there are now about how the money supply will be affected. First, are you considering it would be going up or possibly down? Second, there has been a lot of talk about the policy mix in recent weeks, and I am just wondering what are you assuming in terms of wage agreements with this reference value. We have seen agreements coming through on the order of 3.5%, e.g. in the chemical industry. Is this something you are also looking at?  Duisenberg: With regard to the uncertainties surrounding the changeover, the structure, they pertain not only to the development of the money supply, but to one thing in particular, i.e. also to the velocity of the circulation of money. The reference value, as I told you in my introductory remarks, has to be seen as the summing up or the addition of the trend rate of growth of the euro economy, which we estimate at between 2 and 2.5%, and with respect to which we have emphasised that, if the process of adjustment or change in the supply factors on the labour market structural policies were to continue, one could have a higher trend rate of growth. But this trend rate is based on past experience, with all the rigidities that were there. Then we have the trend value for prices which is defined as the rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), a rate below 2%. And, finally, on the velocity of circulation, we are also not quite certain about it. We estimate that the velocity of circulation is on a slightly downward trend of between one-half and one percentage point per year. Now, it is quite uncertain how the transition to the euro will in itself affect behavioural relations. And, in particular, more than you suggested regarding the money supply, it is quite uncertain what it will do to the velocity of circulation of money. So, we cannot do anything but assume that the trends in all three areas - the money supply, prices and velocity - will broadly continue in the future. That altogether forms the basis for our reference value, but it also forms the justification for calling it a reference value, rather than a target which it specifically is not. In practice, deviations of actual figures from the reference value over the medium term will also be evaluated and judged and can lead - but will not necessarily mechanistically lead - to monetary policy decisions.  Question (translation): Mr. President, in one month\\'s time the European Central Bank will begin to use its powers. Some economic analysts say that you will then be the world\\'s most powerful man in the economic field. Some European governments actually fear that happening. How will you respond?  Duisenberg: Well, I have never regarded Mr. Greenspan as the most important or powerful man in the world and neither do I regard myself - or the European Central Bank, for that matter - as, in qualitative terms, the most important man or institution in the world. We do recognise that, through our measures and through our attitude, we will have an important impact on the economic climate in the euro area. That is, I think that, if that climate were to be one of stability, continuity and growth, then we would be very satisfied and we would be all the more satisfied, the greater the extent is to which we can contribute to creating this climate.  Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, what do you think of the idea of the policy mix which Oskar Lafontaine launched in discussions with his statement that employment policy always also has something to do with monetary policy?  Duisenberg: No matter which Minister brought it up, my answer, in general, is that, of course, monetary policy and fiscal policy have something to do with employment policy, but I cannot but repeat what I have always said and what is said in the Treaty, namely that the best contribution monetary policy can make to the growth of the economy and to the growth of employment is to create a stable climate. A climate of price stability is the best thing we can deliver; and to the extent that we deliver price stability, then, as the Treaty says, without prejudice to the price stability, monetary policy should and will contribute to the other economic roles as specified in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.  Question: You mentioned tonight, as you have in the past, the importance of euro area governments engaging in structural reform in their labour and product markets. Do you see that urging governments to take actions on national territory is an important part of your role and is there a risk you\\'ll be seen as interfering in national affairs if you continue to make those kinds of suggestions?  Duisenberg: I do see it as an important, I should say \"almost\" important, part of our role. Because if we don\\'t urge governments to act in that way, who else will? And it is also an important part of our role because it is our task to help create the climate to do just that, and we feel not inhibited to point out that role that governments have to play on the basis of our analysis. Just as little as governments feel inhibited to point out the role the European Central Bank would have to play. We listen to one another, we hear one another, and we hope to come to the correct decision.  Question: I think there is strong pressure from the politicians, especially from the German Finance Minister, and how do you keep the independence of the ECB? Could you elaborate what kind of relation will be desirable?  Duisenberg: We keep and maintain the independence by strictly adhering to our mandate which includes that we are forbidden to follow instructions or suggestions from others, just as others are forbidden even to give such instructions. Apart from that, we will never shy away from a dialogue with other responsible authorities, a dialogue concerning our and other policies. So, we do participate in Euro-11 meetings; we do invite the President of the ECOFIN Council to every meeting of the Governing Council, as the Treaty prescribes. We do answer invitations and follow up on invitations from the ECOFIN Council to attend their meetings. We do anticipate so far as it goes even that the President of the ECOFIN Council has the right not only to attend the meeting of the Governing Council, but also to submit a motion for deliberation to the Governing Council. The only right he does not have is to vote on that motion.  Question: I wanted to ask you, when you said that your discussion about the rate level from the start had deepened on the broad outlook for price developments, it sounds as though the outlook is fairly favourable. How strongly should one interpret that? This is one thing I would like to ask you to talk more about.  Duisenberg: We have not reached conclusions, but we are now only four weeks away from actually entering Stage Three. And, before we go into that, we have to set the interest rate with which we will enter Stage Three. So it is only logical that our discussion, now that the moment of truth draws nearer, is intensifying and deepening and I might say livening up. But conclusions, we are not there yet.  Question: During this autumn, during the financial turbulence in Asia and Russia, the currencies in the euro area have been relatively stable, whereas currencies outside the euro area, such as the Swedish Crown, have lowered their value. The lowered value of a currency, as in the case of the Swedish Crown, does that make it more difficult if Sweden would like to join the euro area in some years?  Duisenberg: Whenever Sweden decides to join the euro area, if it decides to do so and when it decides to do so, one thing is certain: it will have to have demonstrated beforehand, a considerable time beforehand, that its exchange rate will not have been volatile vis-à-vis the euro for a prolonged period of time. That is what will be required.   Question: Though in view of the Europe-wide reform, structural reforms that you are talking about, that are taking place and the fact that the Bank of England is, if you like, a substantial shareholder in the new ECB, would it be more helpful if the Bank was actually on the inside of your Councils, rather than being sidelined, as it is at the moment.  Duisenberg: Well, apart from the Bank of England being a shareholder, although they have to pay up only 5 % of that capital subscription, so I would delete the word substantial. This is my personal opinion. I would have preferred the U.K. participating in the euro area and that\\'s a normative political opinion which I have.  Question: What is the chance that Eurozone rates will have fully converged by the next meeting, the December 22 meeting, and what are the chances that we will get an announcement on December 22 of what the initial refinance rate will be?  Duisenberg: I cannot answer the question. I could answer the question if the date you had mentioned was 31 December and then my answer would have been that the chances are 100%.  Question: Mr. President, what about granting us the pleasure of helping us even before Christmas and making one of these long winter evenings short by holding yet another press conference for us before Christmas.  Duisenberg: On 22 December, to my recollection, that is just before Christmas, we will have a press conference.  M. Körber: Ladies and Gentlemen, I think this was a very good conclusion, because this will make sure that we meet each other here on 22 December for another prolonged winter evening, as Mr. Balkhausen put it. Thank you for coming and thank you for your patience.  ']\n",

Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank at a Conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs on European economic and Monetary Union \"Markets and Politics under the Euro\", London 27 november 1998', '  Keynote address on The European System of Central Banks, Current position and future prospects   to be delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank at a Conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs on European economic and Monetary Union \"Markets and Politics under the Euro\", London 27 november 1998      1. Introduction    Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation at being invited to deliver a speech at this conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs. It is a great pleasure for me to be here, in London, today.  The topic I am going to address relates to the current position and the future prospects of the European System of Central Banks. I feel that this topic provides me with an opportunity to deal with the objective of the ESCB and its contribution to the other policies in the Community. I will also briefly touch upon the decision-making in the ESCB, recall the main features of our monetary policy strategy and talk about our regard for openness and transparency. The final part of my talk will cover the views of the ESCB on recent economic developments and the future outlook for price stability in the euro area.      2. Independence, transparency and accountability    In the Maastricht Treaty the ESCB has been given an independent status. The reason is that politicians all over the world have come round to the view that monetary policy decisions taken with too close a political involvement tend to take too short a time horizon into consideration. The consequence is that in the longer term such decisions do not support sustainable gains in employment and income, but only lead to higher inflation. This view is confirmed by a host of economic research.   Independence, however, requires a clear mandate. The ESCB has such a mandate. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community. Price stability is not an end in itself: it creates the conditions in which other, higher-order, objectives can be reached. In particular, I share the deep concerns about the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Europe. The ESCB will do what it can to contribute to the solution of this problem. By maintaining price stability inflation expectations and interest rates can be kept at a low level. This creates a stability-oriented environment which fosters sustainable growth, a high level of employment, a fair society and better living standards. Moreover, in specific circumstances, if production, inflation and employment all move in the same direction, monetary policy can play some role in stabilising output and employment growth without endangering price stability. However, the contribution from monetary policy can generally be only limited. Given the structural nature of the unemployment problems the solution is to be found, above all, in structural reforms aimed at well-functioning labour and product markets.   An independent central bank does not only need a clear mandate. It has also to be an open and transparent institution, for at least three reasons. First, transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy by creating the correct expectations on the part of economic agents. A predictable monetary policy contributes to achieving stable prices without significant adjustment costs and with the lowest interest rate possible. The second reason is that in a democratic society the central bank has to account for its policies. Finally, transparency towards the outside world can also structure and discipline the internal debate inside the central bank.   Let me now turn to the ways and means of achieving transparency. As a first element the ESCB has defined a quantitative objective for price stability. It reads as follows: price stability is a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Although I do not consider deflation to be likely in the current environment, I may add that a situation of falling prices would not be consistent with price stability.   The Governing Council has made it clear that \"Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term\". The ESCB cannot be held accountable for short-run deviations from price stability, for example due to shocks in import prices or specific fiscal measures. A monetary policy reaction to short-run fluctuations in the price level would provide the wrong signals to the market and cause unnecessary interest rate volatility. In summary, the ESCB will react in an appropriate, measured and, when necessary, gradualist manner to economic disturbances that threaten price stability in the medium term, rather than in an abrupt way, in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions of the process of economic growth. That said, the ESCB will, whenever necessary, openly discuss and explain the sources of possible deviations from the quantitative definition of price stability.   In addition, let me remind you that by focusing on the HICP for the euro area, the ESCB makes it clear that it will base its decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euro area as a whole. The single monetary policy has to take a euro area-wide perspective: it will not react to specific regional or national developments.  The institutional implication is that the ESCB should develop into a strong unity, with a strong centre and strong national central banks. It should become a truly European institution, with a truly European outlook. Of course, it may take some time to arrive where we ultimately want to be. We have to get used to thinking in euro area-wide terms. In the ECB Governing Council we are already \"practising\" that approach and are making progress. I am confident that the ESCB will indeed act as a unity.   Transparency and openness will be apparent from the way in which the ESCB communicates with the public. The ESCB will regularly present its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and provide information about each specific monetary policy decision, be it a move in interest rates or an absence of change. This will notably be done by way of press releases, press conferences, publications and speeches. Press releases are made available immediately after the fortnightly meetings of the Governing Council and, as you may know, they always include a precise list of the decisions taken together with background information.   There will be a monthly press conference. Such a press conference will start with a detailed introductory statement, as has been the case so far, and these introductory statements will also be published immediately, without delay. In this statement the Vice-President and I will present the Governing Council\\'s view of the economic situation and the underlying arguments for its monetary policy decisions, followed by a question and answer session.  The publications of the ESCB will include, in particular, an ECB Bulletin each month as well as an Annual Report. As from 1999, a detailed analysis of the economic situation in the euro area will be presented in the monthly Bulletin. Thematic articles in this Bulletin will include in-depth analyses by the ECB on matters regarding the monetary policy of the ESCB and the economy of the euro area. Further, you may also recall that, as required by its Statute, the ESCB will publish its consolidated balance sheet on a weekly basis.   My colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and I intend to be very active in giving speeches dealing with all issues of relevance for the conduct of monetary policy. I am convinced that the Governors of the national central banks will also play their role in this respect.   Since I am talking about the communication and external relations of the ESCB, I would like to underline that I am prepared to accept invitations to appear before the European Parliament at least four times a year to present the activities of the ESCB and the ECB\\'s Annual Report. Finally, it should be noted that the ESCB will have a regular exchange of information and views with the ECOFIN. Representatives of the ECB will be invited to ECOFIN meetings whenever issues of concern to monetary policy are discussed. A similar relationship will naturally also exist with the EURO-11, whose meetings will generally be attended by the President of the ECB, whenever matters relevant to the ESCB are on the agenda.      3. Monetary policy strategy of the ESCB    We are now approaching the start of the Third Stage of EMU. The decision-making bodies of the ECB have made a certain number of important decisions since the ESCB was established. As part of these decisions, the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB was recently announced and explained to the public. The selected stability-oriented strategy promotes as much continuity as possible with the existing strategies of national central banks in the EU. At the same time, its design is adapted to the unique situation of introducing a single currency in eleven countries, which may to a certain extent change economic behaviour. Therefore as much continuity as possible and as much change as required is the thrust of our strategy.   Our strategy consists of two pillars. The first is an important role for money and the second is a broad-based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area. The main reason for assigning a prominent role to money is the empirically well-founded view that inflation, at least in the long run, is a monetary phenomenon. This simple and obvious observation led the Governing Council to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad measure of money. This choice will create a \"nominal anchor\" for monetary policy and therefore help stabilise private inflation expectations at longer horizons. The reference value will be derived in a manner that is clearly consistent with - and serves the achievement of - price stability. It will be constructed such that, in the absence of special factors or other distortions, deviations of monetary growth from the reference value will signal risks to price stability.   However, it has to be clear that the reference value is different from an intermediate monetary target, as the ESCB has not made any commitment to correct deviations of actual monetary growth from the reference value over the short term. In particular, it has been realistically recognised that the move to a single currency and ongoing financial innovations may generate fluctuations in the selected monetary aggregate which are not necessarily associated with inflationary or deflationary pressures. For this reason, it is important to continuously monitor the relevance of temporary factors or even structural changes in order to avoid a mechanistic policy reaction to deviations of the chosen monetary aggregate from the reference value. The results of this analysis and its impact on the ESCB\\'s monetary policy decisions will be explained to the public.   Let me turn now to the second key element of the monetary policy strategy, the broad-based assessment of the risks to price stability. The information contained in monetary aggregates, while of the utmost importance, will by no means constitute the whole of the \"information set\" in the hands of the ESCB. In parallel with the analysis of money growth, a wide range of economic and financial variables will be used to formulate an assessment of the outlook for price developments. The envisaged strategy will enable the ESCB to perform a cross-check between the information coming from the evolution of monetary aggregates and those from other economic and financial indicators.      4. Recent economic developments and prospects    Let me turn to the current economic situation. The euro area experienced a strengthening of economic growth in 1997, to 2.5%, and a further acceleration has been anticipated for this year. The global environment has, of course, deteriorated in the meantime, but this has not so far had an observable impact on growth which has, in any event, been increasingly led by domestic demand. Inflation has remained subdued and even fallen somewhat over the past year, partly as a result of the impact of weaker global demand on oil and commodity prices. However, the favourable pattern of inflation has also been supported by domestic factors, such as a very moderate development in unit labour costs and industrial producer prices.   Concerning recent price developments, HICP inflation for the euro area fell to 1.0% in September, due to a strong impact from food prices, but I would not want to read too much into this latest decline as some price components can be relatively volatile over short periods. More significantly, preliminary data suggest that various broad monetary aggregates for the euro area are increasing at between 3 and 5%, and thus do not appear to signal any strong incipient inflationary or deflationary pressures. We are in line with the consensus view that inflation in the euro area will rise moderately in 1999, but remain below 2%. I do not consider deflation to be a serious risk for price stability at present.   So far, despite the worsening of the global environment, euro area-wide activity has continued to expand at a fairly stable rate. At around 3%, annual real GDP growth was broadly unchanged in the first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of 1997. Industrial production growth has slowed somewhat since the spring. More recent evidence, particularly that of the area-wide survey data, may also suggest a moderation in the pace of growth and further developments in these indicators will continue to be monitored closely. Area-wide growth should, however, be supported by a number of domestic factors. One factor supporting continued growth, particularly in private consumption, is the gradual improvement in labour market conditions. Moreover, the lowest short-term interest rates in the euro area currently stand at 3.3%, and several countries have cut interest rates towards this level recently as part of the process towards interest rate convergence. The process of convergence towards this level has been gradual, but should imply a reduction in the average short-term interest rate in the euro area of about 0.5 percentage point since July. Long-term rates also stand at low levels. And, there has been a marked degree of exchange rate stability among countries participating in the euro. This is undoubtedly a welcome development from the standpoint of encouraging trade and investment. Thus, our assessment is similar to that of other international organisations, that - unless the international environment deteriorates further, which is not currently expected - growth will be somewhat weaker in 1999. Growth should, however, remain high enough to support continued employment creation and, assuming a recovery in the international environment, there should be a pick-up in growth in the year 2000. At the meetings in December the ECB Governing Council will again assess the outlook for economic and price developments.   Although the economic outlook may be less favourable than expected - let us say - half a year ago, I believe that the conditions for a successful launch of the euro are in place. You can be sure that the ESCB will do its utmost to make the euro a stable currency.  ']\n",
      "['1998-11-26', 'Otmar Issing', 'The European Central Bank on the eve of EMU', 'Professor Otmar Issing, Speech delivered to the LSE European Society London School of Economics on 26 November 1998 in London', '  The European Central Bank on the eve of EMU   Professor Otmar Issing, Speech delivered to the LSE European Society London School of Economics on 26 November 1998 in London      Introduction: Opportunities and risks    In only slightly more than one month\\'s time, the curtain will rise on a world premiere. Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will commence. The eleven participating nations will transfer their monetary policy sovereignty to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Henceforth, the euro will become the single currency for a population of almost 300 million people. Although the new notes and coins denominated in euro will not circulate for another three years, a single monetary policy for the entire euro area will be determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt .  Bringing Europe to the threshold of Monetary Union has been a tremendous achievement, the culmination of more than a decade of preparation and convergence. But the greatest challenges lie ahead. As with any great enterprise - and surely Monetary Union is one -these unprecedented challenges entail both opportunities and risks.  Monetary Union offers the opportunity for Europe to unleash its enormous creative and productive potential. Through lowering transactions costs and making pricing more transparent, Monetary Union will create larger and more integrated markets. These, in turn, will spur greater competition and innovation. A truly continental single market will be created.  But above all, Monetary Union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability throughout the euro area. We must ensure that this great opportunity is not missed. Price stability is at the heart of the \\'stability culture\\' that we are creating in Europe - a culture that is a necessary foundation for improving output and employment prospects. Only in an environment of stable prices can truly sustainable and lasting improvements in the standard of living of Europe \\'s citizens be generated.  However, a transformation of the magnitude and importance of EMU is inevitably attended by some risks. They relate, in part, to the possibility of breaks in previously well established economic relationships and behaviour that may complicate our interpretation of the euro area-wide economic data, and therefore the implementation of the single monetary policy. At the ESCB, we are well aware of these risks. They are thoroughly monitored and carefully addressed. We are confident that we can manage the challenges that they pose successfully in the coming years.  But the ESCB does not operate in a vacuum. It is affected by changes in its environment: both by developments in the rest of the world, and by the policies and actions of other institutions and the private sector in the euro area itself. As we approach EMU in January, in my view, it is in some of these areas - rather than directly in the field of monetary policy - where the greatest risks lie.  Unfortunately, developments in the world economy have not been favourable of late. Starting with the exchange rate and financial crises in Asia last year, we have faced a lengthy period of financial market turmoil. Within this turmoil, the euro area itself has been a \\'zone of stability\\' - a mark of the advantages offered by the process of Monetary Union itself. But both the market volatility and the real effects of the crises in Asia and, more recently, in Russia have increased the uncertainty surrounding the prospects for economic growth and price stability in the global economy as a whole, including the outlook for the euro area. There have been encouraging signs in the last few weeks that this volatility has been somewhat contained. However, these international crises have clearly increased the uncertainty faced by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three.  Further uncertainties and risks are \\'home-grown\\' within the euro area itself. Although a monetary policy that maintains price stability is a prerequisite for Europe \\'s future prosperity, monetary policy alone cannot ensure strong, non-inflationary growth and improved employment prospects throughout the euro area. Monetary policy can simply ensure that the fundamentals are in place. Only appropriate fiscal policies and badly needed structural reforms can directly influence growth and employment. Although the Stability and Growth Pact should impose an important discipline on fiscal policy, national governments must ensure that the dangerous fiscal profligacy of the past is not repeated. The enormous implicit liabilities implied by public pension and health care systems must also be addressed.  Structural reforms to improve the flexibility of Europe \\'s labour markets are absolutely necessary in many countries. Indeed, reducing market rigidities in general is desirable, so that resources can be directed to their most productive uses. The private sector also has its part to play, notably by exercising wage moderation. Progress on all these dimensions is not only desirable, but also absolutely vital.  In this context, let me emphasise that the ECB Governing Council naturally shares the public\\'s understandable concerns about the current unacceptably high rate of unemployment in the euro area. But Europe \\'s unemployment is largely structural in origin. Implementing structural reforms is the only lasting solution. This is not an easy task. However, governments must muster the courage to make these vital reforms immediately.  It is through maintaining price stability that the ESCB can best contribute to raising welfare and employment in the euro area. Only in this way can the ESCB serve the public\\'s interests and provide the stable environment where necessary structural reforms can work effectively. The current stance of monetary policy in the euro area is focused, as it should be, on maintaining price stability - it is neither inflationary nor deflationary. Nevertheless, let me emphasise that pursuit of an inflationary monetary policy would not solve Europe \\'s unemployment problems. If the ESCB were to pursue an inflationary policy, it would simply lead to higher unemployment in the long run, as the important benefits of price stability for job creation are foregone. Longer-term interest rates would rise as inflation expectations and risk premia increase, thereby raising the cost companies face when making the investment necessary for sustainable future economic growth. An inflationary policy would therefore be entirely counter-productive. The ESCB is determined to protect price stability, not least from the dangers inherent in political interference in monetary policy.  With these opportunities and risks in mind, today I will discuss the theme \\'the European Central Bank on the eve of EMU\\'. First, I will address the institutional context in which the ECB operates - its structure and its objective, namely the maintenance of price stability. Second , I will describe the ESCB\\'s recently announced stability-oriented monetary policy strategy that will achieve this objective; and finally , I will outline the monetary policy instruments available to the ESCB that will be used to implement this strategy.       The European Central Bank         The institutional framework     The European System of Central Banks was created by the Maastricht Treaty to design, decide and implement the euro area\\'s single monetary policy. It consists of the fifteen national central banks (NCBs) of the European Union, plus a central institution - the European Central Bank - based in Frankfurt . As regards monetary policy, the key decision-making body of the ESCB is the Governing Council of the ECB. At present, this Council has seventeen members: the NCB Governors or Presidents of the eleven countries participating in EMU from the outset and the six members of the ECB\\'s own Executive Board.  It is important to realise that, although only the six members of the Executive Board are appointed on a centralised European-wide basis, all members of the Governing Council are obliged to pursue the Treaty mandate of price stability. The Governors of NCBs are not representatives of their country or delegates of their home institutions. They are appointed to the Council as individuals who share a collective obligation under the Treaty to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council is therefore determined to take an area-wide perspective in analysing the economic and monetary data. This is absolutely necessary: with a unified single monetary policy, policy decisions must be made in a manner that reflects conditions across the euro area in its entirety. This pre-requisite was clearly recognised in the announcement of the main elements of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy in October: \"[the Governing Council] will base its  decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euro area as a whole. The single monetary policy will adopt a euro area-wide perspective; it will not react to specific regional or national developments.\"   The Governing Council\\'s recent decision to meet on a fortnightly basis will serve to intensify this necessary area-wide approach. A regular and frequent collegial discussion of the single monetary policy will inevitably foster an area-wide perspective, as members of the Governing Council exchange their views on the economic situation and the direction of policy focusing on the euro area as a whole.       Independence and accountability     To guarantee that the single monetary policy is strictly focused on the primary objective of price stability in an effective and credible way, the Treaty has conferred considerable independence on the ESCB. In making monetary policy decisions, the Governing Council is not subject to political interference. The reasons for this independence are well understood - indeed, they were the dominant reason for giving the Bank of England its new status in May 1997, after a long period of being subordinate to the government. It is widely recognised - although perhaps not widely enough - that a lack of independence can easily lead central banks to focus on the short-term and, thus, fail to adopt the forward-looking, medium-term orientation that is crucial for a successful monetary strategy. The Maastricht Treaty is based on the belief - confirmed by a substantial body of recent empirical economic research - that delegating monetary policy decisions to an independent institution with a clearly defined and specific mandate improves the quality of policy-making, results in more stable prices and therefore facilitates both sustainable real growth and lasting improvements in living standards, as I described a moment ago. Such a delegation of the responsibility of monetary policy to an independent central bank therefore serves the interest of the public at large.  Nevertheless, in a democratic context, there is no doubt that this institutional independence must be supplemented by accountability to the public. As I will describe in a moment, the ESCB\\'s mandate is clear and limited - it must maintain price stability. The ESCB\\'s independence is crucial in achieving this objective, but the ESCB must also be prepared to explain to the public, in an encompassing manner, how its monetary policy has been geared to this goal.  Before turning to the details spelt out in the Treaty, it is crucial to place the independence and accountability of the ESCB in a wider context. The ESCB\\'s independence and its primary objective of price stability are established in a Treaty that was subject to intense public scrutiny and debate. The Treaty was finally ratified by all fifteen Member States of the European Union. Moreover, in several of the participating countries, the Treaty was endorsed by popular referenda. This confers a maximum democratic legitimacy on the ESCB\\'s independence guaranteed in the Treaty.  The Treaty itself imposes very high standards of accountability on the ESCB. We must produce a quarterly report on the activities of the ESCB, and submit an Annual Report to the European Parliament, Council and Commission. The European Parliament will hold a general debate on the report it receives, and the ECB President and Executive Board members will have to answer questions posed by its parliamentary committees. These are among the most stringent reporting requirements for any central bank. But the ESCB intends to go further. Through regular press conferences after Governing Council meetings, speeches and a monthly report, the ECB is committed to keeping the public informed about its decisions and the economic rationale on which they are based. A press conference will be held immediately following the first Governing Council meeting of every month. An extensive statement of the Council\\'s view of the economic situation and the outlook for price developments will be presented by the President, followed by a question and answer session. The schedule for these meetings and conferences has already been announced for 1999.  Discussion papers and technical analysis by the ECB staff will be published for professional review and scientific assessment. Furthermore, in these articles and other presentations, we will address various major economic problems facing Europe , not least the problem of the high level of unemployment. In doing so, we will make the best possible use of experts knowledge throughout the whole ESCB and ensure that this expertise is available to the wider policy-making community.  Of course, it not only matters that we make reports, but also what these reports contain. They must be informative, clear and meaningful. The ECB is committed to communicating with the public in a clear and transparent manner. The monetary policy strategy recently selected by the Governing Council has been designed with these commitments in mind. Against this background, the ESCB will stand any comparison on the grounds of accountability and transparency.       The Treaty mandate: price stability     The Maastricht Treaty stipulates that the \"primary objective of the ESCB shall be to  maintain price stability. It was left to the ESCB to provide a quantitative definition of this primary objective. In the interests of transparency and accountability the Governing Council has agreed that the ESCB\\'s chosen operational definition of price stability should be announced publicly. This announcement forms an important element of the overall monetary policy strategy, and constitutes a clear benchmark against which the public can properly judge the performance of the single monetary policy.  The Governing Council has decided that \"price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below  2%.\" It almost goes without saying that the Governing Council is fully committed to the maintenance of price stability on this definition. The definition of price stability is intended to be a lasting quantification of the commitments made by the Governing Council in relation to its Treaty mandate.  The \\'headline\\' measure of the HICP is the appropriate index to use in the definition. It is harmonised across the countries participating in Monetary Union and is consistent with the general public\\'s usual focus on consumer prices. The definition embodies a euro area measure of the price level, signalling the area-wide perspective that should be adopted in the conduct and assessment of monetary policy.  This definition clearly signals that the Governing Council is symmetrically concerned about both inflation and deflation. The phrase \"below 2%\\' clearly delineates the rate of inflation in the HICP deemed consistent with price stability. The wording \"year-on-year increases\" implies that prolonged decreases in the HICP - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be considered consistent with price stability.  In this way, the definition takes into account the threats posed by ongoing deflation in combination with nominal rigidities to the real economy. While periodic and transitory falls in the price level may be quite normal, and should not give rise to major concerns, a prolonged deflation is clearly inconsistent with any meaningful definition of price stability. Moreover, since nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, the private expectation of a sustained fall in the price level may render the interest rate policy of the central bank rather ineffective. All that remains is out-right purchases of assets - both foreign and domestic.  However, to make myself absolutely clear, this discussion of deflation refers to the definition of price stability. I would not want to be seen as suggesting that a sustained deflation is an imminent threat. \\'Headline\\' price inflation in the euro area has been reduced by the falls in international commodity prices that have stemmed, in part, from the crises in Asia and Russia . Such falls in commodity prices may not persist. Moreover, measures of \\'core\\' inflation for the euro area - which exclude energy prices and other volatile components of the price index - are still higher than the headline rate.  Among economists in academic, financial and central banking circles, it is widely recognised that a \\'measurement bias\\' can exist in consumer price indices (CPIs). The bias arises from changing spending patterns and quality improvements in those goods and services that are included in the basket used to define a specific price index. These effects are sometimes not fully corrected in the construction of price indices. The measurement bias causes CPIs to overstate the \\'true\\' rate of inflation. It is well- established central bank practice to allow for such measurement bias in the definition of price stability - for example, this approach was adopted by many national central banks in the euro area in recent years. However, I should emphasise that the HICP has been constructed with a view to minimising any measurement bias. It is therefore quite likely that the bias in the HICP is smaller than that observed in national CPIs. This might substantially reduce the risk of de facto deflation in euro area consumer prices while the measured price index continues to show an increase.  The Governing Council has also announced that price stability will be \"maintained over  the medium-term\". This announcement points to the need for the single monetary policy to have a forward-looking, medium-term orientation. It acknowledges the existence of short- term volatility in the price level that cannot be controlled by monetary policy alone. The single monetary policy will react in an appropriate, measured and, when necessary, gradualist manner to economic disturbances that threaten price stability in the medium- term, rather than in a reflexive or unconscious way.  The ESCB can build on the success of its constituent NCBs in reducing inflation and achieving price stability during the convergence process in Stage Two of EMU. Given the current generally benign inflation outlook in the euro area that is the product of these accomplishments, there is an understandable desire to \\'lock-in\\' the current success by maintaining price stability as well as the apparent credibility of monetary policy, and ensure continuity with existing central bank practice.        The ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy         The importance of the monetary policy strategy     With price stability clearly defined in this manner, how should the ESCB proceed to maintain it? In achieving and maintaining price stability - the primary objective of the Treaty - the choice of monetary policy strategy is vital.  The monetary policy strategy is, in the first place, important for the internal decision- making process of the ESCB - how the Governing Council will decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance, given the economic environment. Above all, the ESCB strategy must lead to good - that is to say, timely and forward-looking - monetary policy decisions.  But the strategy is also of the utmost significance in communicating with audiences outside the ESCB. In particular, the strategy must convince the public that the Governing Council is unambiguously committed to maintaining price stability in the euro area and has the resources, information and instruments available to fulfil this commitment. The more the strategy helps to promote credibility and confidence in the ESCB\\'s monetary policy, the more effective that policy will be - and the easier the ESCB\\'s task of maintaining price stability will become.       The policy-making environment at the outset of Stage Three     The need to establish a credible and consistent monetary strategy is especially important for the ESCB at the outset of Monetary Union. As a brand new institution, the ESCB will have no track record of its own.  Building its reputation, and the associated credibility of monetary policy, is vital. But the process of doing so is complicated by the relatively high level of uncertainty surrounding the transition to Monetary Union itself. The transition to Stage Three is a unique event, and as I have mentioned, it will create unique opportunities for many. However, the transition may also create some special problems for monetary policy makers. At the ECB, we are addressing these problems and are confident that the risks can be managed successfully. Some of the difficulties we face will be overcome through our own efforts. However, there are some uncertainties that remain beyond our control, such as the external shocks coming from the Asian and Russian financial crises that I mentioned a moment ago.  However, today I will focus on the uncertainties arising from the transition to Stage Three itself. The adoption of the single monetary policy marks a significant regime shift. This is likely to change the way expectations are formed in the euro area, and thereby alter forward-looking economic behaviour. The effect of monetary policy on consumption, investment, and wage bargaining - and therefore the whole transmission mechanism of monetary policy to developments in the price level - will be among the important economic relationships likely to be affected in this way.  This may be no bad thing. Indeed, the contribution of the regime shift implied by the transition to Stage Three to changing both public and private sector behaviour in favourable directions may be one of the largest gains that the euro area can extract from Monetary Union. Nevertheless, these changes are likely to complicate the implementation of certain important elements of a monetary strategy, at least in the short term, as past relationships between macroeconomic variables may no longer be sufficiently reliable.  One example of this so-called \\'Lucas critique\\' phenomenon is the impact of current, very low rates of inflation on private behaviour. For many countries participating in Monetary Union, there is simply no - or only very recent - experience of how the private sector will behave in an environment of sustained and credible low inflation. Instability in past relationships may result, should behaviour change in this new environment. I have already argued that these structural changes will benefit Europe \\'s citizens - price stability will allow markets to work more efficiently, thereby raising growth, and improving employment prospects. But these changes may also complicate the ESCB\\'s assessment of economic and financial conditions.  Moreover, Monetary Union is creating an entirely new economic area for which, until quite recently, harmonised and comprehensive data have simply not been collected or constructed. Although area-wide statistics are now available, they are based on new concepts, and the properties of the series are sometimes not yet well known. In some cases, the long runs of high quality back-data required for empirical economic analysis are unavailable.  These uncertainties - arising directly from the transition to Stage Three itself - are both compounded by, and inter-related with, the broader economic context in which Monetary Union will be established. The increasing internationalisation of the global economy, and the current rapid pace of technological change, have affected all sectors of the economy, and the banking and financial systems in particular. All these factors will alter the relationships between economic variables that NCBs have used as a guide to monetary policy decisions in the past.       The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy     The ECB Governing Council has selected a monetary policy strategy of its own, to reflect the unique circumstances that it faces at the start of Monetary Union. Given a desire to inherit the good reputation of its constituent NCBs prior to Stage Three, the chosen strategy exhibits as much as possible continuity with the successful strategies they have pursued in the past. At the same time the ESCB\\'s strategy takes into account to the extent needed the unprecedented challenges and specific uncertainties created by the introduction of the euro. The Governing Council has selected a \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\". Neither \\'pure\\' intermediate monetary targeting nor \\'pure\\' direct inflation targeting - which were sometimes referred to as the two most prominent candidates prior to the decision - nor a simple combination of both strategies was deemed to fulfil in an optimal way the ESCB\\'s unique needs.  The ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy rests on two pillars. Money will be assigned a prominent role, to be signalled by the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate. In parallel with the analysis of monetary developments relative to the announced reference value, a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area will be undertaken.  In selecting its monetary policy strategy, the foremost criterion used by the Governing Council was the principle of \\'effectiveness\\'. The best monetary policy strategy for the ESCB is the one which best signals a credible and realistic commitment to, and ensures achievement of, the primary objective of price stability.  I am aware that for many external commentators, this criterion points unambiguously in the direction of \\'direct inflation targeting\\'. If monetary strategies are to be judged according to how well they achieve price stability, defined as a low rate of measured inflation, then advocates of inflation targets argue an optimal strategy would surely target this low inflation rate directly. These commentators would place explicit quantitative targets for inflation itself at the centre of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy. Their approach has been strongly endorsed in some academic and central banking circles.  Indeed, here in the United Kingdom , the Bank of England has set the standard for developing and implementing a monetary strategy based on inflation targeting. Its Inflation Report undoubtedly represents \\'state-of-the-art\\'. However, the situation facing the ESCB is different in many respects, and its choice of strategy reflects these differences.  The ECB Governing Council\\'s choice of monetary policy strategy was not governed solely by a desire to signal again our intent to maintain price stability. This has already been well established - by the Treaty and by the transparent public announcement of our definition of price stability. Rather than mainly signalling our intent, the ESCB\\'s strategy must constitute a practical guide that ensures monetary policy is effective in achieving the goal we have been set.  As a practical guide, there are considerable problems with using inflation itself as the direct target for the ESCB\\'s overall strategy. Because of the well-known lags in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy in general, and the price level in particular, it is impossible for a central bank to control inflation directly. Therefore, \\'inflation targeting\\' in practice means \\'inflation forecast targeting\\' where central banks set monetary policy to keep their best forecast of inflation at the target level deemed consistent with price stability.  But recognition of this need for forecasts in an inflation targeting strategy immediately raises practical difficulties for the ESCB. In the uncertain environment likely to exist at the outset of Monetary Union, forecasting inflation will be difficult, not least because of the many conceptual, empirical and practical uncertainties faced by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three. Forecasting models estimated using historic data may not offer a reliable guide to the behaviour of the euro area economy under Monetary Union. Forecast uncertainty is likely to be relatively large.  Forecasting inflation requires thorough knowledge of the properties of the new euro area- wide data series and experience and understanding of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the new euro area economy. Both are likely to be quite different from what we have been used to in the existing environment of eleven distinct national economies prior to Monetary Union.  I see a distinct bias in the academic discussion of the comparative advantages of inflation targeting and monetary targeting. With good reason, many arguments are presented against the ESCB adopting a monetary target. But proponents of inflation targeting seem to forget that, in the current context, most of these arguments could also be used against inflation targeting. While there are many uncertainties about the economic properties of money in the special circumstances facing the ESCB, there are also considerable uncertainties surrounding the properties of inflation forecasts.  Moreover, the ESCB should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy of its internal forecasts, including its inflation forecasts. Indeed, since the published inflation forecast would be \\'conditional\\' - that is, it would be based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates - the forecast is unlikely to be very accurate. It will not capture the ESCB\\'s policy responses to any incipient inflationary or deflationary pressures. The forecast would therefore be an unsuitable measure of the ESCB\\'s professional competence or the success of its policies. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability - the primary objective assigned by the Treaty - should be used by the public to judge the success of the ESCB\\'s policies. Consequently, publication of a forecast is only important in so far as it helps to achieve price stability.  Against this background, let me make absolutely clear that the stability-oriented strategy selected by the ESCB Governing Council is not inflation targeting. The definition of price stability I discussed at some length is not an inflation target. It is a once and for all description of the mandate that the ESCB is committed to achieve. As long as the ESCB is governed by the existing provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, it will interpret its mandate as maintaining price stability on this published definition. This is quite different from an inflation targeting strategy where the target rate of inflation is set on a year-to-year basis with a specific horizon and the centrepiece of the strategy is a published inflation forecast. For the reasons I have outlined, this approach would not be suitable for the ESCB.  By the same token, the monetary policy strategy selected by the ESCB is not a variant of intermediate monetary targeting either. Certain technical pre-conditions have to be met before a monetary targeting strategy is feasible. Specifically, an intermediate monetary target would only be a meaningful guide to monetary policy if a stable relationship existed between money and prices, and money was controllable in the short run using policy determined interest rates.  In this regard, several existing empirical studies point towards the stability of the demand for euro area-wide monetary aggregates. However, the reliability and robustness of these results is unknown. First, many studies are based on a selection of EU countries that differs from the nations that will participate in Monetary Union as of January 1999. Moreover, the \\'area-wide\\' monetary data used for these investigations are estimates, having been more or less artificially constructed from national data rather than based on genuine consolidated euro area statistics. Second, the transition to Stage Three marks a significant regime shift that may prompt considerable changes in the banking sector and in private saving behaviour. How the economic properties of money will change in the face of the uncertainties raised by the transition to Stage Three is unknown. Future shifts in the velocity of money are certainly possible - perhaps even likely. They cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, it is not clear whether those aggregates that have the best results in terms of stability are sufficiently controllable in the short-term with the policy instruments available to the ESCB. In these circumstances, relying on a pure monetary targeting strategy would constitute an unrealistic, and therefore misguided, commitment.  However, since inflation is fundamentally monetary in origin over the longer-term, giving money a prominent role in the strategy is vital. It creates a firm \\'nominal anchor\\' for monetary policy and therefore helps to stabilise private inflation expectations at longer horizons. Assigning a prominent role to money in the overall stability-oriented monetary policy emphasises the responsibility of the ESCB for the monetary impulses to inflation, which a central bank can control more readily than inflation itself.  Consequently, the Governing Council will announce a quantitative reference value for monetary growth as one pillar of the overall stability-oriented strategy. This reference value is different from an intermediate monetary target, as the ESCB has not made any commitment to correct deviations of actual monetary growth from the reference value over the short-term. Monetary policy will not react \"mechanistically\" to deviations in this sense.  The reference value will be derived in a manner that ensures, as far as possible, that deviations of monetary growth from the value will signal risks to price stability. In the first instance, such a deviation will prompt further analysis to identify and interpret the economic disturbance that caused the deviation, and evaluate whether the disturbance requires a policy move to counter risks to price stability.  To extract the important signals about inflationary or deflationary pressures contained in the monetary data, the relationship between actual monetary growth and the reference value will be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council. The results of this analysis and its impact on monetary policy decisions will be explained to the public. Through this process, monetary policy decision-making will be made both clearer and more transparent.  Although the monetary data contain information vital to informed monetary policy making, on their own they will not constitute a complete summary of all the information about the economy required to set an appropriate monetary policy and maintain price stability. There is a clear need to look at other indicators. Therefore, in parallel with the analysis of monetary developments in relation to the reference value, the Governing Council will undertake a regular, broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. This assessment will embody a wide range of economic and financial indicators.  All the indicators will be thoroughly assessed for the signals that they offer about the threats to price stability over the medium-term and the information they contain regarding the appropriate monetary policy response to disturbances to the economy. This thorough analysis cannot be subsumed into a meaningful summary statistic or single number to which monetary policy will react in a mechanical way.  The monetary policy response required to maintain price stability over the medium-term will depend upon both the prevailing circumstances and the source of the threat to price stability. In this respect, a single forecast is clearly insufficient to provide the detailed information required to make appropriate and informed policy decisions.  All in all, the new stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ESCB is designed to avoid giving the impression that monetary policy responds \"mechanistically\" to deviations from a single target or the evolution of a specific variable. The monetary policy strategy selected by the ESCB signals that monetary policy decisions will focus on maintaining price stability over the medium-term, responding to new developments in the economy in a manner that is consistent with this over-riding objective.        New monetary policy instruments for the euro area     Having a well-designed monetary strategy is vital. I am confident that the strategy selected by the Governing Council will be successful and price stability in the euro area will be maintained. But we must also be able to implement the strategy effectively at an operational level. What instruments are available to implement this strategy?  The ESCB will have a complete set of monetary policy instruments at its disposal. These instruments have been selected on the basis of their efficiency for transmitting monetary policy and their neutrality across market participants.  Three types of instruments are available to the ESCB: open market operations, standing facilities and a minimum reserve system. I will briefly present these instruments in the remainder of my speech.  Open market operations include, first, a weekly main refinancing operation, which will take the form of a reverse repurchase transaction with a maturity of two weeks. The main refinancing operation will be based on a tender procedure. The tender may be a fixed rate tender, with counterparties bidding amounts, or a floating rate tender, where counterparties propose bids including both amounts and interest rates.  Second, there is the monthly longer term refinancing operation, which has a maturity of three months and will always take the form of an interest rate tender. This is because the ESCB will avoid signalling its monetary policy stance through these particular operations.  The ESCB is also equipped to conduct fine-tuning operations, through the national central banks of the euro area or, in exceptional circumstances, centrally. Fine tuning operations will be conducted only when liquidity or money market conditions warrant.  Finally, open market operations may also be conducted whenever structural reasons, such as the longer-term evolution of liquidity profiles, warrant it. These so-called structural operations may take the form of outright purchases or sales of securities or the issuance of debt certificates by the ECB.  The ECB will operate two overnight standing facilities, which will be available to all credit institutions at national central banks of the euro area, provided that, when using the marginal lending facility, they have sufficient collateral. The rate of the marginal lending facility will constitute the upper bound of collateralised overnight money market rates. The deposit facility will be remunerated at a rate that will constitute the lower bound of overnight money market rates.  When using the marginal lending facility, or, for that matter, when entering in liquidity- providing open market operations in the form of reverse transactions, counterparties have to post assets as collateral. These assets are meant to act as guarantees for credits received from the European System of Central Banks. A list of eligible assets has been drawn up for this purpose. The list comprises a wide variety of assets and has two sub\\xad sets. First, the so-called tier one assets, which are selected by the ECB according to uniform criteria relating to their credit standing in the whole euro area. Second, the so- called tier two assets, which have been selected by the ECB because they are of particular importance for certain national banking systems of the euro area, in order to promote a certain degree of continuity at the start of the Stage Three of EMU. Two principles of equal treatment are applied, however. First, the credit standing of tier two assets is as high as that of tier one assets. Second, both tier one and tier two assets may be used by any credit institution in the euro area, irrespective of its location.  In addition, a set of risk control measures has been elaborated to ensure that, for any counterparty, the amount of assets provided is always sufficient. Risk control measures cover the assets\\' price and credit risks, taking account of the asset type, its characteristics and the maturity of the transaction. The ECB\\'s risk control measures have been elaborated with careful attention to the best market practices in this area.  The ECB will also apply a minimum reserve system to credit institutions of the euro area. Two main monetary policy objectives have been assigned to the minimum reserve system.  The first objective is to stabilise money market interest rates through the averaging mechanism, whereby the fulfilment of minimum reserve requirements is based on average reserve holdings over monthly periods of time. During the maintenance period, this allows the banking system to absorb liquidity shocks without the need to use the standing facilities. The lower volatility of money market rates will reduce the need for frequent fine tuning operations, which will mean that markets are less distorted by central bank interventions than they would otherwise be. The second objective of the minimum reserve system is to increase the demand for central bank money, so as to enlarge the liquidity deficit of the banking system vis-a-vis the ESCB. This will safeguard the role of the European System of Central Banks as a provider of liquidity to the banking system.  Reserve requirements will be calculated by applying a reserve ratio of 2% to the deposits, debt securities and money market paper issued by credit institutions, except for maturities above two years. Although repurchase agreements are included in the reserve base, they will be subject to a zero reserve ratio. Inter-bank liabilities and liabilities vis-a-vis the ESCB will not be subject to reserve requirements. An allowance of E 100,000 will be deducted from reserve requirements, so that credit institutions with a small reserve base will not have to hold minimum reserves.  Reserve holdings will be remunerated up to the required reserve level, at the rate of the main refinancing operation (as averaged over the month). It may be argued that a less than full remuneration of minimum reserves would increase the interest rate elasticity of central bank money demand. This notwithstanding, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided in favour of a full remuneration of minimum reserves in view of the distortion to efficient markets that a less than full remuneration would have implied. The Governing Council has also decided not to exempt any credit institution from the minimum reserve system.       Concluding remarks     We are only thirty-six days away from the moment when the responsibility for monetary policy decisions in the euro area is officially transferred to the Governing Council of the ECB. A stability-oriented monetary policy strategy has been selected and the operational framework has been tested and will be in place as of January 1999. The public can be certain that we will always remain committed to the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, thereby ensuring that the single monetary policy makes its best contribution to growth and employment prospects. Within the ESCB\\'s stability oriented monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council has undertaken to inform the public, regularly and comprehensively, about its considerations and deliberations. We will make all our decisions transparent. Within this solid, open and convincing framework, I am confident that we are well prepared to accept responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area.

      "['1998-11-20', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The International Role of the Euro and the ESCB\\x92s Monetary Policy', 'Statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg,President of the European Central Bank,at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress on 20 November 1998 in Frankfurt am Main', \"  The International Role of the Euro and the ESCB\\x92s Monetary Policy   Statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg,President of the European Central Bank,at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress on 20 November 1998 in Frankfurt am Main I very much welcome the opportunity today to share some thoughts with you on the issue of the international role of the euro and the monetary policy strategy of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). In order to remain within the tight time frame and leave room for discussion, I shall try to be as concise as possible, and I shall therefore focus on the three questions addressed to me directly.      1. Is a significant international role for the euro a desirable goal?    Some observers have asserted that one of the main motives behind Economic and Monetary Union in Europe is the creation of a major international role for the euro, and that fostering such a role would be an important objective for the European Central Bank (ECB). Both assertions are incorrect. The purpose of the introduction of the euro is to promote economic integration and economic welfare in the Member States, and the objective of the ESCB \\x96 and of the ECB as part of this system \\x96 is to maintain price stability within the euro area. The ESCB will take a neutral stance towards an international role of the euro. It will neither hinder nor deliberately encourage the development of this role, but will rather leave this to market forces. The ESCB will, however, contribute indirectly to the international recognition of the euro by achieving its objective of maintaining price stability within the euro area. A successful monetary policy is a necessary condition, but not the only prerequisite for the international recognition and use of a currency. The reason is that the latter is a complex phenomenon. While there is no single international role for a currency, there are many uses for a currency in an international context. On the official side, they include the use of a currency as an anchor for exchange rate pegs, as a means of storing foreign exchange reserves, and as a vehicle for foreign exchange interventions. On the private side, they include the use as a quotation and vehicle currency for international trade, as a currency of denomination for financial assets, and as a substitute currency in circulation abroad. The significance of all these roles depends on the decisions of a large number of economic agents \\x96 including governments, central banks, institutional and private investors, corporations, and traders \\x96 which the central bank can only influence to a limited extent. While it is difficult and not always meaningful to make predictions about the overall international role of the euro, it seems safe to assert that it will be significant in a number of areas.  First, there are what one might call the static effects stemming from the changeover and the conversion of existing financial assets and liabilities into euro. That alone will already give the euro an internationally recognised role, since the euro area currencies, in general, and the Deutsche Mark, in particular, have played a significant role as anchor, reserve, investment and vehicle currencies in the past.  Second, and potentially even more important, there will be \\x91dynamic\\x92 effects stemming from new assets and liabilities acquired or issued in euro. Here, the creation of a large and liquid, integrated capital market will be the most important element in fostering such a development. For short-term instruments, there will be a broad and liquid European money market with a common overnight rate and very similar short-term interest rates for comparable instruments. At the longer end of the maturity spectrum, market integration will be jump-started by the re-denomination of outstanding government debt in euro on 1 January 1999. The elimination of the currency fragmentation in the European bond markets will also lead to the development of uniform market standards and the creation of a large and liquid market for portfolio investors. 2. How will the euro\\x92s international role influence the ECB\\x92s monetary policy? Having an international currency has significant advantages for businesses and consumers. It may, however, sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy. In the ESCB\\x92s monetary policy strategy, developments in monetary aggregates play a prominent role, and these developments will be analysed very carefully. If a significant part of the money stock were to circulate outside the euro area and if its development were to deviate from that circulating inside the euro area, this could be a source of instability in money demand. But this is only one of the challenges which the ESCB will be facing in analysing developments in monetary aggregates. Other challenges are related to changes in money demand as a result of the introduction of the euro itself. Together, these changes represent a structural break, and it is obviously difficult to predict how demand for money will evolve around such a break. The ESCB has taken these difficulties into account in its monetary policy strategy in that, firstly, it will announce only a reference value for a monetary aggregate, and not a target value. This means that, although monetary developments will be used as the main indicator of potential inflationary or disinflationary pressures, the ESCB will not react in an almost mechanical way to correct deviations from the reference value in the short term. Secondly, the ESCB will not focus solely on the analysis of monetary aggregates, but will complement this analysis with a broadly based assessment of the outlook for future price developments. On the one hand, the chosen strategy will, in my view, ensure as great a degree of continuity as possible in relation to the existing strategies of national central banks in the euro area. On the other hand, due consideration has simultaneously been given to the unique situation created by the transition to Monetary Union, in which a possibly growing international role of the euro is but one element.      3. What are the prospects for international policy co-ordination between central banks? Are target zones for the key currencies conceivable, or even desirable?     The ECB, acting on behalf of the ESCB, is already beginning to play a major role in international fora, such as those at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the OECD and in a G7 and G10 context, and I expect this role to grow considerably in significance once the ESCB is operational. In all fora, the ECB's role will be to contribute to the international policy discussions from the perspective that price stability in the euro area is its prime objective. At the same time, the ECB will seek to make the best contribution it can to stable international developments. In particular, the introduction of the euro will reduce the number of major currency blocs in the global financial system. In principle, this should simplify the exchange of views on financial issues at the global level. Each of the main partners \\x96 the United States, the euro area and Japan \\x96 will be in a position to speak for a comparatively large economic area and will be similarly vulnerable to possible consequences of instability. They may thus have a greater incentive to take on a share of the responsibility for helping to maintain a stable global environment. On the question of exchange rates and target zones, I would like to state clearly that, in its monetary strategy, the ESCB does not have an exchange rate target. Nor do the United States and Japan. An exchange rate target for an area as large and relatively closed as that of the euro area could easily conflict with the maintenance of price stability and could, therefore, not be sustainable. According to our monetary policy strategy, the exchange rate of the euro will thus be an outcome, rather than the objective, both of the economic, monetary and other policies pursued in the euro area, and of cyclical developments in the euro area and abroad. It will be monitored as one of the indicators of monetary policy and as a source of potential changes in the price level in the euro area. However, the exchange rate will play a far smaller role in the euro area than it has played in the Member States in the past. In line with the ESCB\\x92s approach to the euro exchange rate, the Ministers of Finance, who are ultimately responsible for the exchange rate policy of the euro, have agreed to issue so-called exchange rate orientations only in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of clear and persistent misalignments of the euro. This is apparently not the case at this juncture. Nor is there any indication that such misalignments will be unavoidable in the future. In particular, the fact that our strategy does not include any exchange rate target vis-à-vis the US dollar does not imply that the euro/dollar rate will be unstable or volatile, or that the ESCB is against reasonably stable exchange rates. The pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and budgetary policies on both sides of the Atlantic would put in place one of the major prerequisites for a reasonably stable euro/dollar exchange rate. At the current juncture, the policy framework in both regions seems to bode well for the adoption of such policies. Absolute stability is, of course, impossible to guarantee and would not even be desirable, if the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles which are not fully synchronised.  \"]\n",
      "['1998-11-18', 'Christian Noyer', 'The euro in the global financial market', 'Christian Noyer Vice-President of the European Central Bank Dinner speech at the European Banking Seminar organised by Julius Bär \"The global financial market and the euro: strategies and prospects\" Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 1998', '  The euro in the global financial market   Christian Noyer Vice-President of the European Central Bank Dinner speech at the European Banking Seminar organised by Julius Bär \"The global financial market and the euro: strategies and prospects\" Frankfurt am Main, 18 November 1998   I.   The countdown is running. We are only 43 days away from the beginning of Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Starting conditions for a smooth launch of the euro remain favourable, while the wave of bad news on external economic developments has faded away and global financial markets have tended to stabilise over the last few weeks. A high degree of domestic macroeconomic convergence among designated participants has led to sound economic fundamentals throughout the euro area. Inflation remains subdued (1.0% in September 1998), the outlook for inflation in the near term is generally favourable and persistent deflation is very unlikely. Economic growth is supported by domestic demand. Nominal and real long-term interest rates are close to historical lows providing a benign investment climate. Moreover, even before its birth, the euro has proven its ability to protect the euro area against tensions in international financial markets and the euro area has benefited from \"safe haven\" capital inflows. However, downside risks caused by external factors cannot be ignored. The slow recovery from last year\\'s financial crisis in Asia, the strong contraction of economic activity in Russia, the protracted economic downturn in Japan and tensions in Brazil and certain other Latin American countries inevitably exert dampening effects on global economic activity. And the consensus view is that the euro area will also be affected to some extent. In this context, concerns have been raised that the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) might be too complacent towards these external events and their potential systemic risks or lack the willingness to co-operate at the international level in containing such risks. These criticisms are unfounded. You can be assured that the ESCB is fully aware of the seriousness of these developments and their possible adverse effects. However, we also know that activism has never been good counsel. With regard to the current stage of the world economy, it appears all the more important to ensure a successful implementation of EMU. This will create the basis for further sound economic growth in the euro area, thereby also providing a positive impact for the world economy as a whole. The introduction of the euro is a quantum leap forwards in European integration and the most profound change in the international monetary system since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. As of 1 January, the ESCB will run the monetary policy for a group of eleven countries, almost 300 million people and a GDP which is roughly 80% of that of the United States. It is therefore understandable that a great deal of attention is being shown, notably among financial market participants, in the prospective role of the euro as an international currency in its various functions as an investment, transaction, vehicle and reserve currency. In the following, I will try to shed some light on the developing role of the euro in the global financial market. First of all, I should like to examine the implications of the introduction of the euro for private portfolio management. Second, I will discuss the potential use of the euro as a transaction and vehicle currency in the private sector. Third, I will focus on the possible effects on the public sector\\'s use of the euro as a reserve and an anchor currency. Finally, since the future international role of the euro will also depend on its expected internal and external value, I will turn briefly to the role of the euro\\'s exchange rate in the conduct of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy .   II.   To start with, I should like to discuss the likely response of the private sector to the introduction of the euro. At present, the US dollar is the dominant investment currency in the global capital market. The share of dollar-denominated international bonds and notes amounted to 46% at the end of June 1998, followed by the Japanese yen (11%), whereas all euro area currencies taken together accounted for 24%. A similar pattern can also be found for the denomination structure of international bank assets and liabilities. A major factor in the potential attractiveness of the euro as an investment currency will be the emergence of a large and integrated financial market in the euro area. The introduction of the euro will foster the growth of broader and more integrated euro area money and securities markets by removing currency-related fragmentation and inducing the establishment of uniform market standards. However, the euro area money market is likely to be more fully integrated than the bond market, at least in the early stages of EMU. At the short end of the yield curve, the necessary conditions for the creation of a broad, deep and liquid European money market will be met from the very outset. First, the operational framework for the single monetary policy relies mainly on market-based monetary policy instruments providing a favourable environment for trading activities of financial market participants. Open market operations based on reverse transactions with a broad spectrum of counterparties, as the major policy instrument, will foster money market integration. Second, the integration will technically be supported by the implementation of the European payment system TARGET (which stands for Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer). This system consists of the inter-linked real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of participating countries and, within certain limits, the non-euro area countries. It provides a major component of the financial infrastructure of the future euro area. It is designed not only to ensure a common overnight rate throughout the euro area and a smooth settlement of cross-border payments in the euro area, but also to reduce systemic risks that might arise from settlement failures. Even today, money market rates and swap yields on maturities ranging from one week to two years are almost identical in the future euro area countries. The introduction of the euro will also have favourable implications for bond markets as the euro will increase market liquidity, broaden the range of maturities and potentially offer a greater variety of financial products. Current pricing and ratings for bonds issued by euro area governments already show a significant degree of convergence, indicating that government bonds of the future euro area are increasingly being dealt with as a common class of assets. However, in the absence of a single issuer such as the US Government for the dollar area, capital markets are likely to remain more fragmented at the long end of the yield curve than at the short end. This holds true, despite the re-denomination of outstanding government debt into euro on 1 January 1999. Some of the credit spreads between euro government bonds issued by different national euro area treasuries are likely to prevail even after the elimination of exchange risk premia. These spreads may, at least to some extent, reflect differences in credit assessments based on the respective fiscal position of governments in the euro area, including future pension obligations. They may also reflect differences in market liquidity of benchmark issues, and in market practices and conventions. Turning to private sector issuers, increasingly integrated money and government bond markets may stimulate the emergence of commercial paper and corporate bond markets in the euro area. Increasing economies of scale, narrower bid-ask spreads, lower hedging costs for debt securities issued by private firms and a more competitive underwriting activity are likely to provide incentives for corporations to issue their own securities instead of borrowing from banks. In the same vein, investors in search for higher yields will find such securities attractive. This market segment might expand to an increasing extent in the euro area. Likewise, on the deposit side, a rapidly developing private repo market in euro could become a serious alternative to bank deposits for large investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. The development of such new market segments is likely to attract both international investors and borrowers. Finally, other factors influencing internationalisation are the risk, return and diversification characteristics of the euro. In short, the attractiveness of the euro, which will foster low market interest rates all along the yield curve, and provide for a benign investment climate, will be enhanced by the stability-oriented monetary policy guaranteed by a highly independent ECB and by sound fiscal policies throughout the euro area.   III.   Let me now turn to the role of the euro as a transaction and vehicle currency for cross-border transactions outside the euro area. That role will depend on its potential for becoming a means of payment in foreign trade and foreign exchange markets. In this context, relevant factors are the weight of the euro area in the global economy and the size of its foreign trade and financial linkages, since increasing economies of scale will play an important role in promoting the use of the euro. Today, the US dollar is the world\\'s by far most important transaction and vehicle currency. Its share in all transactions (spot plus derivatives transactions) in foreign exchange markets is one and a half times higher than that of the euro area currencies. With respect to the invoicing of international trade, estimates suggest that in the early 1990s about one half of global exports were invoiced in US dollars, while roughly one third was denominated in euro area currencies and only 5% in yen. Initially, following the introduction of the euro, the euro market share in foreign trade and foreign exchange transactions will decline as a result of the purely mechanical effect of the elimination of intra-European trade which accounts for about 60% in 1997 of the total external trade of the future euro area countries. However, notably in respect of trade, the expected decline is likely to be a short-term development. In a medium-term perspective, this decline is likely to be offset, as far as international trade flows both between the euro area and foreign countries and between non-euro area residents are concerned. It is worth noting that according to recent press reports, some companies in non-euro area countries in Europe, such as Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, are considering switching wholly or partly to transactions in euro. However, the use of the US dollar as an international currency in the goods and financial markets is likely to remain predominant, at least for a certain period of time, since it is less related to trade shares than to the convenience of using one standard for pricing, in particular in commodity markets with homogenous goods and a large number of market participants. In this context, it is of interest to note that it took several decades before the US dollar, as the currency of the largest economy in the world since the end of the last century, became the world\\'s key vehicle currency, replacing the pound sterling.   IV.   So far, I have mainly discussed the implications for the international use of the euro from the perspective of the private sector. Although private portfolio flows will presumably be the dominant factor in the internationalisation of the euro, central bank demand for euro in the context of their official reserve portfolio management is likely to play a significant role. At present, the US dollar remains the most important reserve currency worldwide. At the end of 1996, the share of dollar-denominated official reserves amounted to 64%, while euro area currencies accounted for one-quarter and the yen for 6%. As regards official reserve holdings in the future euro area, it is to be noted that there will be a fall in the euro\\'s share of world reserves, since a large part of euro area countries\\' reserves which were previously held as foreign assets (primarily Deutsche Mark) will become domestic euro assets after the entry into Stage Three. As far as the future share of the euro in overall official reserves is concerned, it seems plausible to expect that central banks of non-euro area countries will re-assess their reserve management strategy in light of the better global diversification opportunities offered by this new currency. Moreover, the euro might also assume a greater role as an anchor currency in other European countries which, formally or informally, intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a (trade-weighted) basket of currencies including the euro as a large component. This may hold true not only of the countries participating in the newly established exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) but also of transition countries in central and eastern Europe, possibly of non-EU Mediterranean countries as well as of Switzerland and Norway. Finally, the euro may increasingly become part of the total foreign currency reserves held by Asian central banks to the extent that they take the opportunity to diversify their reserves. Whether this will happen, however, depends crucially on the confidence in the ECB\\'s monetary policy and the euro\\'s stability.   V.   I will now turn briefly to the role that the euro\\'s exchange rate will play in the conduct of the ECB\\'s monetary policy. At its meeting in December 1997 in Luxembourg, the European Council underlined in its conclusions that the exchange rate of the euro will be heavily influenced by economic fundamentals of the euro area relative to those of other countries. In broad terms, this implies that the exchange rate should be seen as the outcome of all relevant economic policies rather than as an objective to be set independently. Hence, the euro exchange rate will clearly not play an instrumental role in the conduct of the euro area monetary policy, as was the case in the ERM. Underlying this position is of course Article 105 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, according to which the ESCB\\'s primary objective is to maintain price stability, irrespective of the exchange rate system agreed upon under the Treaty. For the ESCB, this objective will have pre-eminence over all other policy objectives, including the exchange rate. This is in line with the monetary policy strategy chosen for Stage Three of EMU, which was presented to the public a month ago. It assigns a prominent role to money, with a reference value for the growth of a monetary aggregate. The reference value for the growth of the monetary aggregate will be derived in a manner, which is consistent with - and will serve to maintain - price stability throughout the euro area. Moreover, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for future price developments will play a major role. Finally, the Governing Council of the ECB has defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HIPC) for the euro area of less than 2% which is to be maintained over the medium term. To make it quite clear: both persistent inflation and deflation are incompatible with this definition of price stability. The European Council also concluded in December last year that \"general orientations\" for the exchange rate policy of the euro area may be formulated only in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of a clear misalignment of the euro which is likely to persist. This implies that, in normal circumstances and in the absence of formal exchange rate arrangements between the euro and other major currencies, the ESCB will be in charge of the day-to-day exchange rate policy in the euro area. But the ESCB will, of course, monitor exchange rate developments as part of its overall assessment of a broad range of economic and financial indicators which are relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. If the Governing Council of the ECB takes the view that the external value of the euro is out of line with fundamentals, it may take corrective action. In other words, we will not pursue a policy of \"benign neglect\" with respect to exchange rate developments.    VI.   At the end of my speech, let me quote Mark Twain by saying that predictions should be avoided, particularly those about the future. Specifically, that holds true of assessments of the future international role of the euro. Current conditions in the global financial markets can only be seen as a rough indication of the direction and magnitude of future developments. However, there is little doubt that the introduction of the euro will lead to a far-reaching restructuring of the euro area financial markets, which will make them more efficient and internationally competitive. Nevertheless, over a medium-term horizon, confidence in the future internal and external stability of the euro will play a crucial role. In this respect, I am convinced that the unequivocal mandate conferred upon the ESCB to maintain price stability and the ESCB\\'s institutional framework, which ensures a high degree of independence, will foster the future international use of the euro in its various functions. The ESCB takes a neutral stance towards the development of the international role of the euro. It is not our objective to stimulate, or to hinder the development of this role. However, the more successful the ECB is in achieving its primary objective of maintaining price stability, the more will the international role of the euro be \"automatically\" fostered. In order to be successful in ensuring a stable price environment without being overburdened, the monetary policy of the ESCB needs to be supported by sound fiscal policies, structural reforms and responsible wage behaviour at the national level. The relatively favourable domestic conditions currently prevailing in Europe should be used to further reduce structural imbalances in government budgets, also with a view to creating greater policy flexibility over the whole business cycle. In this context, the slowing down of fiscal consolidation in some euro area countries since 1997 could prove to be counterproductive. As regards unemployment, which is largely structural in nature, only measures intended to improve the working of the labour and goods markets at the national level are bound to be effective. Let me close by saying that changes in the structure of the international monetary system will take time to materialise, as past experience has shown in the case of the US dollar vis-à-vis the pound sterling. I am nevertheless rather confident that the euro will indeed play a major role in the international financial arena as a result of both the stability-oriented monetary policy conducted by the ECB and the weight of the euro area in the global economy. At any rate, we at the ECB will of course spare no efforts and pains to make sure that our new currency becomes a success story.  ']\n",

Duisenberg', 'The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the European\\t\\t\\t\\tSystem of Central Banks and the international role of the euro', 'Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Economic Club of New York on 12 November 1998 in New York', '  The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the European System of Central Banks and the international role of the euro   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Economic Club of New York on 12 November 1998 in New York On 1 January 1999 - in only fifty days\\' time - Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will commence in Europe. The introduction of the euro will mark a tremendous achievement, the culmination of more than a decade of preparation and convergence. But, in many ways, the greatest challenges and opportunities will still lie ahead. Any momentous event - and surely EMU qualifies as such - is likely to have profound implications both for Europe itself and for the wider international economy.      The ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy    First and foremost, the introduction of the euro offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability throughout the eleven countries that comprise the euro area. By ensuring that prices throughout the euro area can be kept stable over time, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will be laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and improved employment prospects in Europe as a whole.  Today, before turning to the implications of the euro for the international economy, I should like to describe how we intend to meet our objective of maintaining price stability in the unique circumstances attending the introduction of the euro. At the heart of our approach is the \"stability-oriented\" monetary policy strategy which was recently adopted by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) and presented to the general public last month.  The establishment of EMU is a unique event. It may also lead to changes in economic behaviour. People inside and outside the euro area may, for example, restructure their investment portfolios. The wage formation process may be affected by the introduction of the euro in future. Entrepreneurs will face additional competitive pressures which may have an impact on their price-setting behaviour. In other words and in general: the transmission of changes in interest rates, of monetary policy measures, may change to a certain extent with the start of Stage Three of EMU. This is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of the euro which had to be taken into account in the design of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy.  Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB has chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances existing at present. Given a natural desire to build on the success of national central banks (NCBs) in the euro area prior to Stage Three, the strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the existing strategies of NCBs. Nevertheless, the chosen strategy gives due consideration to the unique situation created by the transition to Monetary Union.  Given these specific circumstances, the Governing Council has decided that it would not be wise at the start of Stage Three to define a single intermediate target for the ESCB\\'s monetary policy. Instead, it has chosen a strategy combining elements of monetary targeting, as practised by the Deutsche Bundesbank, and elements of direct inflation targeting, as conducted by the Bank of England, for instance.  The ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent if we are to convince the general public both of our commitment to maintain price stability and of our ability to do so. We must be seen to be operating within a sound and coherent framework that leads to consistent and effective monetary policy decisions.  The Maastricht Treaty entrusts the ESCB with the primary objective of maintaining price stability. It does not, however, quantify this objective or stipulate how it should be achieved. A clear indication in quantitative terms of the objective of monetary policy will help build up the credibility of the new, single monetary policy of the euro area and will thereby increase its effectiveness.  The ESCB is an institution which is independent from political interference. In a democratic society, independence has to be accompanied by accountability. Transparency regarding the ultimate objective of monetary policy is one way of ensuring that the ESCB can be held accountable for its policies. The Governing Council of the ECB has, therefore, decided to publish a quantitative definition of price stability, with which the general public can sensibly judge its success in fulfilling the Treaty\\'s mandate.  In this context, the Governing Council agreed in October that \"price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\".  As I mentioned earlier, the Maastricht Treaty stipulates that the primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability. In addition, but without prejudice to this objective, the ESCB is required to support the general economic policies in the European Community. The choice of price stability as the primary objective is based on the view that this is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the creation of conditions conducive to durable income and employment growth. This conviction has been confirmed both by decades of experience and by a broad range of theoretical and empirical studies. In the longer term the achievement of price stability and the creation of sustainable employment are fully compatible. Indeed, price stability is one of the longer-term conditions for the achievement of other economic policy objectives of a higher order, such as sustainable economic growth and full employment. By fulfilling its primary objective of maintaining price stability, the ESCB will automatically also support the general economic policies in the European Community which are aimed at achieving the aforementioned objectives, namely growth and employment.  If production, inflation and employment all move in the same direction in the shorter term, as is the case in some business cycles, monetary policy can play some role in stabilising incomes and employment without endangering the pursuit of price stability. In such cases, ensuring price stability and, at the same time, supporting the general economic policies in the European Community does not create a policy dilemma. The various objectives all require a similar monetary policy stance. A policy dilemma only arises if prices, on the one hand, and incomes and employment, on the other, are moving in opposite directions in the shorter term, as may be the case whenever the business cycle is driven mainly by supply shocks. In that case, the Treaty clearly stipulates that monetary policy should give priority to maintaining or achieving price stability. Even then, however, monetary policy will generally still give due consideration to other objectives of economic policy by only gradually restoring price stability, especially if the deviation from price stability is substantial.  In this context, it should be emphasised that the European unemployment problem is not cyclical, but rather structural. Monetary policy cannot solve this problem. It can only contribute to creating the conditions needed to solve the problem by maintaining price stability. The main solution has to be provided by structural policies aimed at making European goods, services and labour markets operate more flexibly.  Although monetary policy may, in some circumstances, play some part in stabilisation policy, an activist monetary policy should be avoided. We simply do not know enough about the economic process for such a type of policy to be feasible. Monetary policy should take a medium-term perspective. Maintaining price stability in the medium -term ensures that the appropriate forward-looking and medium-term orientation is imparted to monetary policy. This will ensure that policy responses to threats to price stability are measured and deliberate. Such actions will not introduce unnecessary instability into the economy, while nevertheless ensuring that price stability is maintained. Let me now return to the quantitative definition of price stability.  As I have emphasised in the past, the definition we have announced reflects the aversion of the Governing Council to both inflation and deflation. The phrase \"below 2%\" clearly delineates the maximum rate of inflation deemed to be consistent with price stability. The wording \"year-on-year increases\" implies that persistent price decreases - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be considered to be consistent with price stability either. We did not announce a floor for inflation, because we know that the price index may include a measurement bias, but we do not know its magnitude.  The Governing Council explicitly announced that \"price stability is to be maintained over the medium term\". In doing so, it also acknowledged that price levels may be distorted by short-term factors - for example, by changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices - which cannot be controlled by monetary policy or by the ESCB.  In order to fulfil the Treaty mandate and maintain price stability in accordance with the published definition, the ESCB has adopted a stability-oriented monetary policy strategy which rests on two \"pillars\". The first pillar is a prominent role for money. This is deemed to be appropriate on account of the basically monetary origins of inflation over the longer term. In indication of the prominent role it attaches to money in the formulation of its monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB will announce a quantitative reference value for monetary growth in December.  The relationship between actual monetary growth and this pre-announced reference value will be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council. Wherever monetary growth deviates from the reference value, an explanation will be sought. If this explanation indicates a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react accordingly in order to address this threat. However, interest rates will not be changed in an almost mechanistic fashion in an attempt to correct deviations of money growth from the reference value over the short term. That is why we do not speak of a target for monetary growth, but rather of a reference value.  Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will not constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to take appropriate policy decisions. There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. Consequently, in parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, its strategy will also rest on a second \"pillar\". It will consist of a broadly-based assessment both of the outlook regarding price developments and of the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. This assessment will comprise a systematic analysis of all the other information on the economic and financial situation, ensuring that the Governing Council is as well informed as possible when making its monetary policy decisions.  On the basis of the strategy I have just outlined, the Governing Council will regularly inform the public about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area and about specific monetary policy decisions. The Governing Council will meet every fortnight. The first meeting in every month will be followed by a press conference. The ECB will frequently issue press releases and intends to publish a monthly bulletin as well as an annual report. We shall also regularly explain our policies in speeches and interviews, and I have already announced my acceptance of invitations to present them to the European Parliament four times a year.  Within this stability-oriented monetary policy framework, I am confident that the ESCB and the single monetary policy will succeed in maintaining price stability in the euro area, thereby laying the necessary foundations for Europe\\'s future economic stability and prosperity. However, it should be noted that, unless it enjoys the support of sound budgetary policies and responsible wage behaviour, monetary policy can sometimes only achieve price stability at a high cost in terms of lost output and employment. That is why I attach great importance to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, which was agreed by European governments. In the context of this Pact, it was agreed in the medium term to reduce government deficits to close to balance or even to create surpluses. This is intended to ensure sound budgetary policies and, at the same time, create room to allow automatic stabilisers to take effect.      The international role of the euro    Let me now turn to the second issue I should like to address today: the international role of the euro. Clearly, the introduction of the euro will have major implications in this field. The euro will be the currency of an economic area which will roughly equal the United States in terms of both its economic strength and the volume of its external trade. It will also rank second in the world to the United States in terms of the size of its capital market. The introduction of the euro will therefore have consequences for economies abroad and for the international capital markets. This will also be the case because the Deutsche Mark, which will be replaced by the euro, has already played an important international role in the past.  The size of an economy, its capital markets and external trade volume alone, however, are not perfect indicators of the international importance of a currency. By most measures, for example, the Japanese yen is of lesser international importance than the relative size of the Japanese economy and its capital market would suggest, while the opposite holds true for the US dollar.  The reason for which there is no strict relationship between the size of an economy and the international importance of its currency is to be found in the fact that the international role of a currency is a complex phenomenon. There are many uses for a currency in an international context. On the official side, they include its use as an anchor for exchange rate pegs, as a storage for foreign exchange reserves and as a vehicle currency for foreign exchange interventions. On the private side, they include its use as a quotation and vehicle currency for international trade, as the currency of denomination for financial assets and as a substitution currency in circulation abroad.  There are also very different groups of economic agents who decide on the international use of a currency. These include governments, central banks, institutional and private investors, corporations, and traders. In some cases, for example portfolio diversification, these agents may find it desirable to use different currencies; in others, such as commodity trading, they may prefer to use a single currency world-wide.  For the euro, this means that its international role cannot be a single one, but that there are several areas in which it could play a significant part. In the near future, such a role obviously seems to be more likely in areas where global currency diversification is desired, and less likely where global standardisation on a single currency has occurred.  While it is difficult and not always meaningful to try to predict the overall role which the euro will play internationally, it seems safe to assert that the role of the euro will be significant in a number of the areas outlined above. First, there are what one might call the \"static\" effects stemming from the changeover and the conversion of existing financial assets and liabilities to the euro. There are at least a dozen countries that have pegged their exchange rates to the Deutsche Mark or another euro area currency, and many of them will switch to pegging them to the euro. Foreign exchange reserves in euro area currencies currently account for about one-quarter of global reserves, and I could well imagine that many central banks in the world will, ultimately, hold at least an appropriate proportion in euro. It also seems likely that issuers of debt instruments and investors will hold onto any assets and liabilities which are converted to the euro. This should result from the smooth process of conversion to the euro which will ensure the continuity of the value of the ECU and will not, in itself, significantly affect the value of portfolios. These \"static\" effects alone are likely to give the euro an internationally recognised role.  Second, and potentially of far greater interest, there will be \"dynamic\" effects stemming from the new assets and liabilities acquired or issued in euro. Here, the creation of a large and liquid, integrated capital market will be the most important element in fostering this development. For short-term instruments, we will see this occurring in a deep and liquid European money market which will ensure a common overnight rate and very similar short-term interest rates for comparable instruments and credit risks. The development of this market will be strengthened by the ESCB\\'s operational framework for open market operations, which will be based primarily on reverse transactions and the implementation of the new TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer) system in all participating countries.  At the longer end of the spectrum of maturities, market integration will be jump-started by the redenomination of outstanding government debt in euro on 1 January 1999. Here, we are likely to see a further convergence of interest rates to narrower spreads, because the risk of possible exchange rate changes, the main cause of existing differences within the euro area, will no longer exist. The significant convergence of both short and long-term interest rates in the future euro area over the past few months is a clear indication of a development of this kind. However, some differences in longer-term interest rate spreads are likely to persist as a result of differences in the markets\\' assessment of counterparty risk and technical implications. Nevertheless, the segmentation of bond markets, which to some extent still exists in Europe and which is due to the use of different currencies, will be eliminated, and uniform market standards will clearly develop. In this context, it is interesting to note that between 1981 and 1995 the share of EU currencies in world-wide private portfolios is estimated to have risen from 13% to 37%, while the US dollar\\'s share fell from 67% to 40%. Although this process has slowed down somewhat in the 1990s, I would expect the introduction of the euro to lead to a continuation of this trend and, potentially, to accelerate it again.  Let me now address an important policy issue that has been raised in this context: what stance will the ESCB take with regard to the international role of the euro? At least three aspects can be distinguished: the role of the euro as an international currency, the exchange rate of the euro, and the role of the ECB in international co-operation and international institutions. I shall briefly summarise each of these aspects.  With regard to the role of the euro as an international currency, it must be borne in mind that the ESCB has a clear mandate, namely to maintain price stability in the euro area. Having an international currency would, of course, be of some advantage to the citizens of the euro area. At the same time, however, the conduct of monetary policy may sometimes become more complicated, if a significant proportion of the money stock is circulating outside the euro area. The ESCB will take a neutral stance. It will neither promote nor hinder the development of the euro as an international currency. The ESCB will accept the international role of the euro as it develops through market forces. There will be no deliberate policy of challenging the US dollar. To the extent that the ESCB is successful in maintaining price stability, however, it will also automatically foster the use of the euro as an international currency. The pace with which the role of the euro as an international currency will develop is hard to predict. If history were to provide a key, it will be a gradual process, but the possibility cannot be ruled out that it will happen quicker this time than is perhaps suggested by past experience.  A second policy aspect of the international role of the euro concerns the exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis so-called third currencies, such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen. In its monetary policy strategy, the ESCB does not specify a target for the exchange rate of the euro. The euro area will be a rather closed economy, in the same way as the United States. Pursuing a target for the euro exchange rate could easily compromise the maintenance of price stability. In line with the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy, the exchange rate of the euro will mainly be the outcome of the economic, monetary and other policies, as well as of cyclical developments in the euro area and in other countries. This does not mean that the exchange rate of the euro will be neglected. The exchange rate will definitely be monitored as one of the indicators of monetary policy. To the extent that its development has an impact on price developments in the euro area, it will be taken into account and a response given, if need be. In line with the ESCB\\'s approach to the euro exchange rate, the Ministers of Finance, who have ultimate responsibility for the exchange rate of the euro, have agreed only to issue so-called orientations for exchange rate policy in exceptional circumstances, such as a clear misalignment of the euro which is likely to persist.  The fact that our strategy does not provide for any target for the euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar does not imply that the euro/dollar rate will be unstable or volatile. The pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and budgetary policies on both sides of the Atlantic would put in place one of the major prerequisites for a stable euro exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar. At the current juncture, the policy framework in both the United States and Europe seems to bode well for the adoption of such policies. Absolute stability is, of course, impossible to guarantee and would not even be desirable, if the United States and the euro area were to go through business cycles which are not fully synchronised. This possibility cannot be ruled out, as even recent history has shown.  The third policy aspect of the international role of the euro which I should briefly like to discuss is the impact on international co-operation. I shall restrict my comments to the ECB. It is clear that a central bank which represents not only such a large economic area with such a large population (300 million), but also a currency which will increasingly circulate outside the euro area, will have an important international role to play. The ECB will not walk away from that role, but it will have to be modest and realistic. Its role will develop over time, and it will be required and willing to learn from experience, also from the experience of countries which have already played such a role for a far longer period of time. Even today, before it has actually started proper operations, the ECB is already participating at various levels in meetings of the G-7 and G-10 countries as well as in meetings at the Bank for International Settlements and the OECD. Its relations with the IMF are institutionally complex, because only countries are allowed to be members of the IMF, not central banks. In all likelihood, a pragmatic solution, which would give the ECB observer status, will be adopted.  The ECB\\'s international role will be guided by the fundamental view that price stability in the euro area is the best contribution it can make to a stable international monetary system. In addition, the ECB will, of course, stand ready to participate fully in and to contribute to international policy discussions, offering its expertise, when and where appropriate.  The ECB aims at maintaining good relations with other central banks across the world. It goes without saying that maintaining good relations with our larger counterparts, such as the Bank of Japan and, in particular, the Federal Reserve, is essential. This is not only in our own interest, but also in the interests of a prosperous world economy at large. I should like to conclude on an optimistic note. I am confident not only that the euro will become a stable currency, but also that the ECB and the Federal Reserve will build up the spirit of good co-operation which I have just mentioned.  ']\n",

Apart from the political motives behind the implementation of Monetary Union, the introduction of the euro will also have significant economic implications for the participating countries. In order to ensure the success of Monetary Union in supporting growth and employment, it is essential to maintain the credibility of the long-term stability of the euro. The credibility of a currency is built up on many elements, some of which are beyond the control of the central bank. In my presentation today, I intend mainly to discuss the building blocks which the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has on hand with respect to the establishment of a credible and successful monetary policy.   1. Institutional independence   A first fundamental building block for the establishment of credibility is the assurance that the central bank\\'s monetary policy decisions are independent from political pressures. This building block has already been enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty. The institutional set-up for the ESCB, ensures that the European Central Bank (ECB) and the participating national central banks will enjoy a very high degree of independence. All monetary policy decisions will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB, which comprises the Governors of the eleven participating national central banks and the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB, on the basis of one vote per person. Article 7 of the Statute of the ESCB explicitly forbids governments, or Community institutions, to instruct or seek to influence the ECB, the national central banks or any members of the decision-making bodies. However, a high degree of independence does not mean that the ESCB would not be accountable for its actions or that it would not be ready to discuss its analyses and monetary policy actions in public. This notwithstanding, it is important that the desire for accountability does not spill over into exerting political pressure on the central bank. Public accountability for the actions of the ESCB can best be achieved through transparency. This is, in fact, the second building block on which the ESCB\\'s monetary policy rests.   2. Unambiguous overall objective - transparency in strategy and action   For the credibility of the monetary policy, it is important that the overall objective is unambiguous, that the strategy to achieve this objective is transparent and that the policy actions are well explained. By following such a transparent approach, the central bank can directly promote the efficiency of monetary policy by fostering the right expectations among market participants with regard to what the monetary authorities hope to achieve. Hence, a predictable monetary policy may contribute to achieving stable prices with little friction and with the lowest interest rates possible. For these reasons, the ESCB has placed particular emphasis on transparency in its monetary policy framework. The ESCB will also place a great emphasis on explaining not only its assessment of economic developments and inflation prospects, but also the impact of this assessment on its monetary policy decisions. The primary objective of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy, as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, is to maintain price stability. In order to bring about absolute clarity as regards the primary objective, the Governing Council decided last month to define that it understands price stability \"as a year-on-year increase of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". This is a medium-term objective. In the short run, many factors beyond the scope of monetary policy-makers also have an impact on price movements. I should like to highlight, in particular, two important features of the definition of price stability; first, it relates to price developments \"for the euro area\". The single monetary policy will be guided by a euro area-wide perspective, and it can therefore not react to specific regional or national developments. Such specific regional or national developments will have to be tackled through fiscal and structural policy measures. Second, the ESCB\\'s definition of price stability does - contrary to what is claimed by some critics - provide for a lower boundary. The use of the word \"increase\" implies that the ESCB will be worried about deflation as well as about inflation. The adoption of a euro area-wide viewpoint will be a demanding and immediate challenge for the ESCB. This challenge requires the Governors of the national central banks and the members of the Executive Board to base their analyses, actions and decisions on the interests of the euro area as a whole, instead of pursuing national interests. Therefore, I strongly believe that it is a good idea not to publish the minutes and the voting positions of the Governing Council, because publication would dramatise differences in national opinions, which might lead to public pressure on individual members at the national level. To my mind, publishing the views and the voting positions of individual members is not essential for transparency. The approach chosen by the Governing Council allows it to act most effectively as a single body, promoting the interests of the euro area as a whole. The monetary policy strategy to be followed by the ESCB in the pursuit of its overall objective will consist of two key elements:     money will be assigned a prominent role, which will be indicated by the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate; and   there will also be a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area on the basis of a wide range of economic and financial indicators.     Critics have argued that the ESCB\\'s monetary policy would not sufficiently enhance transparency since the weight assigned to money, as compared to other indicators, is not clear from the outset. In this context, I would like to make two remarks. First, I should like to recall the environment in which the single monetary policy will operate as from the start of Stage Three. The move to Monetary Union may in itself give rise to structural changes and uncertainties, which would make it inappropriate to rely too heavily on a specific pre-defined monetary variable. These uncertainties relate, for example, to the way in which the transition to Monetary Union will affect economic behaviour as well as the institutional and financial structures in the euro area. They also relate to purely statistical issues. Even if money demand functions in the euro area have been very stable in the past, we cannot rely on the continuity of this stability in the new structure. My second remark is linked to the first one. The encompassing strategy adopted by the ESCB assigns a very important role to the development of the chosen monetary aggregate without implying a mechanical or automatic reaction to deviations from the reference value. When monetary policy decisions are made, the general price development prospects - based on very careful analysis - will also be taken into account. In practice, the choice of a monetary policy strategy should not be seen as a choice between fundamentally different theories on how best to conduct monetary policy. Instead, it should be seen as a realistic and balanced choice on how to present monetary policy decisions in a clear and consistent way. In this respect, the Governing Council intends to inform the public regularly and in detail about its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the context of the framework set for its monetary policy strategy. To this end, a press conference will be held once a month, as soon as possible after a meeting of the Governing Council. The ECB\\'s publications, in particular the monthly bulletin, will also play an important role in its regular communications to the general public.   3. Efficient and market-oriented implementation of monetary policy   A third important building block for the credibility of monetary policy is the assurance that the operational framework is designed in a way that allows monetary policy decisions to be implemented efficiently. The operational framework should be consistent with market principles and ensure an equal treatment of counterparties and financial systems across the euro area. Furthermore, the ESCB has placed great emphasis on the need to ensure that the operational framework is based on the principle of decentralisation in order not to disrupt established links between the national central banks and their counterparties. Monetary policy operations will therefore be conducted by the national central banks, while decision-making will take place centrally in the ECB\\'s decision-making bodies. In the implementation of monetary policy, all central banks make use of an operational target as a proxy for the desired monetary policy stance. The ESCB will rely on a short-term interest rate as its operational target, and it will use open market operations as its main monetary policy instrument. Open market operations are flexible and market-oriented; they have signalling functions, and they are used for managing the liquidity situation in the market. I do not wish to go into detail about the ESCB\\'s monetary policy tools and procedures. However, I should like to mention some of the main functions of the framework, which is very similar to the framework already used in most EU countries. As I have already said, open market operations will be the basic tool used in the implementation of monetary policy. The main refinancing operations will be regular liquidity-providing reverse transactions at weekly intervals with maturities of two weeks. These reverse transactions will be executed by the ESCB on the basis of tender procedures in which, in principle, all credit institutions established in the euro area may participate. These operations will provide the bulk of refinancing in the financial sector and they will be used both to manage the money market interest rates and to signal the stance of monetary policy. In addition to these two-week repo operations, the ESCB will conduct longer-term refinancing operations, which are liquidity-providing reverse transactions at monthly intervals with maturities of three months. They, too, will be based on tender procedures. These monthly repo operations will, as a rule, not be conducted with the intention of sending signals to the market or of managing market interest rates. The ESCB will, of course, also be able to carry out fine-tuning open market operations on an ad hoc basis with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates. For these operations, the ESCB will have a large number of instruments (collection of deposits, foreign exchange swaps, outright transactions, etc.) and procedures at its disposal, which it can use, where necessary, with only a limited set of counterparties. The ESCB will also have the possibility of conducting so-called structural operations. These operations will aim at affecting the longer-term liquidity position of the banking sector vis-à-vis the ESCB. A main instrument for these operations may be the issuance of debt certificates. Reverse and outright transactions might also be employed for this purpose. Another important structural tool is the ESCB\\'s minimum reserve system, which was designed with a view to fulfilling two main functions: first, the enlargement of the structural deficit in the money market, thereby increasing the banks\\' dependence on central bank credit, and, second, the stabilisation of money market interest rates through the use of an averaging mechanism. This latter feature will help absorb liquidity shocks, without the need for the ESCB to undertake frequent fine-tuning interventions in the money market. All credit institutions in the euro area will be required to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the national central banks. In order to prevent the minimum reserve system from imposing significant financial burdens on the banking sector, which might lead to a relocation of banking business to countries outside the euro area, the ESCB will remunerate reserve holdings at its two-week repo rate. In addition to the open market instruments and the structural tools, two standing facilities will be available. The interest rates on the standing facilities establish a corridor within which the market interest rate will move. In contrast to open market operations and structural tools, the standing facilities are used at the initiative of the market counterparties. The marginal lending facility will enable the counterparties automatically to cover any possible end-of-day liquidity needs at a rate of interest above the repo rate. Under normal circumstances, there will not be any credit limits or other restrictions on counterparties\\' access to the facility. The higher interest rate is expected to guide the use of this financing facility. The lower boundary of the interest rate corridor will be set by the deposit facility, which will enable market counterparties to hold a possible end-of-day liquidity surplus with the ESCB at a rate of interest below the repo rate.   4. The integration of payment systems   In order to ensure a harmonised implementation of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy throughout the euro area, it is important that a fully integrated euro area-wide money market is established as from the start of Stage Three of EMU. This is essential in order to avoid a segmentation of the money market interest rate according to the liquidity situation in national money markets. A precondition for the establishment of an integrated money market is the integration of national payment systems. For this reason, the ESCB has developed the so-called TARGET system, which will connect the national real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems throughout the euro area with one another. The TARGET system will be operational from the first day of Stage Three. The domestic settlement systems will operate in real time. This complies with a major objective of the central banks, which is to minimise the risks for participants and for the payment system as a whole. The TARGET system will be an essential element in the organisation of payments in Monetary Union. It will not have a monopoly, however. Other settlement systems will continue to exist or be set up around it. The TARGET system will handle large-value payments. Only operations which are linked directly to the conduct of the single monetary policy and in which the future ESCB is involved - either as the issuer of a payment instruction or as the beneficiary of a payment - will necessarily have to be routed via TARGET. For the remainder, the market will decide on the distribution of payments among the systems in place in Stage Three. There is nothing to prevent certain banks from continuing to use their correspondents\\' accounts. Furthermore, numerous net and end-of-day settlement systems will continue to operate in EU countries. In the context of TARGET, the ECB decided in July 1998 that non-euro area central banks of EU Member States will also be able to offer limited intraday liquidity in euro to their counterparties. It is an innovative arrangement, intended to smooth the future transition of the relevant EU Member States to the Monetary Union. This arrangement, which is subject to an agreement with the central banks concerned, should be seen as a very specific exception to the general rule approved by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries, that no central bank shall grant credit in a currency other than its own.    5. Concluding remarks   I have focused on the elements which are directly related to the ESCB. In these areas, I feel very confident that we are well prepared for the start of Monetary Union. But I should like to underline that the credibility of the single monetary policy also depends very heavily on another building block, namely the extent to which governments are prepared to pursue stability-oriented policies of fiscal discipline and to undertake essential structural reforms. Fiscal policy affects credibility in two ways. The first has to do with how well national fiscal policies cope with differences in the business cycle and in the monetary policy transmission mechanisms of the participating Member States. Under a single monetary policy, national fiscal policies need to be far more active and flexible than is necessary at present to deal successfully with country-specific growth and inflation differences. Both the room for manoeuvre needed at the national level and the Stability and Growth Pact explicitly demand that national public budgets are balanced and sound. The second aspect of fiscal policy is the overall degree of fiscal policy discipline in the euro area. The maintenance of price stability and subdued inflation expectations in a low interest rate environment will be more easily achieved if fiscal policy is disciplined in the euro area as a whole.

A single monetary policy will be adopted for the entire euro area - a continent-wide zone of eleven sovereign states and almost 300 million people.  The advent of the euro offers great opportunities for Europe and Europeans. Transaction costs will be reduced. Pricing will become more transparent between European countries, encouraging greater competition and innovation in goods and financial markets. A truly single market will be created.  Above all, though, Monetary Union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain price stability throughout the eleven countries that will comprise the euro area from 1 January 1999. I am convinced that by meeting the Treaty mandate and fulfilling the unambiguous commitment of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintaining price stability we shall ensure that the single monetary policy makes the greatest possible contribution towards raising the standard of living of Europe\\'s citizens and improving growth and employment prospects. Price stability, consequently, is at the core of the \"stability culture\" that we are creating in Europe.  Today, I should like to describe how we intend to meet our primary objective in the unique - and potentially difficult - circumstances attending the birth of the euro. At the heart of our approach is the \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\" recently adopted by the Governing Council and announced to the public last month.  First and foremost, this monetary policy strategy is designed to ensure that the Governing Council is presented with the information it requires to make effective monetary policy decisions. The Council must act in a forward-looking and pre-emptive manner, changing interest rates to contain inflationary or deflationary pressures before such trends become entrenched.  Monetary policy is most effective when it is credible, that is, when the public is convinced that monetary policy will successfully maintain price stability over the medium term. Indeed, aside from enjoying your Irish hospitality, bolstering this conviction is the main purpose of my speech. Reassuring you and the wider public of the Governing Council\\'s commitment to price stability - and thereby building up the credibility of our new \"stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\" - will not only make my own job easier over the coming years. It will also increase the overall benefits of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole.  Speeches such as this are important. They illustrate the commitment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to openness and accountability in its decision-making. Openness and accountability are necessary complements to the independence of the ESCB, on which the credibility of the single monetary policy rests. Moreover, the monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent so that there is no confusion or ambiguity about the objective of monetary policy and how this objective will be achieved.  To this end, the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented strategy has been designed and presented in a very straightforward, realistic and, if I may say so, honest way. These features are central to clarity and transparency. They complement the many other efforts we have made - and will continue to make - to ensure that our communication with the public is open and transparent. Statements will be released and press conferences, including question and answer sessions, will be held immediately following Governing Council meetings. Regular monthly publications will be produced by the ECB. Discussion papers and technical analysis by the ECB staff will be published for professional review and scientific assessment. In all these regards, the ESCB is exceeding the reporting requirements laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, which are already among the most stringent applicable to any central bank.  Furthermore, in these articles and other presentations, we shall address various economic issues facing Europe, not least the issue of the high level of unemployment. In doing so, we shall make the best possible use of the knowledge of experts throughout the ESCB and ensure that this expertise is available to the wider public and the policy-making community.  In this context, let me emphasise that the Governing Council of the ECB is very concerned about the unacceptably high rate of unemployment in the euro area. However, an inflationary monetary policy would not solve Europe\\'s serious unemployment problem. On the contrary, an inflationary policy would not only unacceptably flout the Maastricht Treaty; a Treaty, let me remind you, that has been ratified by all the Member States of the European Union and endorsed by the public in referenda in several countries, including Ireland. An inflationary monetary policy would almost certainly lead to higher unemployment in the medium run, as long-term interest rates would rise and the benefits of price stability would be lost. Such a policy would therefore be entirely counterproductive. Let me be very clear: in the interest of all European citizens, the Governing Council is determined to protect price stability. The ESCB\\'s independence is a means to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Only by preserving price stability and thereby creating the stable environment required for continued higher employment and growth, can the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) serve the public and address the public\\'s understandable concerns.  In describing the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy today, I shall emphasise the twin principles of clarity and transparency that are vital in order to establish the credibility - and therefore ensure the success - of the single monetary policy.  Monetary Union is a unique event. It is likely to prompt considerable changes in economic behaviour and the institutional structure. These changes will be to the benefit of Europe\\'s citizens, not least as the benefits of price stability are reaped. Nonetheless the inevitable and not totally unpredictable changes in behaviour prompted by the introduction of the euro create uncertainty. This uncertainty will complicate the task of implementing the single monetary policy.  Against this background, the ECB Governing Council has chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that it faces at present. Given a natural desire to build on the success of national central banks in bringing inflation down to its current low level during the convergence process, the strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the existing strategies of the national central banks (NCBs) of the participating Member States. Nevertheless, the chosen strategy takes into account to the extent necessary the unique situation created by the transition to Monetary Union.  I shall proceed by describing the three main elements of the stability-oriented strategy. First, I shall discuss the quantitative definition of the ESCB\\'s primary objective, namely price stability. Second, I shall outline the prominent role played by money in the overall strategy. Third, I shall describe the analysis of a wide range of other financial and economic indicators that will enter the policy discussion. Finally, I shall conclude by arguing that the stability-oriented strategy adopted by the ESCB is, in the present circumstances, both clearer and more transparent than any of the alternatives. In consequence, I am confident of its future success.       The quantitative definition of price stability     The Maastricht Treaty assigns the ESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability. In the interest of accountability, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to publish a quantitative definition of price stability, against which its success in fulfilling the Treaty\\'s mandate can be sensibly judged by the public.  In this context, at its October meeting the Governing Council of the ECB agreed that \"price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\".  In this way, the Governing Council has clearly and unambiguously defined its objective. If and when we do not meet this objective, we are obliged to explain why this is the case and what we are going to do about it. Let me emphasise the over-riding priority we attach to this objective. This priority is not only a consequence of our legal obligations under the Treaty. It is also rooted in our belief - supported by both decades of experience and a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research - that maintaining price stability in the euro area is a pre-requisite for a sustainable and lasting improvement in the standard of living of Europe\\'s citizens and can lay the foundation for improving growth and employment prospects in the future.  The definition we have published is clear. In particular, a specific price index is identified with which to assess the maintenance of price stability. The HICP for the euro area was chosen because it is both sufficiently harmonised across the different countries of the euro area at the start of Stage Three and consistent with the public\\'s usual focus on consumer prices.  Using the index \"for the euro area\" highlights that euro area-wide developments, instead of specific national or regional factors, will be the only determinants of decisions regarding the single monetary policy.  As I have emphasised in the past, this definition signals the aversion of the Governing Council to both inflation and deflation. The phrase \"below 2%\" clearly delineates the rate of inflation in the HICP deemed consistent with price stability. The wording \"year-on-year increases\" implies that decreases in the HICP - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be considered consistent with price stability.  The Governing Council also announced that \"price stability is to be maintained over the medium term\". In doing so, it realistically acknowledged that disturbances to the price level can occur in the short run - for example, those caused by changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices - that cannot be controlled by monetary policy of the ESCB. Such factors may lead to occasional falls in the HICP, or occasional increases above 2%. These are quite normal and consistent with a meaningful definition of price stability. By focusing on the medium term, the ESCB\\'s monetary policy will ensure that these transitory deviations from the definition do not become sustained over the medium term.  By maintaining price stability over the medium term, the appropriate forward-looking and medium-term orientation is imparted to monetary policy. This will ensure that policy reactions to threats to price stability are measured and deliberate. Such actions will not introduce unnecessary instability or uncertainty into the economy, while nevertheless ensuring that price stability - and the attendant benefits - are maintained.      The prominent role of money in the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy    Let me now turn to the role money will play in the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.  Ultimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Assigning a prominent role to money within the overall stability-oriented strategy therefore guarantees that the monetary origins of inflation will not be neglected in the regular economic and financial analysis driving monetary policy decisions. Moreover, money is a visible \"nominal anchor\" for monetary policy that will help to stabilise the public\\'s medium-term inflation expectations, enhancing the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy.  To signal the prominent role attached to money, the Governing Council of the ECB will announce a quantitative reference value for monetary growth. In this regard, some commentators have assumed that the ESCB has adopted a conventional monetary target, but simply called it by a different name. However, before announcing a formal intermediate monetary target, certain conditions have to be met. These requirements have been met in the past in several euro area countries, and successful monetary targeting strategies have been pursued. However, one must recognise that, at present, the evidence as to whether these technical preconditions will be satisfied for the euro area as a whole in Stage Three is inevitably sparse. Monetary Union will cause changes in the financial system and economic behaviour, as ten different currency zones are merged into the single euro area. As I mentioned in my introduction, most of these changes will be of great benefit to individuals and firms in Europe. However, these behavioural and institutional changes are likely to change the relationship between money, interest rates and prices that has been observed in the past.  Consequently, a realistic alternative to a monetary target - that is, the reference value for monetary growth - will be announced. As I mentioned earlier, this reference value ensures as far as possible continuity with successful monetary strategies pursued in the euro area in the past. Nevertheless, it is a different approach that reflects the special circumstances facing the ESCB at the start of Stage Three.  This reference value will have two key features:     first, it will be derived in a manner that is clearly consistent with - and serves the purpose of - price stability;   second, it will be constructed such that, in the absence of special factors or other distortions, deviations of monetary growth from the reference value will signal risks to price stability.    The relationship between actual monetary growth and the pre-announced reference value will therefore be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council. Where deviations occur, an explanation will be sought. If this explanation points towards a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react appropriately in order to address this threat. However, in contrast to the reaction that would normally follow under a conventional monetary targeting regime, interest rates will not be changed in an attempt to correct deviations of money growth from the reference value over the short term.  The Governing Council would not wish to react in a mechanistic fashion to monetary developments, precisely because the signals implied by the money data could be scrambled by the technical uncertainties I have mentioned. By announcing a reference value and openly explaining how it will be used, the Governing Council is presenting its monetary policy strategy to the public in a way that reflects the manner in which it discusses policy itself. This is the essence of transparency.  A number of issues remain to be finalised with regard to the quantitative reference value for monetary growth. First, the broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will be announced has to be defined. Second, the reference value for monetary growth for 1999 will have to be derived and published. Progress on these two important issues is well under way and I anticipate a final announcement by the Governing Council in December.       A broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area     Although the monetary data contain information vital to monetary policy-making, monetary developments alone will not, of course, constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to enable appropriate policy decisions to be taken. In the ESCB\\'s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, money is accorded a prominent - but not an exclusive - role.  There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic and financial indicators. Consequently, in parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area will also be undertaken. This assessment will systematically analyse all the other information about the economic and financial situation, ensuring that the Governing Council is as well-informed as possible when making its monetary policy decisions.  Outside the ESCB, some commentators have labelled this broadly-based assessment an \"inflation forecast\". Failure to publish \"the\" inflation forecast is seen by some as contrary to the principle of transparency. I am afraid that both views are flawed. Allow me to explain why.  While it is true that accurate forecasts can contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy, the ESCB should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy of its internal forecasts. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability in the medium term should be used by the public to judge the success of the ESCB\\'s policies. Consequently, the publication of a forecast is only important in so far as it helps to achieve price stability through increasing the clarity and transparency of the policy-making process. In this regard, there are some important problems with publishing a single \"official inflation forecast\".  Relying on a single forecast that attempts to summarise all the information available from a wide range of indicators would be misguided. The Governing Council will not wish to be presented with a single number to which it will have to react mechanistically, if at all. In contrast, the Governing Council will want to know the economic reasons behind the projected risks to price stability. The appropriate monetary policy response to a threat to price stability will depend on the nature of the threat. The Governing Council can only understand the nature of the risk if it is presented with a full set of data. From these data, it can attempt - with the help of various staff analyses - to identify the nature of the disturbance to price stability. Having identified the threat, an appropriate policy response can be selected and implemented.  Even with the best intentions, making an inflation forecast requires numerous subjective judgements about developments in the economy. Adjustments will need to be made to forecasts to allow for the behavioural and institutional changes caused by the transition to Stage Three. Even purely \"model-based\" forecasts reflect the preferences of those who constructed the models. Against this background, publishing an inflation forecast would obscure rather than clarify what the Governing Council is actually doing. The public would be presented with a single number intended to summarise a thorough and comprehensive analysis of a wide range of indicator variables. However, such a summary would inevitably be simplistic. Moreover, because publishing a single inflation forecast would be likely to suggest that monetary policy reacts mechanistically to this forecast, publication might mislead the public and therefore run counter to the principle of clarity.  The publication of an inflation forecast might be problematic in other ways. If the ESCB were to publish a projection based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates, then, when inflationary or deflationary pressures arose, the projection might be interpreted as suggesting that price stability is actually in jeopardy. However, this would be very misleading. The Governing Council of the ECB is fully committed to the maintenance of price stability according to its published definition and would change monetary policy in order to address and contain the threat to price stability. However, the publication of the forecast itself might introduce an independent destabilising effect into private inflation expectations, inadvertently undermining the credibility of the single monetary policy, making price stability harder to maintain and reducing the overall benefits of doing so. As I have said in the past, under certain circumstances the publication of the inflation forecast itself may lead to some form of implicit indexation of wages, imparting a costly self-sustaining momentum to such forecasts.  If the ESCB were to publish an inflation forecast that incorporated the effects of its policy changes, rather than assuming that monetary policy was unchanged, then it would inevitably forecast price stability over the medium term. This follows from the unambiguous commitment of the Governing Council to meeting its primary objective of maintaining price stability. Publishing such a forecast might be reassuring, but it would not be very informative.  Clearly, the Governing Council could have decided to announce some form of inflation forecast and justify policy decisions by reference to it. Interest rate increases or decreases could then be explained on the basis that the inflation forecast pointed to threats to price stability. However, this presentation of monetary strategy to the public is likely to involve a circular argument. For example, interest rate increases would be justified on the basis that the inflation forecast pointed to an inflation rate higher than that consistent with price stability. However, critical observers might soon argue that the inflation forecast was above the target precisely because there was a perceived need to raise interest rates. Simply publishing a forecast does not explain why interest rates need to be changed. Moreover, as I have said, simply presenting a forecast to the public does not explain how the conclusion that a rate rise is required has been reached. On both grounds, publishing the forecast does not enhance the transparency and clarity of the strategy.  The strategy we have chosen at the ESCB avoids this danger. Based on this strategy, the Governing Council will inform the public regularly of its assessment of the monetary, economic and financial situation in the euro area. Moreover, when policy decisions are made, the reasoning behind specific decisions - including the economic rationale according to which judgements have been made - will be communicated to the public. By presenting the analysis that is actually driving the policy decisions, the ESCB is being both clear - since this analysis is informative about policy changes - and transparent - since the presentation to the public will reflect the type of discussion I expect to occur in the Governing Council itself.       Conclusion     In the present circumstances, the Governing Council has decided that following any mechanical policy rule to determine monetary policy in the euro area would be inappropriate. Putting \"all our eggs in one basket\" would be especially dangerous at the start of Stage Three, given the uncertainties that we face. Indeed, a mechanistic approach is unlikely to produce good policy decisions under any circumstances. To pretend otherwise to the public would be misleading and dangerous.  Nevertheless, the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent if we are to convince the public of our commitment to maintaining price stability and our ability to do so. We must be seen to be operating in a solid and coherent framework that leads to consistent and effective monetary policy decisions.  The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB offers just such a framework. Having been designed to respect the principles of clarity and transparency, I am confident that this strategy will be successful. By maintaining price stability in the euro area, the ESCB will thus lay part of the necessary foundation for Europe\\'s future economic stability and prosperity.   ']\n",
      "['1998-11-06', 'Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa', 'The housing finance markets and EMU', 'Speech delivered by Dr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Annual General Meeting of the European Mortgage Federation on 6 November 1998 in Brussels', '  The housing finance markets and EMU   Speech delivered by Dr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Annual General Meeting of the European Mortgage Federation on 6 November 1998 in Brussels   Introduction   I should like to thank you for inviting the European Central Bank to this Conference. The Conference offers an excellent opportunity to assess the developments which could occur in the special segment of the financial market represented by housing finance as a result of the introduction of the euro. Developments in the field of housing finance are of great importance, in the first instance, for the banking systems and households, since it is a field which accounts for a major proportion of credit institutions\\' assets and for the bulk of private households\\' debt. However, the issues involved are of considerable interest also to central banks, including the European Central Bank, because the level of indebtedness and mortgage interest rates as well as other terms and conditions of housing loans are among the key factors which influence the responsiveness of the household sector to monetary policy. In general, it is widely recognised that the introduction of the euro, together with the single market legislation relating to financial services, provides an opportunity to create a more competitive and efficient banking industry, as well as more integrated and liquid capital markets in Europe. Indeed, competition has already increased considerably in several areas of the financial system as a result of a number of fundamental driving forces for change - internationalisation, technological progress, diversification of savings portfolios - to name but a few. However, the introduction of the euro is likely to act as a catalyst for these changes, speeding up the emergence of a genuine single market for financial services. There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty involved, since only time will tell how financial institutions will respond strategically to the opportunities and challenges brought about by the euro, and how customers and investors will change their behaviour. In terms of its timing and effects, the impact of the euro will probably vary significantly across different types of financial services and markets. The segment of the financial system that is being addressed at this Conference - housing finance - is an integral part of retail banking where, at the risk of oversimplification, the impact of the euro is likely to be more gradual than in other areas of financial activity. In this respect, the basic question which I should like to address today is whether the euro can be expected to lead to a significant integration of the national housing finance markets in the EU. So far, these have in fact remained largely segmented to the extent that activities are still conducted predominantly by domestic institutions. In addressing this issue, I intend to proceed as follows: after recalling the main trends in and features of the housing finance markets in the EU, I will attempt to highlight what I believe to be the most likely effects of the euro with respect to lowering the barriers to entry in this specific sector and to offer some conclusions.   Discernible trends in and features of housing finance   Without presuming to identify all relevant trends and features, the EU housing finance market might, in summary, be said to have been characterised by three main developments in the past. First, there has been a general tendency for mortgage lending to increase overall. Over the past ten years, outstanding mortgage loans for residential property have more than doubled in most European countries. In some countries (especially in Spain, Italy and Portugal), the increase has been even more marked. The underlying factors behind these developments are the improvements in living standards which have raised the quality of the required dwellings, the stability of the macro-economic environment and, in particular over the past few years, the decline in interest rates. Mortgage lending continued to expand significantly in many European countries in 1997, namely by about 2.5% in the EU. However, many structural features of the property markets, such as the level of owner occupation, continue to influence the scope of lending. The ratio of mortgage loans to the gross domestic product (GDP) still varies across EU countries, ranging from over 50% in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to below 10% in Greece and Italy. Second, there has been steady growth in the volume of outstanding mortgage bonds used as a form of funding over the last decade. However, the extent to which institutions resort to capital markets varies substantially across countries. Countries with dedicated mortgage credit institutions also tend to have relatively deep mortgage bond markets, as these institutions finance their fixed-rate lending by issuing fixed-rate bonds to match their interest rate exposure. This holds true, in particular, of Denmark and Sweden and, albeit to a lesser degree, of Germany. In other countries, retail savings tend to be the most important means of funding as banks or mutual institutions act as intermediaries for most of the mortgage loans. Third, despite common trends, historically developed contractual and institutional differences still largely prevail across countries, if the current situation is compared with that of, say, a decade ago. In particular, many aspects of housing finance have remained closely linked to national regulations (security and consumer protection issues, for instance), national taxation (tax deductions and stamp duties), and national subsidies as well as to administrative procedures that thwart or even discriminate against cross-border operations. These differences make it difficult or, occasionally, impossible to develop standard \"pan-European\" products or capital market instruments. It should be acknowledged, however, that the European Commission has been active in developing common consumer protection standards in order to enhance the single market. The lack of familiarity with the specific conditions of national markets is likely to be another major reason why the markets for housing finance have remained localised. From the borrower\\'s perspective, caution with respect to foreign institutions may partly be explained by the sheer size of the loan required. From the lender\\'s perspective, the inadequate familiarity with national features of the market gives local institutions a competitive edge. Segmentation in the EU housing finance market has persisted despite the fact that the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive has significantly lowered the legal barriers to cross-border entry by permitting institutions from any one country to operate freely in another. Against this background, one might ask what implications the introduction of the euro might have for the EU housing finance markets.   The euro factor: Speeding up cross-border activities   In my view, there are a number of reasons to believe that the introduction of the euro will foster a further integration of the EU housing finance markets - perhaps not in the short term, but at least in the medium-term - by eliminating certain \"non-legal\" barriers to cross-border operations of credit institutions in this sector. To the extent that this objective is achieved, the euro would help significantly to complement single market legislation. In this respect, I should like to draw attention to three key aspects. First, the introduction of the euro can be expected to trigger an increase in cross-border lending operations mainly because the disappearance of foreign exchange risk will reduce risks and costs for both lenders and borrowers. On the supply side, in particular, institutions will be able to fund their lending in another euro area country from their domestic retail deposit base or euro denominated bond markets without incurring specific foreign exchange-related risks. Moreover, the expected increase in competition as a result of the introduction of the euro may compel institutions to broaden their customer base across national borders in order to spread their fixed banking costs. This will take place in an environment in which technological development will likewise affect cross-border lending activity. Direct banking facilities (such as telephone banking) may, in fact, increasingly allow customers to be extended credit \"from a distance\". The need to establish a branch network - which has always been considered a major barrier for mortgage institutions wishing to enter foreign markets - would consequently lose importance. On the demand side, the interest of customers in mortgage loans offered by foreign institutions should also increase as a direct consequence of the disappearance of foreign exchange risk. Such an increased interest should also stem from the enhanced comparability of prices of banking services throughout the euro area. This enhanced transparency is set, in itself, to increase competition among institutions. Some time will be needed before customers become sufficiently aware of the new state of affairs. In particular, these effects should become more pronounced when customers start to receive income in euro and become accustomed to new market conventions. Second, the introduction of the euro is expected to increase the recourse to mortgage bonds as a form of funding, also on a cross-border basis. In general terms, the euro will make European bond markets more attractive, since the increase in the number of issuers and investors operating in the same currency would increase the liquidity of and reduce the cost of obtaining funding from these markets. The national bias is likely to diminish and funds will increasingly be managed on a wider international basis, possibly involving reallocation of existing investments. Moreover, the euro will be introduced at a time when current and prospective inflation as well as nominal interest rates in the euro area are low. In this context, the possibility of using bonds issued by credit institutions operating in the field of housing finance as collateral in ESCB monetary policy operations can enhance the liquidity of such bond issues and contribute to the development of the respective markets. These bonds may be included in the list of eligible assets if they meet the established criteria. The list of eligible assets is available on the ECB\\'s Internet website. The eligibility criteria are specified in the document entitled \"The Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three - General Documentation on ESCB Monetary Policy Instruments and Procedures\", which is also available on the ECB\\'s Internet website. It should be borne in mind that, so far, low liquidity (high liquidity premia) and prepayment risks (the possibility of a premature amortisation of the underlying mortgage loans leading to a premature repayment of the principal to the final bondholders) seem often to have been the biggest obstacles to the issuance of mortgage-related securities. If the euro-denominated market offers a possibility for larger issues, the liquidity obstacle would be reduced, possibly encouraging larger scale international activity in the mortgage lending business. The prepayment risk could likewise be reduced through a cross-border diversification of lending. Third, the introduction of the euro represents an opportunity to broaden the use of mortgage-backed securities. The issuance of these instruments has been taking place in an increasing number of EU countries, and respective changes to legislation are underway. At the end of 1996, however, mortgage-backed securities only accounted for less than 1% of the total stock of mortgage loans in the EU. This is in sharp contrast to the United States where the securitisation has advanced very far. There are many reasons for this trend in the United States, namely the emergence of large \"secondary institutions\" acting as large-scale security issuers, a shortage of retail deposit funding, banks\\' incentives to reduce maturity mismatches and - perhaps most importantly - the existence of a deep capital market in US dollars. For European countries, the further development of mortgage-backed securities - which is rather limited so far - could expand the use of the capital market funding as well as the range of products offered to customers.   Conclusions   To sum up, I should like to underline three aspects. First, it should be recognised that, while the integration of the EU housing finance market has been modest to date, the introduction of the euro will represent a significant opportunity to achieve further integration. From the perspective of the euro area, attempting to establish a more integrated housing finance market is a desirable objective since it would bring benefits to consumers in terms of both a wider range of products on offer and reduced costs stemming from increased competition among lenders and lending practices. Whether the EU housing finance market will actually become more integrated under the influence of the euro will depend, to a certain extent, on the attitude of the institutions concerned. These institutions are expected, wherever and to the extent possible, to make use of the opportunity offered by the introduction of the euro to expand beyond their own home markets. Further integration will, of course, also depend on the degree to which remaining fiscal and regulatory differences across countries are eliminated. The sooner these differences can be reduced by the competent authorities, the faster will the euro have a perceptible impact. Second, it should be acknowledged that the introduction of the euro will trigger substantial changes in the European capital markets by fostering an increased width and depth of these markets. In general, financial institutions operating in the mortgage sector are expected further to increase their recourse to the capital market since it represents a possibility for more efficient funding. This also demands that those financial institutions which have not resorted to capital market funding so far, are invited to exploit this opportunity. Indeed, the issuance of securities as a form of funding mortgage lending might even become a necessity, if saving shifts increasingly away from bank deposits, as has often been envisaged. This stems from the consideration that, in a more competitive environment, the option to fund cheaply is likely to become a more and more decisive factor. Finally, it should be pointed out that the changes in the financial landscape triggered by the introduction of the euro will bring numerous strategic challenges and risks for credit and financial institutions. The forecast increase in competition is also likely to affect the funding side and to reduce the share of cheap retail deposits. Therefore, all institutions should be aware of and prepared to adapt to changes in market conditions, fiercer competition and increasing demand for low-cost service. This will also apply to institutions operating in the mortgage sector. Against this background, it is important that the adjustment takes place smoothly, without any adverse effects on the stability of the financial system. To that end, all the authorities responsible for ensuring financial stability will play their specific role.   ']\n",
      "['1998-11-03', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Introductory statement with Q&A', 'Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank', '  ECB Press conference: Introductory statement   Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Ladies and gentlemen, as in previous months, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today\\'s meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. The number of items considered by the Governing Council required a full-day meeting. Most of the items on the agenda were of a rather technical nature or were related to the legal implementation of decisions already taken at previous Governing Council meetings. Part of the meeting was attended by Mr. Edlinger, President of the EU Council, and by Commissioners de Silguy and Monti.  Let me first turn to the Governing Council\\'s in-depth discussion on recent economic,  monetary and financial developments.   Starting with the global macroeconomic environment, it was felt that the spiral of bad news has not continued over the most recent weeks. Also, when looking at market developments, we have observed a strengthening of the US dollar vis-a-vis euro area currencies since its trough in mid-October. We have seen a recovery in global stock markets and we have also witnessed some upward correction of long-term bond yields after they had fallen sharply as a result of a \"flight to quality\". However, markets displayed considerable volatility during the month of October, reflecting the uncertainty prevailing in the world economy.  Whether or not we can now expect a process towards more normal conditions remains to be seen. Given the underlying causes of the adverse conditions in Asia , Russia and other parts of the world, a quick resolution is in any case not very likely. Moreover, it is by now quite clear that the world economy will suffer from these developments in 1999 and that the euro area will also be affected to some extent.  However, the crucial and widely debated issue is the degree to which such effects on the euro area will materialise and how long they may last.  As matters stand, there appears to be consensus that euro area economic growth will slow down to some extent in 1999, driven largely by a weakening in net exports. In its latest forecast, published on 21 October 1998 , the Commission has revised downwards aggregate euro area real GDP growth to 2.6% in 1999, compared with the increase of 3.2% projected earlier this year. According to the same source, the slowdown is expected to be only temporary and real GDP growth is anticipated to strengthen again in 2000, with the contribution of net trade improving. At the same time, the outlook for inflation in the near term remains generally favourable, assuming continued wage moderation and subdued developments in import prices.  In today\\'s discussion, the Governing Council agreed to examine further the broad outlook for the euro area at its two meetings in December. In this context, we shall thoroughly discuss the downside risks for output growth resulting from the evolution of world trade and from international financial tensions and the possibility of still more subdued price developments. However, one should also mention the fact that a relaxation of fiscal policies and higher wage increases could lead to a reversal of current developments in consumer prices and undermine confidence. Any uncertainties arising in these two fields would of course considerably complicate our assessment, given the high degree of uncertainty already associated with the developments in the global economy.  With respect to today\\'s review of the monetary, financial and macroeconomic situation in the euro area, the following aspects were discussed.  First, with reference to monetary growth, let me recall that when looking at various definitions of broad money, our preliminary data show broadly similar and stable annual growth rates of between 3 and 5% in 1997 and the first half of 1998. According to our initial analysis these monetary trends do not appear to signal inflationary pressures at this juncture. However, a further assessment will be made in December on the basis of more up-to-date information.  Second, with respect to price developments, euro area HICP inflation fell from 1.2% in August to 1.0% in September 1998. The generally low level of HICP increases mainly reflects a decline in energy prices, which were almost 4% lower in September than a year earlier, and in other commodity prices; in addition, price pressure as indicated by industrial output prices and unit labour costs has remained modest. With respect to the decline in HICP inflation in September, this is closely related to a relatively strong fall in food prices (from 1.8% in August to 1.4% in September 1998), which account for almost one-quarter of the total HICP. Such monthly changes are certainly very difficult to interpret. However, I may point out that food prices display a larger degree of volatility owing to their seasonal pattern.  Third, taking into account distorting factors such as calendar effects, underlying developments in euro area-wide real GDP have remained fairly stable. Economic expansion was broadly unchanged in the first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of 1997. Also, at this juncture, data partly available for the summer months point to the possibility that recent rates of output growth may be broadly sustained beyond the first half of this year. While the trends appear in some cases weaker, particularly when also looking at some national data, the latest euro area-wide survey data on confidence, order books and capacity utilisation generally remain well above their long-run averages. However, further developments in these data will have to be monitored closely. Concerning the assessment of the monetary policy stance in the euro area, the Governing Council - after having carefully reviewed all factors and developments - confirmed the view taken at its previous meeting. It considered further interest rate convergence towards the lower end of the current range prevailing in the euro area as being appropriate. Measured by key central bank rates, the lowest rates in the euro area currently stand at 3.3%. Market interest rates have also reached very low levels. In terms of three-month interest rates, the euro area average rate has fallen to 3.75%, following the reduction of interest rates by a number of euro area central banks. With the announcement today of further interest rate reductions by the Banco de Espana and the Banco de Portugal, both effective tomorrow, the euro area average will continue its downward trend. Nominal and real long-term interest rates for the euro area are at historically low levels. It confirms the high degree of confidence that the euro has gained in the judgement of the general public and of global investors. This confidence is a major asset in the consolidation of a financial environment conducive to growth.  As has been proven in many instances in the past, monetary policy cannot solve structural problems. Indeed, monetary policies in the euro area countries have increasingly converged over the past few years and resulted in low levels of interest rates. Several countries have followed virtually a \"common monetary policy stance\" over a longer period, but performances - for example in labour markets - within the euro area differ considerably from country to country. The degree of success in this area seems to be closely related to structural reforms implemented in earlier years.  I am confident that we can cope both with current problems and with future challenges. This requires a forward-looking, medium-term-oriented monetary policy, which keeps inflationary expectations low. This is the decisive contribution of monetary policy to the fostering of growth and employment. Dealing with structural problems is the task of policies other than monetary policy.  Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of the preparatory work for Stage Three.    (a) Preparations for the \"changeover weekend\"   With less than 60 days to go before the start of Stage Three, we are obviously attaching particular importance to the provision of a framework allowing for a smooth changeover to the euro. We began our preparations a long time ago and I am confident that the ESCB will be in a position to deliver its entire complex infrastructure to the markets by the morning of 4 January 1999 . I expect the banking and financial community in the euro area to be fully aware both of the logistical challenge that the changeover weekend represents and of the need for careful preparation. Given the concentration of migration operations to the euro to be conducted by a multitude of financial agents (i.e. payment systems, securities settlement systems, custodians, individual banks, exchanges and financial information providers) in the period from 31 December 1998 to 4 January 1999, the ESCB is preparing to work together with other public authorities to orchestrate the necessary policy responses to any unexpected events. To this end, the Governing Council has set up an ad hoc \"Changeover Weekend Committee\" which will organise the monitoring of developments vis-a-vis the final migration to the euro within the ECB and the national central banks and in the banking and financial industry, both prior to and during the changeover weekend.  Additional details on the preparation of the changeover weekend are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening.   (b)  Payment systems issues   With regard to euro payment and settlement systems, I should like to draw your attention to recent developments which suggest that many market participants consider the euro as a special currency to which the traditional rules applied elsewhere in the developed world would not necessarily be applicable. Initiatives were taken, or allowed to develop, that have no precedent in the arrangements concerning other currencies. This relates in particular to the granting of payment finality and intraday credit in a currency other than a country\\'s own. Therefore, the Governing Council considered it appropriate to issue a policy statement clearly spelling out the fact that the rules which apply to all of the other currencies in the world will also apply to the euro, and that the ECB bears the same responsibilities as all the other central banks in the world.  This policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euro area is to be issued to you this evening.  The Governing Council also agreed on the main features of the legal framework within which the TARGET system will operate. These main features are set out in greater detail in the \"Third progress report on the TARGET project\", which the Governing Council endorsed today. In common with previous progress reports, the current one will be published in the near future and will provide further technical details of interest to market participants.   (c)  Exchange of national banknotes   In the absence of euro banknotes at the start of Stage Three, the Governing Council today agreed on arrangements according to which the participating national central banks will exchange legal tender banknotes of other participating Member States for national banknotes and coins at the official conversion rate as from 1 January 1999 . To ensure substitutability between the national currency units, the Governing Council decided that each participating national central bank will arrange for such an exchange at one location at least. The national central banks may, however, limit the number and/or the total volume of banknotes they are prepared to accept for any given transaction or on any one day.  Further details on that matter are provided in a separate press release which is to be issued to you this evening.   (d)  Allocation of monetary income   As regards the income arising from the issuance of national banknotes from the participating Member States the Governing Council today decided that such income will not be redistributed prior to the introduction of the euro banknotes. The Governing Council also confirmed with respect to the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of the participating Member States for the financial years 1999 to 2001, that the monetary income for the said period will be calculated by employing the so-called indirect method, by multiplying a defined liability base by a specified reference rate of interest. The sum of the monetary income of each national central bank will be allocated to the participating national central banks in proportion to their paid-up share in the ECB\\'s capital. Owing to the temporary character of the current decision, the question of monetary income allocation will need to be revisited before the introduction of euro banknotes in 2002.   (e)  Transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB   Today the Governing Council also adopted an ECB Guideline establishing the legal format as well as the modalities of the initial transfer of foreign reserves from the national central banks to the ECB. In this connection and as a measure for covering possible foreign exchange risks for the ECB, the Governing Council endorsed, in line with the Statute of the ESCB, an ECB Recommendation for a Council Regulation which would authorise the ECB to increase its capital from the current level of €5 billion to up to twice that amount.   (f)  Monetary and foreign exchange policy   Further decisions have also been taken with regard to preparing the monetary and foreign exchange policy of the euro area. On previous occasions I have mentioned to you that legal acts are under preparation which specify general principles to be followed by the national central banks when carrying out operations in domestic assets and liabilities and in foreign exchange reserve assets remaining with the national central banks. Such instruments, which are based on provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, aim from a legal point of view at ensuring the singleness of the ECB\\'s monetary policy and the consistency of such transactions with the Community\\'s exchange rate and monetary policies. Against this background, the Governing Council today adopted an ECB Guideline which establishes certain reporting obligations for the national central banks\\' domestic asset and liability management operations and subjects such transactions to the prior approval of the ECB whenever they exceed a certain amount. A similar ECB Guideline was adopted which subjects all operations in foreign reserve assets - including gold - which exceed a certain amount to the approval of the ECB. In addition, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Guideline according to which any participating Member States\\' transactions with their foreign exchange working balances which exceed a certain amount have to be notified to the ECB in advance. A similar arrangement is envisaged between the ECB and the Commission of the European Communities for all foreign exchange transactions carried out in the context of implementing the Commission\\'s budget.  In the context of the statutory function of the ESCB to contribute to the smooth conduct of policies of competent authorities in the field of banking supervision and financial stability, the Governing Council discussed the main driving forces that are likely to affect the EU banking systems in the medium and long term, including the establishment of EMU. The Council members hold the view that the establishment of EMU is expected to reinforce the structural tendencies that are already under way in the EU banking systems. These tendencies include the reduction of excess capacity, pressure on profitability, enhanced competition, increased internationalisation and geographical diversification. One important aspect is the fact that EU banks seem to have significantly increased their awareness of the strategic implications of the introduction of the euro over the past few months. They are devising specific responses accordingly, which include: (i) improvements in services and procedures; (ii) changes in the range of products supplied to customers; and (iii) mergers, strategic alliances and co-operation agreements. We intend to make the outcome of this examination public in due course.  Finally, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Decision concerning public access to the  documentation and archives of the ECB. This Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  We are now at your disposal should you have any questions.       Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, and Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the ECB    Question (translation): President Duisenberg, you said that labour market and economic problems which are structural in character cannot be solved by monetary policy. Is this an appeal to certain leading policy makers - one of whom bears a French name, even though he is German - to stop pressuring you? Second Question: Is it really possible, in times of historically low interest rates, to promote consumption and investment through lower interest rates?  Duisenberg: I didn\\'t understand the second question. Question (translation): The second Question: is it really possible to promote or encourage consumption and investment through central interest rates which are lower than those currently prevailing in Germany, for instance?  Duisenberg: The answer to the first question is that it is an appeal to all politically responsible office holders, and not to a single one. Because of the fact that monetary policy cannot solve structural problems, it is an appeal to those politically responsible to bear their responsibility in the right direction, but not any single one. Whether it is possible to promote consumption and investment through lower interest rates is very doubtful. The main factor contributing to the promotion of consumption and investment is confidence, and continued confidence, as well as continuity and stability also in monetary policy, whereas one quarter more or less is not the driving force behind consumer or investment spending.  Question: The German Finance Minister has proposed closer policy co-ordination between monetary and fiscal policy. Could you tell us how far such policy can go under the euro zone, and specifically where the limits of this Cupertino would be? And I have a second question about the proposals by the Italian commissioner Mario Monti who has written a letter to the President of the European Commission urging for the Stability and Growth Pact to be re-interpreted on the lines of the \"Golden Rule\" of fiscal policy.  Duisenberg: The co-ordination of policies in the economic field in general, i.e. monetary policies, fiscal policies, wage policies, is foreseen in the Treaty to take place through a dialogue between the various authorities on an almost continuous basis. That means, the President of the ECOFIN has the right to attend the meetings of the Council of the European Central Bank. He even has the right to introduce motions there, but he does not have the right to vote on those motions. And, conversely, the President and/or members of the Executive Board have the right to be invited to meetings of the ECOFIN Council. There is a continuous dialogue going on on the general stance of the various policies. Only the decisions on the various aspects of policies, be it monetary, be it fiscal, be it wage policies, are being upheld by the separate authorities in their independent way. I have not seen the precise proposals that Mr. Monti has formulated, but - to the extent that they were to undermine the Stability and Growth Pact to be applied to the full, as was intended - to that extent, I can assure you that the Council is not too happy with those proposals. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, have you already discussed whether your monetary policy strategy will include only one single reference rate or whether there will be an additional corridor and when can such a decision be expected?  Duisenberg: We have not discussed that particular question anew. We have - as was indicated in our previous press conference - defined what price stability is, what we understand price stability to be, and I would like to repeat that we define price stability as a rate of increase - and I underline the word increase - in prices of below 2%.  Question: Mr. President, you said that the President of the Council, Mr. Edlinger, and two commissioners Monti and de Silguy joined you in the meeting today. What were the topics that were discussed and did you join in the present discussion about publicity of the ECB and about level of interest rates, and which conclusions can be drawn from the discussions with these politicians.  Duisenberg: Now, with Mr. Edlinger we had, in particular, an exchange of views on the current stance of economic policies in general, including monetary policy, and the assessment as we and the Finance Ministers respectively saw economic development in the world and in the euro area, in particular. Mr. de Silguy was present at the entire meeting of the Council, except when Mr. Monti was present, when we discussed areas of banking supervision which were outlined by the Vice-President a moment ago and which, in the European Commission, fall into his area of competence.  Question: Could I ask you what damage if any do you think will be done to the credibility of the new European single currency if you and politicians don\\'t seem to be speaking with the same voice on interest rates, if this current difference appears to continue?  Duisenberg: I haven\\'t seen yet that we don\\'t speak with the same voice, because the central bankers have not spoken yet. And I hear different through the media; I hear various wishes being expressed, which I regard as normal. And they will not damage the credibility of the euro in any way, because they will not, in any way, have an impact on the behaviour of the decision-making body of the ECB, i.e. the Governing Council. Question (translation): Mr. President, a question on economic policy and on monetary policy in 1999. Fiscal and wage policy makers in many countries hold the view that they should take an expansionary stance so as to make up for gaps in demand. What is your position in this respect and how will monetary policy makers respond? What is your assessment, against this background, of the policy mix between monetary, fiscal and wage policy in view of the statements made by economic policy makers in the EMU countries?  Duisenberg: Well, we have noted already on various occasions both here and in the European Parliament -we and the European Commission have done the same - that we are somewhat concerned about the intensity with which the policies are directed to meet the criteria - not only the Maastricht criteria - but also the criteria implied in the Stability and Growth Pact. And we have warned against that repeatedly and have, in fact, done so again today. Nevertheless, I must conclude that, given the current monetary policy stance and assuming that that monetary policy stance will be continued also during the transition to the euro and given the current fiscal policy stance, there seem to be no indications that there is a policy mix in euroland which is detrimental to either fiscal or monetary policies.  Question: I have got a rather technically question on the press release about the exchanging of national banknotes. There is this point about the National Central Banks being allowed to limit the number or the total value of banknotes they are prepared to accept for any given transaction and on a given day. Now, what is the logic behind this? Because I just thought that, if this is implemented, there is the danger - is there not - of damaged credibility if people refuse to accept one another\\'s banknotes under the new system. It sort of evokes those old pictures of a run on the bank and the guichet being closed. And also ...  Duisenberg: That would happen if you were to set that limit very low, but that is not the intention.  Question: And then another small Question: In this ad hoc Changeover Weekend Committee, who is going to be on that, the ad hoc committee for your changeover weekend?  Duisenberg: The committee has already been established. It will be a decentral committee and also a decentral early warning point for any developments in the event of matters getting out of line with the plans. So, who will be on the committee? There will be three people from each participating national central bank and from the ECB, and the committee will be chaired by the Director General Operations of the European Central Bank, Mr. Papadia.  Question: It seems that euro is now gaining the confidence and is being appreciated against other currencies like US$, and some concerns about the dampening effect of euro\\'s appreciation on the European economy, and some people like the new German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, are proposing to establish the target zone for the exchange rate between euro and US$. So what is your idea about this?  Duisenberg: As I have indicated in my Introductory Statement, after a period of depreciation of the dollar vis-à-vis the euro, or of appreciation of the euro, that trend has been reversed in recent days to some extent and as I indicated already a month ago, the level that has been reached and that has, in the meantime, somewhat changed again does not imply a cause of concern for the monetary authorities in Europe. Your second question on target zones: I want to repeat that the competence on exchange rate policies is in the hands of governments and not of the monetary authorities, but I do not want to keep secret either that, at this stage, when we are introducing the euro and getting the euro settled and into a credible currency, we are not very enthusiastic of taking up the idea of target zones at this stage. Question (translation): Mr. President, I should like to revert once more to the domestic policy debate in Germany. As you know, some of those involved are of the opinion that the heated controversy about the role and tasks as well as the independence of the Deutsche Bundesbank is, in essence, actually aimed at the European Central Bank as the Bundesbank will be giving up its responsibility in two months\\' time. Do you share this view and, if so, are you - as has been said - feeling placed under pressure or influenced by this debate?  Duisenberg: The answer can be fairly simple. The answer to the first question is \"yes\", And the answer to the second question is \"no\". Question (translation): Mr. President, I have probably not understood this issue properly, payment issues: the point you want to make there. Is it correct if I interpret it as such that you want to clearly say that you are prepared to be lender of last resort in cases of banking troubles.  Duisenberg: On the issue of lender of last resort, I will say no more than I said at the last press conference, which was already very little. And I would like to ask Monsieur Noyer to explain precisely what we do want to say. Noyer: What the Governing Council has discussed is, how can we in the Governing Council take into account the general responsibility of the ECB to contribute to a smooth conduct of policies by national authorities, because the precise tasks are, in the end, for national authorities to check whether the transition to the euro creates its special problems or is likely to accelerate some tendencies, and how can we assess any new risks that may arise and the best way to respond. It has nothing to do with the idea of lender of last resort that was addressed precisely by the President the last time in answer to a question on this matter. Question (translation): I should like to return once more to the debate on monetary policy. Could this renewed debate - which, if I have understood you correctly, you feel also has implications for the European Central Bank - could this debate be reason for you personally to re-consider the question of your perhaps retiring early from the office of President, as you had initially indicated?  Duisenberg: I don\\'t think I have to comment any further after what I have said already on what I think of the discussion. So far it is a discussion in one country only. The development of a dialogue between the governmental authorities and the European Central Bank has taken the form of regular meetings of the so-called Euro 11 group, which is a very useful and fitting setting for having a dialogue about policies in general. We do not shy away from such a dialogue. As far as the discussion in one particular country about the position of the central bank, be it the central bank of that country or the European Central Bank, is concerned, I think that, so far, it has been a very one-sided discussion, as I understand it, because no central bank in any country has participated in that discussion, and I assume that this will remain so in the foreseeable future.  Question: (unintelligible)  Duisenberg: Oh, that is a very hypothetical question - if the Treaty of Maastricht were to be changed, which would be required as a result of this discussion and which, in itself, is a very unlikely event, then I would of course also reconsider my position, but I do not regard a change in the Treaty of Maastricht as very likely for the first eight years to come.  Question: I have two questions. The first one concerns convergence. The rates are coming down but some analysts here are saying they are not coming down enough. Do you think that can be dangerous for the euro changeover with the present economic situation slowing down? And the second Question: Some articles appeared in the last weeks with strong criticisms about the central bank being too decentralised, not strong enough. How do you think you want to react to that? Do you think you are strong enough as far as budget, personnel and supervision are concerned? Do you think that you are too decentralised? Are these criticisms completely without the ground?  Duisenberg: On the first question, I do not share the judgement of the analysts you quote that convergence is not enough, because I think we have seen in October, up and to including today, a remarkable rate of convergence toward the lower level of interest rates. And I would like to point out, I mentioned the key central bank interest rates at the moment at the lower end being 3.3%. Today, the Banco de España lowered its rate to 3.5%, so that it is getting close. And the Banco de Portugal has done a similar thing. And, in the case of Portugal, you have to look at the lowest official rate, rather than at the repo rate, because the banking system in Portugal happens to be in a very liquid situation; there is no liquidity deficit in Portugal, but a liquidity surplus. And, therefore, you have to look at the lower rate which is the relevant one to judge by. So convergence has continued and will continue during the remaining 60 days of this year, and we are very close already. Now is the ECB strong enough? I think the ECB is a very strong institution, staffed with highly qualified staff, and we are in the process of expanding it at a rather rapid pace. We are now in the process of finalising our budget for 1999, which also implies a sizeable further increase in the staff of the ECB. Those things take time in practice. Question (translation): I should like to revert once more to the debate on interest rates. As you know, it has been argued time and again that the European Central Bank - or that the level of central rates in Europe cannot, on grounds related to convergence, fall below the mark of 3.3% recorded in the core countries. Do you believe it to be possible for concerted action to reduce interest rates in future EMU countries to be taken before the end of the year or can this only occur next year, when the ECB can determine its interest rates independently? And then I have another question on ...  Duisenberg: Let me first answer the first question. It is, of course, nonsense that interest rates could not be raised or lowered further than below the levels they have already reached. It could be done. Whether it will be done - don\\'t ask me, I would like to say, because, if I were to give you an answer, you wouldn\\'t necessarily have to trust me. I will not, in other words, make forecasts about what will happen to interest rates. But, for the moment, the Council gives the highest priority to the continuation of the convergence process, which you can also interpret as an act of solidarity amongst the 11 central banks involved. Question (translation): And then I have another question on the currently ongoing debate in Germany on the role of the central banks. To what extent do you believe it to be appropriate for that debate to take place in public as it is and how will the ECB participate in it and to what extent do you feel it to be justified for the ECB to gear its interest rate policy also to the employment objective?  Duisenberg: The ECB will not participate in that discussion and, second, I would like to point out that it is the explicit mandate of the ECB with its policies to achieve price stability and - to the extend that the policy would not jeopardise price stability - to contribute to achieving the general economic goals of the Community, as they are spelled out in Article 2 of the Treaty, namely promoting growth and employment. Question (translation): President Duisenberg, you have emphasised that the latest statements of German policy makers in this debate are not pressuring you, but it is another question whether you see these statements as attempts to influence you, as is prohibited under Article 107 of the Maastricht Treaty.  Duisenberg: I do not see them as such. I hold it to be quite normal that, from the political side, there may from time to time be offered opinions or suggestions of what the political authorities would like interest rates to do or to be. That, in itself, is a quite normal phenomenon and it would be very abnormal if those suggestions were to be listened to. But then, as I said earlier, it is actually the right of the political authorities, in the person of the President of the Council of the Ministers of Finance and Economics, not only to attend meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, but also to introduce motions. So he can give suggestions there. The only thing he cannot do is vote on those motions. Question (translation): Mr. President, did Portugal and other European countries co-ordinate the latest reduction of their central or repo rates with you or not? And secondly: which countries are likely also to reduce their interest rates in the next few years, surely those with interest rates deviating most from 3.3 or 3%? Which countries, in your opinion, should make a move? Duisenberg (translation): Co-ordination is an ongoing process; it takes place all the time, and we inform one another continuously. This also holds true of Spain and Portugal, and it is not coincidental that the decisions announced today were announced today. And with regard to your question as to which countries can be expected to follow, I would say it is obvious - those countries in which the level of interest rates is not yet the lowest in Europe.  Question: Mr. President, I have a couple of questions, and one is a short kind of yes/no Question: You mentioned that the dollar has been stronger the last week. Are you pleased with the recent movement direction of the dollar against the German mark?  Duisenberg: Well, as I have said, I was not concerned about the level that the dollar has reached, so I will not express any pleasure at the movement over the last few days. What I am most pleased about is that the situation seems to have settled somewhat.  Question: So you are comfortable with the level of the dollar right now?  Duisenberg: Yes.  Question: The other question has to do with how monetary policy is being decided in Europe right now. There seems to be some confusion. A lot of people are saying the Bundesbank needs to cut rates while at the same time others are saying that the Bundesbank would not make a move without the approval of the ECB Governing Council. It would be interesting to know how this would work out. If the Bundesbank were to cut rates could they do that unilaterally or would they first want to get a green light from you? Second part of that question is, if the ECB Governing Council would vote for a rate cut and ask the Bundesbank to cut, would you expect the Bundesbank to abide by the Governing Council?  Duisenberg: On the first question, I only can give what may seem a legalistic answer. The legal situation is that, until the 1st of January, every single central bank is autonomous in determining its policies. So the answer to your question whether the Bundesbank or De Nederlandsche Bank or the Banque de France could do something unilaterally is \"yes\". If the question were to be \"will they\", the answer would be that it is very unlikely that they will do anything without consulting all their partners. The co-ordination of monetary policy is already taking shape increasingly intensively across Europe.  Question: I was also wondering whether you could expand a bit more on the interest rate cut by Spain and Portugal today. Was that agreed or at least discussed within the ESCB framework beforehand and can we regard that as an interest rate cut by the whole of Euroland? Does that amount to an interest rate cut for the whole euro area since two countries did that today?  Duisenberg: Well, I would like to point out that decisions are not only being taken precisely on the day and hour that the Council is meeting, but we are in continuous touch with each other and there is a continuous co-ordination and discussion going on between central bankers across Europe, so that the developments of today, I can assure you, certainly did not come as a surprise to any of us.

As you are aware the President of the ECB intends to appear regularly before the European Parliament in its plenary sessions or at the level of the Sub-Committee for Monetary Affairs. This is meant to be an important part of the communication policy of the ECB. Against this background, it seems also appropriate for Executive Board members to take part in the proceedings of European Parliament Committees when they deal, as it is the case today with the Development and Co-operation Committee, with matters that are relevant for the ECB. The introduction of the euro is the most momentous event in the international monetary system since the end (or perhaps since the creation) of the Bretton Woods system. The EU as a whole has developed trade and financial relations with 71 countries (the ACP -African, Caribbean and Pacific- countries) through the so-called Lomé Convention. Since the fourth Lomé Convention will expire in February 2000, the European Union and ACP countries started on 30 September 1998 negotiations regarding future arrangements. In addition, France has maintained a long-standing economic and monetary co-operation with 14 African countries and the Comoros (the CFA franc zone), which are members of the ACP group. Together with its African counterparts, France has expressed its intention to maintain the broad features of the existing arrangements with the CFA franc zone, by substituting the euro for the French franc from 1 January 1999. The international implications of the euro for non-EU countries having close links with the Community have recently attracted a great deal of attention. In addition to the Central and Eastern European countries and the Mediterranean countries, the potential impact on the African countries, which account for most of the ACP members (48 out of 71), has also been assessed. As regards specifically the CFA franc zone, it is also of interest to note that a Council Decision on a pegging of the CFA franc and the Comorian franc to the euro is currently under preparation. The ECB has been involved in this preparation and delivered an opinion in the context of a consultation procedure. In my remarks, I will focus, first, on the potential economic impact of the euro on ACP countries and particularly on the CFA franc zone. I will, then, turn to the preparation of a Council Decision concerning the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.    1. Economic impact of the euro on ACP and CFA franc zone countries   As a general remark, I will first note that the ACP countries, and particularly the African countries, are less affected by the current slowdown of the world economy. This is partly because the bulk of their trade is with the EU (especially France) and also because their exports have been less affected by the overall decline in commodity prices. Specifically, the CFA franc zone is forecast to grow at least 4.5% this year, while maintaining very low (by African standards) inflation rates: less than 5% in most of the 15 countries. The introduction of the euro will benefit the world economy if it contributes to higher growth in the euroland and to the maintenance of low inflation and interest rates. This, however, will also depend on efforts being made to reduce European unemployment through structural reforms. Also, the development of integrated, liquid and efficient markets in euro will facilitate access to international bond financing by non-euro governments and private entities. Economic developments in the euro area will affect ACP countries, and particularly the CFA franc zone, through three main channels: - first, an impact on growth, through existing trade linkages; - second, price and exchange rate stability through the use of the euro as a nominal anchor; - and, third, an improved access to international capital markets. As far as downside risks are concerned, the future exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar seems to be the main source of concern.   Impact on growth through trade linkages   A potential strengthening of economic growth in the euro area is bound to benefit its trading partners, like the ACP, through increased exports. In 1996, trade with the EU accounted for 51% of total external trade of the CFA franc zone countries and for 42% for the other 33 African ACP countries. By contrast, the share of the non-African ACP countries was much lower (around 10%). According to IMF estimates, a 1% increase in euro area GDP induces an increase of the CFA franc countries' exports and GDP of 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively. The other African ACP countries are also likely to benefit from similar positive trade linkages. However, the potential impact on non-African ACP countries is bound to be more subdued in view of their limited trade link.   Price and exchange rate stability through the euro peg   For CFA franc zone countries, shifting the peg form the French franc to the euro will contribute to stabilizing the nominal effective exchange rate of the area. This is due to the fact that the EU accounts for 51% of the external trade of the CFA franc zone, while the share of France is only 25%. In addition, the maintainance of price stability in the euro area will also enable the CFA franc zone to keep comparatively low inflation, with a positive impact on the real exchange rate and on external competitiveness. The benefits of nominal and real exchange rate stability will be the greater, the higher the stability of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar. Moreover, in the longer run, the CFA franc zone countries, which mostly export primary commodities priced in US dollars, would benefit from a greater use of the euro for quoting prices on commodity markets.   Improved access to international capital markets   These positive growth and price effects will be supported by improved access of CFA franc zone countries to the European financial markets. Capital movements between the CFA franc zone and the entire euro area, and not only France, are expected to be liberalized after the pegging of the CFA franc to the euro. This, together with the ongoing trade liberalization within the CFA franc zone, should help the zone to reap the benefits from globalisation. However, this will take time and will also depend on the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and the strengthening of domestic financial systems. In the short run, given that in 10 out of the 15 CFA franc zone countries the US dollar and the Japanese yen account for the largest share of their long-term external debt, these countries might have an interest in increasing the share of the euro. This would be advisable in view of the exchange rate risk associated with the US dollar and yen denomination.   The euro's exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar as main risk factor   The main risk of pegging to the euro would be the loss of external competitiveness that could arise form an appreciation of the euro against the US dollar. Price stability will be the primary objective of the ECB and, thus, an active management of the euro against other major currencies is not desirable. This does not mean that the ECB will not take account of the external value of the euro. Exchange rates will continue to be monitored informally by the three main economic and currency blocs, although in the context of new institutional arrangements to be devised. The introduction of the euro may in fact strengthen policy co-ordination between the US, Japan and Europe and contribute to exchange rate stability worldwide, as domestic economic policies in the three regions aim at internal stability. Of course, in the shorter-term, there may still be fluctuations in exchange rates, owing to differences in cyclical positions and associated policy responses. But, in the medium term, confidence in the ability and willingness of the ECB to achieve monetary stability and the overall strength of the Euroland will be the basis for a stable currency. This will benefit the CFA franc zone countries too. Let me now turn to the preparation of a Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.   2. Preparation of a EU Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc   France's relations with the CFA franc countries and the Comoros are not dealt with specifically in the Maastricht Treaty unlike, for instance, the relations of France with its overseas territories. However, the Treaty provides for the possibility of monetary and foreign exchange arrangements with third countries, pursuant to Article 109 (3). In the first half of 1998, the members of the Monetary Committee discussed this matter. On the basis of these discussions and in accordance with Article 109 (3), the Commission presented on 1 July 1998 a recommendation for a EU Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc. This recommendation allows France to maintain the basic features of the present agreement with the CFA franc zone, for two main economic reasons. First, the present guarantee of convertibility of the CFA franc against the French franc is based on a budgetary commitment from the French treasury without any involvement of the Banque de France. In Stage Three, the French treasury will guarantee an unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euro, without any monetary policy implication for the Banque de France or the ESCB. Second, the possible impact on monetary conditions in the euro area of the guarantee of convertibility of the CFA franc vis-à-vis the euro would be extremely limited, given the relative sizes of the euro area and the CFA franc zone. Having consulted the ECB on a first draft, the ECOFIN Council will consider a new text in one of its forthcoming meetings in November or in December of this year. In its opinion expressed on 22 September 1998, which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the ECB considered in particular that:     by authorising France to establish a fixed link between the CFA franc and the euro, neither the Community, nor the ECB will become party to this agreement. This implies that the primary objective of the Community's monetary policy, which is to maintain price stability, will not be compromised;   no obligation of the ESCB may be implied from neither the principle of convertibility of the CFA franc, nor from any modifications to the agreement;   the agreement does not set a precedent with respect to any arrangements that may be decided in the future;   the ECB should, along with the Commission and the future Economic and Financial Committee, be involved in the decisions taken by the parties to the agreement through prior notification or consultation. I cannot elaborate at this stage on the points requiring prior notification or consultation, since I do not wish to prejudge a EU Council decision that is not yet final.       Conclusion   On a more general note, let me state, by way of conclusion, that the ECB regards co-operation with non-European countries as a relevant part of its international responsibilities. We are therefore closely monitoring the negotiation and conclusion of exchange rate arrangements with third countries. We are convinced that the favourable economic fundamentals prevailing in the euro area make the introduction of the euro a stabilising factor for the world economy. The pursuit by the ECB of a policy ensuring price stability is the best contribution we can make to international co-operation in general and in our relations with the ACP countries in particular.  \"]\n",

The implications of the euro for the economic policy framework in Europe   On entering the European Monetary Union, the eleven participating countries will permanently give up their own national monetary policy. Monetary policy decisions will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and will be based on euro area wide considerations. The primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability in the euro area. Price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. In order to achieve this objective, the ESCB will pursue a strategy comprising two elements: 1) money will be assigned a prominent role through the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate; and 2) there will be a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments on the basis of a wide range of indicators. The focus on euro area wide developments implies that if an asymmetric shock were to hit a specific Member State, or if business cycles were not to be synchronised across the euro area, the necessary adjustment at the national level would have to be performed by fiscal and structural measures. In practice, this situation was apparent already in the process towards Monetary Union. The convergence process towards Monetary Union meant that a degree of nominal convergence never before experienced in Europe was achieved. The credibility established through the convergence process became evident during the recent turmoil in the international financial markets. Exchange rates remained stable within the exchange rate mechanism ERM and long-term interest rates spreads widened only slightly. While recognising the achievements made in embarking on a path towards stability-oriented policies and a high degree of nominal convergence, we also have to admit that unemployment is still unacceptably high in the euro area. However, I would like to stress that monetary policy is neither the cause of nor the solution to the unemployment problem in Europe. The problems with European labour markets are structural. Unemployment in Europe can thus only be effectively combated through reforms addressing these underlying structural problems. On the whole, the economic fundamentals of the euro area economies look better now than they have done for many decades. Inflation is low, savings are high, public finances have improved and domestic demand seems to continue being strong. Even if it is clear that external effects will hamper the growth prospects also in the euro countries, it appears that the euro area is presently experiencing more stable and favourable economic conditions than most other regions in the world.    2. The role of the euro in the international financial system   The introduction of the euro will be the biggest change in the international financial system since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. It is likely that the euro will play a very important role in the international financial markets, benefiting from the reputation inherited from the currencies which it will replace. Several arguments seem to indicate that the euro may become a more attractive investment currency than all the currencies which it will replace taken together.      First, the integration of European markets will lead to lower transaction costs and higher market liquidity, thus possibly inducing a virtuous circle of increasing issuance and investment in euro denominated assets by international investors.    Second, the integrated euro area financial markets will offer a more diversified set of financial instruments than that which is currently available in any national market of the euro area today. This will give international investors a greater scope for portfolio diversification without their having to incur additional foreign exchange risk.    Third, to the extent that the euro area is a large and rather closed economy, yields on bonds denominated in euro are likely to become increasingly independent from changes in US yields as compared with the present situation for bonds denominated in the national currencies. If so, euro area bonds will provide an attractive opportunity for investors who would like to achieve increased risk diversification in relation to US financial instruments.   Fourth, the euro may also become an attractive currency for the investment of official reserves. It may become an important anchor currency in other European countries which, formally or informally, might find it useful to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a basket of currencies in which the euro is a large component. Apart from the non-euro EU currencies to be included in the new exchange rate mechanism ERM II, this may also be an attractive solution for transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe and non-EU Mediterranean countries.      A further aspect of the internationalisation of the euro will be its developing role as a transaction and vehicle currency for cross-border transactions outside the euro area. Today, the US dollar is by far the most important international transaction currency. The euro may become an important currency for invoicing of foreign trade and for spot foreign exchange operations. On the whole, there is little doubt that the euro will have a more important role in the international financial system than any of its constituent currencies. Confidence in the future internal and external stability of the euro will be a key factor in determining the international importance of the euro. Another factor will be the efficiency and international competitiveness of the European financial markets.    3. The role of the euro for the development of the European financial markets   The European financial markets are currently undergoing a rapid development characterised by cross-border integration and provision of new financial services. I should like to highlight a few areas where the introduction of the euro is likely to directly influence the working of the financial markets in the euro area:      First, the conduct of a single monetary policy is expected to lead to a fully integrated money market in the euro area as from the start of Stage Three. The integration of the existing national money markets will be made possible thanks to the TARGET system, which will connect the national real-time gross settlement systems in the euro area. It will thereby facilitate banks\\' cross-border dealing and accessing of funds in euro.    Second, the ESCB has developed a market oriented monetary policy framework, largely relying on regular reverse transactions offered through tender procedures. This is likely to provide an incentive for the establishment of a euro area-wide interbank repo market and, possibly, at a later stage, a private repo market.    Third, the ESCB will also make use of a minimum reserve system so as to pursue the aims of stabilising money market rates and enlarging the structural deficit of the banking sector. Particular emphasis was placed on the establishment of a minimum reserve system which is compatible with market principles. For example, the reserve holdings will be remunerated at the rate of the ESCB\\'s main refinancing operations.    Fourth, the ESCB will accept a wide range of public and private assets as collateral for its credit operations. It will also provide the counterparties\\' with the possibility to use collateral cross-border within the euro area. This approach is likely to provide a stimulus to the development of markets for private assets, portfolio diversification across the euro area and the integration of capital markets.    Fifth, the integration of the financial markets will benefit from the ESCB\\'s work to harmonise market practices in the euro area-wide money market. The move to Monetary Union may in due time also contribute to a harmonisation of practices in bond and equity markets in the EU. This harmonisation will improve the effectiveness of price formation and contribute to more efficient financial markets across the board.      On a more general level, cross-border integration may promote the markets for commercial paper and corporate bonds in the euro area. The market value of corporate bonds outstanding in the US is at present almost ten times larger than in the euro area. There is thus plenty of scope for further securitisation in the euro area and the introduction of the euro certainly underpins this development. These developments will have important structural implications for the banking industry in the euro area in addition to the effects of increased cross-border competition. So far, the European banking industry has remained segmented into rather small national markets; the introduction of the euro is expected to give momentum to cross-border integration in the European banking sector resulting from the disappearance of the natural \"protective barriers\" implied by national currencies. To conclude: The developments of the European financial sector are likely to greatly improve the efficiency in the mobilisation of savings and in the channelling of these savings into productive investments - and thus improve the growth potential of the euro area as a whole.

Duisenberg, Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank, beim Prognos-Zukunftsforum 1998, am 23. Oktober 1998 in Basel', '  Die Bedeutung des Euro für die Wirtschafts- und Finanzpolitik in Europa   Vortrag von Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank, beim Prognos-Zukunftsforum 1998, am 23. Oktober 1998 in Basel      Einleitung    In gut zwei Monaten werden elf europäische Staaten gemeinsam ein historisches Vorhaben in die Tat umsetzen. Sie werden ihre nationalen Währungen durch eine einheitliche Währung ersetzen - den Euro. Ab dem 1. Januar 1999 werden die Wechselkurse zwischen den Währungen der elf Teilnehmerstaaten unwiderruflich festgelegt. Gleichzeitig geht die Verantwortung für die Geldpolitik im Euro-Währungsgebiet auf das Europäische System der Zentralbanken (ESZB) über, das sich aus der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) und den nationalen Zentralbanken der EU-Mitgliedstaaten zusammensetzt. Vollendet wird der Übergang zum Euro zu Beginn des Jahres 2002, wenn die nationalen Banknoten und Münzen durch Euro-Banknoten und -Münzen ersetzt werden. Die Einführung des Euro ist ein gewaltiges logistisches Unterfangen. Die Einführung einer einheitlichen Währung wird zweifellos weitreichende ökonomische Konsequenzen haben, und zwar nicht nur in den Teilnehmerstaaten, sondern auch für das globale Währungssystem. Darüber hinaus stellt sie auch einen wichtigen symbolischen Schritt auf dem langen Weg zur europäischen Integration dar. In meinem heutigen Vortrag möchte ich mich auf die Bedeutung der Einführung des Euro aus drei unterschiedlichen Perspektiven konzentrieren. Zunächst einmal werde ich mich mit der Frage befassen, wie die Einführung des Euro das wirtschaftspolitische Szenarium in den Teilnehmerstaaten beeinflussen wird. Danach werde ich kurz auf die voraussichtlichen Auswirkungen des Euro auf das Unternehmensumfeld in Europa eingehen. Abschließend werde ich einen kurzen Überblick über die Rolle des Euro im Hinblick auf die Entwicklung der Finanzmärkte in Europa geben.      Der Euro - Die Auswirkungen auf die Wirtschaftspolitik in Europa    Mit dem Beitritt zur Währungsunion wird jeder der elf Teilnehmerstaaten jegliche Möglichkeit zur Gestaltung einer eigenen nationalen Geldpolitik auf Dauer aufgeben. Die Satzung des ESZB bestimmt, daß das vorrangige Ziel der einheitlichen europäischen Geldpolitik darin besteht, die Preisstabilität innerhalb des gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiets zu gewährleisten. Dies bedeutet, daß die Geldpolitik des ESZB in Fällen, in denen ein Mitgliedstaat ein Ereignis zu bewältigen hat, das keine oder nur begrenzte Auswirkungen auf das übrige Euro-Währungsgebiet hat (einem sogenannten \\x93asymmetrischen Schock\\x94), keinerlei Spielraum hätte, darauf in differenzierter, länderspezifischer Weise zu reagieren. Die erforderliche Korrektur müßte daher mittels anderer politischer Variablen erfolgen, zum Beispiel durch finanzpolitische und strukturelle Maßnahmen. Diese Veränderungen im Handlungsrahmen der teilnehmenden Länder wurden größtenteils jedoch schon frühzeitig auf dem Weg zur Verwirklichung der Währungsunion vorweggenommen. Der Wechselkurs wurde in den meisten teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten in den letzten Jahren überhaupt nicht mehr als ein Instrument nationaler Politik eingesetzt. Die aus früheren Wechselkursturbulenzen in Europa gezogene Lehre ist, daß der aktive Einsatz dieses politischen Instruments in der Regel mehr kostet als nützt, handelt es sich doch um ein \\x93kurzfristiges\\x94 Instrument, auf das häufig als Notlösung zurückgegriffen wurde, anstatt die zugrundeliegenden strukturellen Probleme der Wirtschaft anzugehen. Die Wirtschaft gerät nämlich leicht in Abhängigkeit von regelmäßigen Währungsabwertungen, was innerhalb kurzer Zeit zu erneuten Abwertungserwartungen, spekulativen Attacken, geringerer Glaubwürdigkeit und höheren Zinsen führt. Zur Stärkung der Glaubwürdigkeit und zur Gewährleistung der Lebensfähigkeit der Währungsunion war es deshalb erforderlich, zunächst einen ausreichenden Grad nominaler Konvergenz zwischen den teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten zu schaffen. In dieser Hinsicht stellten die für die Teilnahme an der Währungsunion aufgestellten Konvergenzkriterien einen starken Anreiz für die EU-Mitgliedstaaten dar, eine stabilitätsorientierte Politik mit dem Ziel der Erreichung von Preisstabilität und einer höheren Haushaltsdisziplin zu verfolgen. Sie boten ferner einen Anreiz für die Einleitung von Reformen zur Bewältigung der vorhandenen Strukturprobleme. Diese Strukturprobleme waren es nämlich, die die Wachstumsperspektiven vieler europäischer Länder stark beeinträchtigten und die Arbeitslosigkeit auf ein hohes Niveau ansteigen ließen. Ich bin grundsätzlich der Auffassung, daß ein sehr wichtiger positiver Effekt des Konvergenzprozesses der bemerkenswerte Konsens war, der unter den politischen Entscheidungsträgern und auch in der breiten Öffentlichkeit hinsichtlich der Notwendigkeit der Verfolgung einer soliden makroökonomischen Politik entstand, was bedeutet, daß die Geldpolitik primär auf die Gewährleistung von Preisstabilität und die Finanzpolitik auf die Sicherung eines mittel- und langfristig tragfähigen Haushalts ausgerichtet sein sollte und daß Strukturreformen, insbesondere Arbeitsmarktreformen, zur Erreichung eines dauer-haften, inflationsfreien Wirtschaftswachstums und zur Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen unerläßlich sind. Im Rückblick, so meine ich, stimmen wir wohl alle darin überein, daß der Konvergenzprozeß auf dem Wege zur Währungsunion sehr erfolgreich verlaufen ist. Tatsächlich haben sich die Inflationsraten und Zinsen nicht nur angeglichen, sie sind sogar auf ein Niveau zurückgegangen, das aus europäischer Sicht als historischer Tiefstand zu bezeichnen ist. Gleichzeitig sind die Wechselkurse der Währungen der teilnehmenden Mitgliedstaaten über eine langen Zeitraum hinweg in der Nähe der jeweiligen Paritäten des Wechselkursmechanismus, die den vorab bekanntgegebenen Umrechnungskursen entsprechen, stabil geblieben. Der Konvergenzprozeß war auch für die in den letzten Jahren zu verzeichnende Rückführung sowohl der öffentlichen Haushaltsdefizite als auch der Staatsverschuldung maßgebend, wobei die Erfolge im Haushaltsbereich angesichts der relativ günstigen Konjunktur in Europa allerdings größer hätten sein können. Insgesamt haben wir einen in Europa noch nie zuvor erzielten Grad nominaler Konvergenz erreicht. Gleichzeitig scheinen auch die Konjunkturzyklen in den Teilnehmerstaaten ein größeres Maß an Synchronität aufzuweisen als zuvor. Diese Entwicklungen haben eine solide wirtschaftliche Basis für die Einführung des Euro geschaffen. Die positiven Auswirkungen dieses Prozesses traten im Zuge der jüngsten Krisen an den Finanzmärkten klar zutage. Die Wechselkurse und auch das Zinsgefälle blieben im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet selbst dann weitgehend unverändert, als die Turbulenzen am heftigsten waren. Dies kann als deutliches Zeichen des Vertrauens der Marktteilnehmer in den Euro interpretiert werden. Allerdings können wir es uns nicht leisten, in unserem Konvergenzbemühungen nachzulassen, sobald die Währungsunion verwirklicht worden ist. Das Gegenteil trifft zu. Um sicherzustellen, daß der Währungs-union auch langfristig Erfolg beschieden wird, ist es notwendig, die strenge Haushaltsdisziplin beizubehalten und verstärkte Anstrengungen zur Umsetzung von Strukturreformen zu unternehmen. Nur so werden sich Spannungen innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets verhindern lassen. Wir müssen uns vergegenwärtigen, daß die im Rahmen des Konvergenzprozesses erzielten Erfolge durch den wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung begünstigt wurden, der sich in den vergangenen 4 bis 5 Jahren auf ganz Europa erstreckte. Die politischen Entscheidungsträger müssen jedoch dafür gerüstet sein zu gewährleisten, daß eine solide makroökonomische Politik auch dann fortbestehen bzw. beibehalten werden kann, wenn das Euro-Währungsgebiet von einem Wirtschaftsabschwung erfaßt werden sollte. Genau dies hatte der Europäische Rat im Juni 1997 im Sinn, als er den sogenannten Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt beschloß. In diesem Pakt sind 3 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukt (BIP) als Obergrenze für öffentlichen Haushaltsdefizite der am Euro-Währungsgebiet teilnehmenden Staaten vorgesehen. Damit präzisiert der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt die im Maastrichter Vertrag bereits festgelegten Regelungen zur gemeinsamen Überwachung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung und das für den Fall eines übermäßigen Haushaltsdefizits in einem oder mehreren der Mitgliedstaaten vorgesehene Verfahren. Darüber hinaus gibt der Pakt den Mitgliedstaaten als Ziel vor, die öffentlichen Haushalte mittelfristig nahezu auszugleichen oder sogar einen Haushaltsüberschuß zu erwirtschaften sowie Korrektur-maßnahmen zur Verhinderung eines übermäßigen Defizits zu ergreifen. Kritiker wenden zuweilen ein, der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt schränke die Möglichkeiten der Regierungen, einem wirtschaftlichen Abschwung mittels finanzpolitischer Maßnahmen zu begegnen, übermäßig ein. Meiner Ansicht nach handelt es sich hier jedoch um ein völliges Mißverständnis. Tatsächlich ist die strikte Einhaltung der Zielvorgaben des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts eine unabdingbare Voraussetzung zur Wiederherstellung eines finanzpolitischen Handlungsspielraums. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten ließ man es zu, daß automatische Stabilisatoren in Zeiten der Rezession in ganz Europa nahezu ihre volle Wirkung entfalten konnten, während man in Zeiten starken Wirtschaftswachstums nur unzureichende Maßnahmen zur Korrektur der Haushaltssituation ergriffen hat. Deshalb ist die in Prozent des BIP ausgedrückte Staatsverschuldung in den letzten 30 Jahren fast kontinuierlich angestiegen, und zwar auf ein so hohes Niveau, daß es nahezu keinen finanzpolitischen Handlungsspielraum mehr gab. Dies wurde vor allem während der Rezession zu Beginn der neunziger Jahre deutlich, als einige Länder aufgrund der Notwendigkeit der Wiederherstellung des Vertrauens in die Finanzpolitik gezwungen wurden, eine prozyklische Politik zu verfolgen. Anlaß zur Sorge ist der hohe Grad der öffentlichen Verschuldung insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Herausforderungen, die sich längerfristig daraus ergeben, daß die Menschen in Europa zunehmend älter werden. Die Staatsverschuldung im Euro-Währungsgebiet wird deshalb erheblich reduziert werden müssen, ehe das Instrument der Finanzpolitik wieder wirksam eingesetzt werden kann. Der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt wurde daher nicht nur aufgrund der Erfordernisse im Hinblick auf die Schaffung der Währungsunion vereinbart. Die impliziten finanzpolitischen Beschränkungen des Pakts wären angesichts des Zustands der öffentlichen Finanzen in der EU in jedem Fall erforderlich gewesen. Wird das mittelfristige Ziel des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts erreicht, nämlich nahezu ausgeglichene oder einen Überschuß ausweisende Staatshaushalte, würde damit auch genügend Handlungsspielraum geschaffen, um es automatischen Stabilisatoren zu ermöglichen, einen wirtschaftlichen Abschwungs abzufedern, ohne die Defizite der öffentlichen Haushalte über die Höchstgrenze von 3 % des BIP ansteigen zu lassen. Bei aller Anerkennung der Fortschritte, die im Hinblick auf die Stabilitätsorientierung der Politik und das hohe Maß an erreichter nominaler Konvergenz erzielt worden sind, müssen wir aber auch eingestehen, daß die Wirtschaftspolitik bisher weitgehend außerstande war, eines der größten volkswirtschaftlichen Probleme im Euro-Währungsgebiet zu lösen: Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist immer noch inakzeptabel hoch. Trotz eines über einige Jahre hinweg andauernden Wirtschaftsaufschwungs ist sie im Euro-Währungsgebiet nur geringfügig zurückgegangen. Die Einführung des Euro und die Durchführung der einheitlichen Geldpolitik werden für sich genommen kein Allheilmittel für das Problem der Arbeitslosigkeit sein können. Die Geldpolitik ist weder Ursache noch Lösung dieses Problems. Die Arbeitslosigkeit kann vielmehr nur durch Strukturreformen bekämpft werden, die darauf abzielen, die Arbeitsmärkte effizienter zu machen. Ich meine, dieser Schluß liegt auf der Hand, wenn man die Länder Europas miteinander vergleicht. In jenen Ländern, die bereits strukturelle Reformen zur Erhöhung der Flexibilität an den Arbeitsmärkten umgesetzt haben, ist die Arbeitslosigkeit erheblich stärker zurück-gegangen als in jenen, in denen solche Reformen noch ausstehen. Dem steht nicht entgegen, daß es ein wichtiges Anliegen der einheitlichen Geldpolitik ist, zur Schaffung eines wirtschaftlichen Umfelds beizutragen, das Wachstum und Beschäftigung fördert. Der beste Beitrag, den das ESZB in dieser Hinsicht leisten kann, ist die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität, vorausgesetzt, daß andere politische Maßnahmen angemessen greifen. Neben diesen makroökonomischen Implikationen kann der Euro in den am Euro-Währungsgebiet teilnehmenden Staaten jedoch auch auf mikroökonomischer Ebene deutlich positive Auswirkungen nach sich ziehen.      Der Euro \\xad Die Auswirkungen auf das Unternehmensumfeld in Europa    Es ist in der Tat möglich, daß die mikroökonomischen Konsequenzen der Einführung des Euro im Hinblick auf die Verbesserung des langfristigen Wachstumspotentials und damit der Beschäftigungs-aussichten in den Volkswirtschaften der am Euro-Währungsgebiet teilnehmenden Staaten sogar von noch größerer Bedeutung sind als die makroökonomischen. Allerdings läßt sich das Ausmaß dieser mikroökonomischen Auswirkungen nur schwer vorhersagen. Einige Vorteile der neuen einheitlichen Währung liegen auf der Hand. So ist zum Beispiel offensichtlich, daß die Verwendung einer einheitlichen Währung im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet die unmittelbaren Transaktionskosten der grenzüberschreitenden Zahlungen sowohl für die Verbraucher als auch die Unternehmen reduzieren wird. Klar ist auch, daß der Wegfall von Wechselkursrisiken bei Geschäften innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets zu niedrigeren Kosten für die Unternehmen und damit letztlich auch für die Verbraucher führen wird. Vielleicht noch wichtiger ist dabei aber, daß der Wegfall der Wechselkurs-risiken die mit langfristigen, grenzüberschreitenden Investitionen verbundenen Risiken innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets beträchtlich sinken lassen wird. Andere Vorteile sind weniger offensichtlich. Zum Beispiel könnte allein die Tatsache, daß überall dieselbe Währung benutzt wird, kleine und mittlere Unternehmen mit begrenzter Erfahrung im Umgang mit fremden Währungen dazu ermutigen, den Schritt in neue Märkte innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets zu wagen. Dies würde zu einem verstärkten Wettbewerb innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets beitragen. Ein weiterer wichtiger Faktor, der wahrscheinlich zur Förderung des Wettbewerbs innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets beitragen wird, dürfte die Tatsache sein, daß der Euro grenzüberschreitend zu einer höheren Preistransparenz führen wird. Bisher waren die Märkte für viele Arten von Waren und Dienstleistungen, nicht zuletzt auch die für Finanzdienstleistungen, in den einzelnen Ländern unterschiedlich strukturiert. Die Einführung einer einheitlichen Währung wird Preisunterschiede hervortreten lassen und ein weiterer Anreiz sowohl für die Verbraucher als auch für professionelle Einkäufer sein, günstigere Anbieter in einem benachbarten Land zu suchen. Zusammengenommen dürften all diese Faktoren den europäischen Binnenmarkt für Waren und Dienstleistungen voraussichtlich beträchtlich stärken. Ferner werden sie Unternehmen einen Anreiz bieten, sich innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets durch Errichtung gemeinsamer Niederlassungen sowie durch Fusionen und Akquisitionen zusammenzuschließen. Investoren werden sich künftig bei der Beurteilung von Anlagemöglichkeiten voraussichtlich mehr auf sektor- als auf länderspezifische Entwicklungen konzentrieren. Das grenzüberschreitende Zusammenwirken von Unternehmen wird deshalb zu höherer Effizienz, mehr Wettbewerb und niedrigeren Kosten führen und damit zur Dämpfung des Preisdrucks beitragen. Am deutlichsten dürfte sich dies in jenen Wirtschaftsbereichen auswirken, in denen in den Mitgliedstaaten noch eine starke Segmentierung vorherrscht. In diesem Zusammenhang steht zu erwarten, daß die Auswirkungen der Einführung des Euro wahrscheinlich am deutlichsten und schnellsten im Finanzsektor zu Tage treten werden.      Der Euro - Die Auswirkungen auf die Finanzmärkte in Europa    Die mit der Einführung des Euro verbundenen Auswirkungen auf den Finanzmärkten stehen in einem direkteren Zusammenhang mit den Aktivitäten des ESZB, als dies bei anderen Wirtschaftssektoren der Fall sein wird. Ich möchte deshalb gern näher auf einige Bereiche eingehen, in denen die Geldpolitik des ESZB die Funktionsweise der Finanzmärkte im Euro-Währungsgebiet wahrscheinlich unmittelbar beeinflussen wird. Erstens: Die Durchführung einer einheitlichen Geldpolitik wird wohl umgehend zu einem völlig integrierten Geldmarkt innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets führen. Ermöglicht wird diese Integration der bestehenden nationalen Geldmärkte durch das sogenannte TARGET-System, über das die nationalen Zahlungsverkehrssysteme im Euro-Währungsgebiet miteinander verbunden werden. Dadurch werden die grenzüberschreitenden Geschäfte der Banken und ihr Zugang zu Euro-Geldern erleichtert. Die Zinssätze innerhalb des das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet umfassenden Geldmarkts werden im wesentlichen eher die unterschiedlichen Solvenzrisiken zwischen den teilnehmenden Banken als länderspezifischer Faktoren widerspiegeln. Zweitens: Zur Förderung der Entwicklung eines integrierten Geldmarkts hat das ESZB einen markt-orientierten Handlungsrahmen für die Durchführung der einheitlichen Geldpolitik erarbeitet. Darin wird regelmäßigen, befristeten Pensionsgeschäfte, die im Tenderverfahren vergebenen werden, ein besonders großes Gewicht eingeräumt. Das Hervorheben des Instruments befristeter Pensionsgeschäfte wird wohl einen Anreiz für die Schaffung eines das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet umfassenden Interbanken-Repomarkts sowie zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt eventuell auch eines privaten Repomarkts bieten, in dem Banken und Nichtbanken kurzfristige, mit Wertpapieren besicherte Refinanzierungsgeschäfte im Rahmen ihrer täglichen Liquiditätssteuerung abschließen können. Drittens: Das ESZB wird ferner ein Mindestreservesystem zur Stabilisierung der Geldmarktsätze und Ausweitung des strukturellen Defizits im Bankensektor einsetzen, wobei ich diesbezüglich unterstreichen möchte, daß das ESZB bei der Errichtung des Mindestreservesystems besonderen Wert darauf gelegt hat, daß dieses mit den Marktgrundsätzen vereinbar ist. So werden die Mindestreserveeinlagen beispielsweise mit dem für das wichtigste Refinanzierungsinstrument des ESZB geltenden Satz verzinst, und die Erfüllung der Mindestreservepflicht berechnet sich nach der durchschnittlichen Höhe der Einlagen über die einen Monat laufende Mindestreserveerfüllungsperiode. Mit diesen Regelungen soll verhindert werden, daß das Mindestreservesystem zu einer Verlagerung von Finanzgeschäften an Finanzzentren außerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets führt. Gleichzeitig bieten sie ein Instrument zur Stabilisierung der Geldmarktzinssätze, ohne daß häufige Feinsteuerungsinterventionen seitens des ESZB erforderlich werden. Viertens: Das ESZB wird ein breites Spektrum von öffentlichen und privaten Wertpapieren als Sicherheiten für seine Kreditoperationen akzeptieren. Es wird seinen Geschäftspartnern ferner die Möglichkeit zur grenzüberschreitenden Hinterlegung von Sicherheiten innerhalb des Euro-Währungsgebiets einräumen. Dieser Ansatz dürfte wahrscheinlich zu positiven Impulsen im Hinblick auf die Entwicklung von Märkten für private Wertpapiere, die Portefeuillediversifizierung innerhalb des gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiets und die Integration der Kapitalmärkte führen. Fünftens: Die Integration der Finanzmärkte wird auch von den Aktivitäten des ESZB zur Harmonisierung von Konventionen und Standards bezüglich der Marktpraktiken in dem das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet umfassenden Geldmarkt profitieren. Zweifellos ist der Beginn der Währungsunion ein großer Schritt in Richtung auf eine generelle Harmonisierung der Marktpraktiken in der EU, die zu gegebener Zeit auch andere Marktsegmente wie zum Beispiel die Renten- und Aktienmärkte erfassen wird. Eine solche Harmonisierung wird allgemein zu einer effektiveren Preisbildung führen und zur Schaffung effizienterer Finanzmärkte beitragen. Grundsätzlich könnten zunehmend integriertere Geld- und Kapitalmärkte die Entstehung von Märkten für \\x93Commercial Paper\\x94 und Unternehmensschuldtitel im Euro-Währungsgebiet fördern. Ein auf Staatsanleihen basierender \\x93Benchmark\\x94 (Referenzwert), zunehmende Größenvorteile, engere Spannen zwischen Brief- und Geldkursen, niedrige Kosten für die Absicherung von Schuldtiteln privater Unternehmen und ein verstärkter Wettbewerb im Emissionsgeschäft dürften voraussichtlich positive Anreize für Unternehmen darstellen, eigene Anleihen zu emittieren anstatt Kredite bei Banken aufzunehmen, während Anleger auf der Suche nach attraktiven Renditen solche Wertpapiere interessant finden werden. Auch die Emission von Aktien bzw. der Handel mit Aktien könnte zur gegebenen Zeit das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet umspannen. Die Implikationen der Einführung des Euro in bezug auf die Entwicklung der europäischen Finanzmärkte dürften insgesamt zu einer stärkeren und effizienteren Mobilisierung von Sparguthaben bzw. zur Umleitung dieser Guthaben in produktive Anlageformen führen. Auf lange Sicht wird sich dies positiv auf das Wachstumspotential innerhalb des gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiets auswirken.      Schlußbemerkungen    In meinem heutigen Vortrag habe ich mich bemüht, einige der wichtigsten Argumente für die Einführung der einheitlichen Währung aus drei unterschiedlichen Perspektiven zu beleuchten, nämlich aus \\x93makroökonischer\\x94 Sicht, aus \\x93mikroökonomischer\\x94 Sicht und aus Sicht der \\x93Finanzmärkte\\x94. Ich bin mir allerdings bewußt, daß die Bemühungen um Integration in Europa nicht nur mit derartigen wirtschafts- und finanzspezifischen Argumenten begründet werden dürfen. Von noch größerer Bedeu-tung ist der dem allgemeinen Streben nach europäischer Integration zugrundeliegende politische Wunsch nach Sicherung des Friedens und der Stabilität in Europa. Ich bin davon überzeugt, daß die Einführung des Euro einen überaus wichtigen Schritt auf diesem Wege darstellt und daß das mit der Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität betraute ESZB dazu beitragen wird, Wohlstand, Stabilität und Frieden in Europa zu sichern. Mit dieser Vision vor Augen darf ich Ihnen versichern, daß das ESZB jede Anstrengung auf sich nehmen wird, um einen reibungslosen und erfolgreichen Start des Euro am 1. Januar 1999 zu gewährleisten  ']\n",
      "['1998-10-22', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The international role of the euro', 'Speech presented by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, at the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, Berlin', '  The international role of the euro   Speech presented by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, at the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, Berlin The introduction of the euro is undoubtedly the most profound change in the international monetary system since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. It is therefore understandable that a great deal of interest is being shown in the prospective role of the euro as an international currency and its implications, not least for the monetary policy of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) (that is, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro area national central banks). In my presentation this evening, I shall try to shed some light on these issues by examining the developing role of the euro as a reserve and international currency, its relation with the monetary and exchange rate policy of the ESCB, some specific policy issues and its impact on the international monetary system. My principal conclusion is that there is little doubt that Monetary Union will entail an expanded role for the euro in the global arena relative to its constituent currencies. The ESCB will not shy away from the role that this development implies; it will contribute to the international policy discussions from the perspective of price stability in the euro area being its prime objective and, at the same time, the best longer-term contribution which it can make to stable international developments.       1. The euro as a reserve currency    The developing role of the euro as a currency may usefully be linked to the differing functions of money, notably as a store of value and a medium of exchange. One aspect of the international role of the euro will be its evolving use as a reserve asset (a store of value) and an instrument of intervention (a medium of exchange) by central banks. At present, the US dollar remains the by far most important reserve currency world-wide. According to data for the end of 1996, the share of dollar-denominated official reserves amounts to 64%, while euro area currencies account for 25% and the Japanese yen for 6%. As far as the future share of the euro in overall official reserves is concerned, it seems plausible to expect that the national central banks of non-euro area countries will generally re-assess their reserve management strategy in light of the improved global diversification opportunities offered by holding an increased share of their portfolios in this new currency. The euro will be of particular importance as a reserve asset to those other European countries which, formally or informally, intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a (trade-weighted) basket of currencies including the euro as a large component. This may hold true not only for countries participating in the new European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), but also for transition countries in central and eastern Europe and possibly for non-EU Mediterranean countries as well as for Switzerland and Norway. Meanwhile, the euro may in future come to represent a more important part of foreign currency reserves held by Asian central banks, which include at present mainly US dollar assets. Whether and to what extent this will happen depends, however, crucially on confidence in the ESCB\\'s monetary policy and the euro\\'s stability. As regards official reserve holdings in the future euro area, it has been argued that the introduction of the euro would generate so-called \"excess reserves\" within Europe. This is distinct from the issue that there will be an automatic fall in the euro\\'s share of world reserves since some EU countries\\' reserves formerly held in Deutsche Marks will become \"domestic euro assets\". The main argument is that the degree of external openness of the euro area will be much lower than that currently prevailing in each of the future participating economies. As a result, the need for official reserves, as assessed on the basis of future euro area exports, should significantly decline. However, while not entirely dismissing this argument, I would suggest that the appropriate level of official reserves chosen by central banks depends on many more factors than suggested by this line of reasoning - for example, financial integration and the ease with which institutional investors can mobilise huge amounts within a brief period of time have increased the level of reserves needed for effective intervention, there is a need for reserves to take part in any concerted intervention that may be agreed and there is the \"reputation effect\" of substantial reserve holdings. Particularly given the uncertainties prevailing at the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), caution is likely to be the watchword in this regard. I should stress that although reserve-management aspects have tended to receive a great deal of attention in respect of the future role of the euro, I believe that private portfolio flows and the prospective adoption of the euro as a vehicle currency will be predominant factors in the euro\\'s prospective internationalisation. It is to these topics that I now turn.       2. The euro as an international investment currency    As is the case for foreign exchange reserves, the US dollar is at present the dominant investment currency in the global capital market, although some decline of its position as a store of value for private investors is already apparent. The share of dollar-denominated international bonds and notes amounted to 46% at end-June 1998, followed by the yen (11%) and the Deutsche Mark (10%), whereas all euro area currencies taken together accounted for 24%. A similar pattern can also be found for the denomination structure of international bank assets and liabilities. By contrast, the falling share of the US dollar even before the start of Stage Three of EMU can be seen from the fact that between 1981 and 1995, EU currencies\\' share of world private portfolios rose from 13% to 37%, while the US dollar\\'s share fell from 67% to 40%. There are strong arguments to suggest that private investors will in future hold a greater proportion of their portfolios in euro assets than they have done in the constituent currencies to date. A key element in the potential attractiveness of the euro as an investment currency will be the emergence of large and integrated financial markets in the euro area as the euro removes currency-related fragmentation in the euro area and induces the establishment of uniform market standards. Market liquidity should benefit from this integration, thus inducing a virtuous cycle of increasing issuance and investment in euro instruments by domestic and foreign institutions. In particular, at the short end of the yield curve, the necessary conditions for the creation of a broad, deep and liquid European money market are likely to be met. The operational framework for monetary policy, with the major instrument being open market operations based on reverse transactions, will foster money market integration. Integration will be supported by the implementation of the TARGET system of interlinked real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of the participating countries. This will ensure a common overnight interest rate throughout the euro area, a smooth settlement of cross-border payments in the euro area and a reduction of systemic risks that might arise from settlement failures. TARGET will also be available to non-euro area banks for exchanging intraday liquidity in euro, albeit only subject to strict conditions being met. The introduction of the euro should also have favourable implications for bond markets by increasing market liquidity, broadening the range of maturities and potentially offering a wider variety of financial products. Nevertheless, capital markets are likely to remain more fragmented at the long end of the yield curve than at the short end, despite the redenomination on 1 January 1999 of outstanding government debt into euro. Credit spreads between euro government bonds are likely to prevail even after the start of Stage Three of EMU, reflecting differences in credit assessments based on the respective fiscal position of governments in the euro area, including future pension obligations, and hence giving appropriate market signals. Moreover, differences in national issuing procedures, market practices and conventions as well as fiscal differences mean that the euro bond market may take time to reach the level of homogeneity of the US bond market. Meanwhile, increasingly integrated money and government bond markets may stimulate the emergence of commercial paper and corporate bond markets in the euro area. A benchmark of government bonds or of swap rates, increasing economies of scale, narrower bid-ask spreads, lower hedging costs for debt securities issued by private firms and more competitive underwriting are likely to provide incentives for corporations to issue their own securities instead of borrowing from banks, while investors in search of a yield pick-up will find such securities attractive. Equity issuance and trading may also in due course become euro area-wide. Likewise, on the deposit side, a rapidly developing private repo or investment fund market in euro could become a serious alternative to traditional bank deposits for large investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. The development of such new market segments is likely to attract both international investors and borrowers. A further issue which will influence internationalisation is the risk, return and diversification characteristics of the euro. One such aspect is that the euro should offer international investors and borrowers from outside the EU an attractive real rate of return adjusted for risk. Such an attractive risk/return profile should be enhanced by stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies and the ESCB\\'s independence, thus protecting holders against losses in purchasing power. Meanwhile, whether the euro would offer more or fewer opportunities for diversification than the situation in Stage Two is very difficult to predict, since it would depend on both the variances and the co-variances of the returns on assets denominated in euro and in other currencies. On the one hand, Monetary Union may induce a greater independence of euro yields vis-à-vis those of the United States, increasing diversification benefits. On the other, a case can be made that with the elimination of exchange risk premia and the adoption of a single monetary policy, investors in bonds of euro area countries are likely to lose some diversification benefits which are currently available to them. However, for the countries that have long maintained stable exchange rates, this loss of diversification benefits may, to a large extent, have already taken place. It is difficult to predict, a priori, the net effect of these influences on the demand for euro.       3. The euro as a transaction and vehicle currency    A further aspect of the internationalisation of the euro will be its developing role as a transaction and vehicle currency for cross-border transactions, i.e. as a medium of exchange, outside the euro area. Today, the US dollar is the most important transaction and vehicle currency. In foreign exchange markets, 71% of all spot transactions involved the dollar on one side of the deal, compared with 68% for euro area currencies, 22% for the yen and 39% for other currencies. The US dollar\\'s share is considerably higher - over 80% - when derivatives transactions are also included. With respect to the invoicing of international trade, estimates suggest that in the early 1990s about one half of global exports were invoiced in US dollar, roughly one third was denominated in euro area currencies and only 5% in Japanese yen. Initially, following the introduction of the euro, its market share in foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade will decline \"automatically, as a result of the purely mechanical effect of eliminating intra-euro area trade, which amounts to over 60% of total external trade of the future euro area countries. Its share could fall to around 20% for the invoicing of foreign trade and 56% for spot foreign exchange transactions. However, notably in respect of trade, the expected decline is likely to be a short-term development. In a medium-term perspective, the decline is likely to be offset, as international trade flows both between euro area and non-euro area countries, as well as euro-denominated trade between non-euro area residents increase. It is of interest to note in this context that according to recent press reports, some companies in non-euro area European countries such as Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Switzerland are considering switching wholly or partly to operations in euro. Nevertheless, at the global level it will clearly take time for the euro to attain a comparable stature to the dollar as a vehicle currency. Note that the value of US dollar-denominated international trade is nearly four times higher than US exports. As this ratio indicates, the use of the US dollar as an international currency on the goods and financial markets is less related to trade shares than to the convenience of using one standard currency - in other words, there are economies of scale. In this context, it is worth noting that it took several decades before the US dollar, as the currency of the largest economy in the world since the end of the last century, became the most important vehicle currency, replacing the pound. Thus, sterling was used as a standard despite the declining economic and trade weight of the United Kingdom.       4. The euro, exchange rate policy and monetary policy    The arguments that I have presented so far suggest that the euro will indeed become an international currency, albeit at different rates in different domains. As regards the approach of the ESCB to these matters, I should state quite categorically that its overriding objective is price stability for the euro area as a whole; there are no plans whatsoever to stimulate the use of the euro as an international currency, to use the euro as an instrument of foreign policy, or to rival the US dollar. Nevertheless we have to acknowledge that the euro will become an important international currency merely by the operation of market forces as outlined above. This role will probably develop gradually over time, at a pace linked to the success of the ESCB in maintaining price stability. In this context, it is important to stress the role which the euro\\'s exchange rate will play in the conduct of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy. At its meeting in December 1997 in Luxembourg, the European Council stressed in its conclusions that the exchange rate of the euro would be heavily influenced by the economic fundamentals of the euro area relative to those of other countries. In broad terms, this implies that the exchange rate should be seen as the outcome of all relevant economic policies rather than as an objective to be set independently. Underlying this position is of course the Treaty establishing the European Community, according to which the ESCB\\'s primary objective is to maintain price stability. For the ESCB this objective will have pre-eminence over other policy objectives, including possible exchange rate targets. Equally, the EMI\\'s Report entitled \"The Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three\" concluded that an exchange rate objective for monetary policy would not be appropriate for an area as large as the euro area, because it might not be consistent with the objective of price stability. Indeed, as I announced last week, the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy that the ECB will adopt involves a prominent role for money with a reference value for the growth of a monetary aggregate and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for future price developments. In addition, I announced a quantitative definition of the primary objective of the single monetary policy, price stability, namely a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Following the same line of reasoning, although the Treaty provides for various possible exchange rate arrangements, the European Council also concluded in December last year that so-called \"general orientations\" for the exchange rate policy of the euro area may only be formulated in exceptional circumstances, for example, in the case of a clear misalignment. This implies that in normal circumstances and in the absence of formal exchange rate arrangements between the euro and other major currencies, the ESCB alone will be in charge of the implementation of exchange rate policy in the euro area. The ECB will of course monitor exchange rates as part of its overall assessment of a broad range of economic and financial indicators which are relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and respond wherever necessary - in other words, there will be no \"benign neglect\".       5. Policy issues raised by internationalisation    Having an international currency has advantages for economic agents, but may sometimes complicate monetary policy. For example, one aspect is that the currency is circulating to a much greater extent outside the own-currency area. This makes monetary aggregates harder to interpret and control. Such holdings may aggravate any distortions to the relationship between money and economic variables that could result from the \"structural break\" that Monetary Union may represent. Furthermore, there has been some debate as to whether the euro could initially be vulnerable to transitional problems owing to portfolio shifts. Certainly, it cannot be totally ruled out that large movements in the value of the dollar may have undesirable effects on the domestic situation of the euro area, at a time when the ESCB would be in the process of establishing its credibility. They may also have spillover effects on ERM II. The ESCB will, of course, be vigilant in respect of the potential consequences of such shifts for domestic monetary stability. However, there could be offsetting stabilising effects from capital flows at the beginning of Stage Three, not least because the attraction of the euro will be both on the assets and the liabilities side. More generally, there is the issue of managed floating and target zones. Some view exchange rate management as a desirable goal of international policy co-ordination, and also one that will become more feasible with the introduction of the euro. I take a less favourable view, as I shall now explain: Following the end of the Bretton Woods system, for almost 25 years now exchange rate relationships among the main currency blocs (the United States, Japan and the Deutsche Mark area) have been characterised by floating exchange rates and a de facto multi-polar international monetary system. This situation has reflected a number of important changes in the economic context relative to the one prevailing in the early years of the Bretton Woods system, notably a greater balance in the relative economic size of the main industrial countries and the tendency of the largest countries - and in future the euro area countries - to aim their monetary policies primarily at domestic objectives. At the same time, the liberalisation of capital movements has drastically diminished the ability of central banks and governments to control exchange rate movements. The priority assigned by large countries and currency areas to domestic objectives explains why in recent years policy co-ordination among the three main currency blocs has been essentially of a non-binding nature. Since the end of the Bretton Woods system and the move to floating rates, the three main currency areas have nevertheless occasionally taken ad hoc measures to correct exchange rate misalignments or to stabilise exchange rate levels. Examples of co-ordinated actions agreed by the main industrial countries have been the Plaza Agreement (September 1985) and the Louvre Accord (February 1987). However, these countries have always refrained from committing themselves to formal exchange rate arrangements or pre-defined rules for their management. I would acknowledge that within the limits set by its voluntary and ad hoc nature, policy co-ordination has in some cases proved effective in managing exchange rates. Joint policy action has notably been effective in specific situations, for example in the presence of speculative \"bubbles\" or of a high degree of uncertainty regarding the correct interpretation of fundamentals. Nevertheless, there remains deep concern, which I share, about the potential implications of such arrangements for monetary stability at the domestic level. The simple point is that they may well limit the scope for action and independence of monetary policy makers in a manner that would not be in conformity with equilibrium in the domestic economy. The current predicament of Japan may be partly traced back to its willingness to maintain an expansionary monetary policy in the late 1980s, in order to weaken the yen, which, in retrospect, fuelled credit expansion and asset price inflation, and, in due course, price inflation per se. Likewise, the boom in the United Kingdom in the same period, which eventually required severe monetary tightening, can be partly traced back to attempts to shadow the Deutsche Mark despite upward pressures on the currency. On balance, I would urge that discretionary action in this field should be entered into with considerable caution, and ill-advised or inconsistent action may have far worse consequences than largely leaving market forces to play themselves out, while strictly maintaining price stability at home. Moreover, even if all those concerned were to maintain price stability, there may well be justified shifts in exchange rates linked to cyclical differences between the major blocs. Total exchange rate stability at the global level may thus be neither attainable nor desirable.       6. The euro and the international monetary system    Discussion of policy co-ordination leads on to my final topic, namely the impact which Monetary Union may have on the development of the international monetary system itself. I note immediately that both the direction of these effects and the time that may be needed for them to be felt in full are difficult to predict. I shall make no comment on recent criticisms or proposals for reform of the system, but would rather prefer to highlight the underlying forces at work in promoting the weight of the euro. First, the greater cyclical synchronisation of the euro area (linked, inter alia, to a single monetary policy and common exchange rate), together with its size, will make economic developments in the euro area of considerable importance to the world. Moreover, the action of the ESCB will be made more important than those of the individual EU national central banks in the past. Second, the joining of a number of large industrial countries in a single currency area will reduce the number of major currency blocs in the global financial system. In principle, this should simplify the decision-making process on financial and economic issues at the international level. However, the net effect will also depend on the implementation of a unified internal decision-making process and external representation for the euro area. Third, the large size of the euro area will create a greater balance in the relative size of players in the global economy (the United States, the euro area and Japan). Each of the main players will be in a position to have a greater effect on the shape of the system than they had when Europe was fragmented and, at the same time, they will be more or less equally vulnerable to the possible consequences of instability. They may thus have enhanced incentives to take on a share of the responsibility for managing and preventing it. In the context of these developments, the ECB, acting on behalf of the ESCB, will clearly have an important role in international policy discussions, comparable to the current role of the US Federal Reserve. We shall not walk away from that role. Indeed, the ECB is already beginning to play a certain role at international meetings such as those at the BIS/G-10, IMF, OECD and in a G-7 context. This role will gain increased weight over time, There remain a number of unresolved issues in this area, but progress is being made on ensuring that practical and workable arrangements will be agreed - and they will evolve over time. Moreover, it has to be recognised that the ECB is not yet operational and also that the international role of the euro will develop over time. In all relevant fora, the ECB\\'s role will be to contribute to the international policy discussions from the perspective of price stability in the euro area being its prime objective and at the same time the best longer-term contribution which it can make to stable international developments.       Conclusion    There is little doubt that Monetary Union will entail an expanded role for the euro in the global arena relative to its constituent currencies. This will occur not least as a consequence of a profound restructuring of the euro area financial markets, which will make them more efficient and internationally competitive. However, the confidence in future internal and external stability of the euro will also play a crucial role. In this respect, although we shall take a neutral stance on this issue, I am convinced that the unambiguous mandate conferred upon the ESCB to maintain price stability and the ESCB\\'s institutional framework, which ensures a high degree of independence, will automatically foster the future international role of the euro. Changes in the structure of the international monetary system will take time to materialise, as past experience has shown in the case of the US dollar vis-à-vis the pound sterling. However, I am rather confident that the euro will indeed play a major role in the international financial arena. Our monetary policy will be the centre of attention in this context and our basic message will remain that the best means of securing stable exchange rates is fiscal and monetary stability.   ']\n",

Duisenberg am Luxembourg Finance Market Forum am 14. Oktober 1998 in Luxemburg', '  Die Europäische Währungsunion vor dem Start   Vortrag des Präsidenten der Europäischen Zentralbank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg am Luxembourg Finance Market Forum am 14. Oktober 1998 in Luxemburg Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! Gerne bin ich Ihrer Einladung zum Luxemburg Finanzmarkt-Forum gefolgt. Ich möchte Ihnen aus diesem Anlaß eine Situationsbeschreibung der \"Europäischen Währungsunion vor dem Start\" geben. Die wirtschaftliche Lage im Euro-Währungsgebiet und der Stand der Vorbereitungen für die Einführung des Euro und die einheitliche Geldpolitik sollen die Schwerpunkte meiner heutigen Ausführungen sein. Hierbei werde ich vor allem auf die besonders wichtigen Entscheidungen eingehen, die der Rat der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) gestern zur geldpolitischen Strategie getroffen hat.  Vierzig Jahre nach den ersten Plänen für eine gemeinsame Währung in Europa steht dieses historische Projekt unmittelbar vor seinem Start. Am 1. Januar 1999, in nur 78 Tagen also, beginnt die dritte Stufe der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. Ein einzigartiges Unterfangen, das in seiner Dynamik auch das Potential hat, die Europäische Integration auf dem Weg in das neue Jahrtausend entscheidend voranzubringen und zu festigen.  Wenn am 1.1.1999 der Euro vorerst in elf Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union eingeführt wird, dann startet die Währungsunion insgesamt auf einem guten Fundament. In einem mehrjährigen Prozeß mit deutlichen Fortschritten in der Konvergenz der wirtschaftlichen Daten der teilnehmenden Länder wurde eine vertretbare gemeinsame Basis für den Start der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion geschaffen.  Potentielle Risiken wurden durch verschiedene Regelungen im Maastricht-Vertrag und im Statut der Europäischen Zentralbank, die beide völkerrechtlich verbindlichen Charakter haben, begrenzt. Einen zusätzlichen Schutz bietet der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt sowie die Selbstverpflichtung der Finanzminister zur Haushaltskonsolidierung vom 1. Mai 1998.  Für die Bürger der Europäischen Union bedeutet die Einführung des Euro, von etwas Vertrautem, Altbewährten wie der heimischen Währung Abschied zu nehmen und sich auf etwas Neues und weitgehend Unbekanntes einzulassen. Doch je näher wir dem Start der Währungsunion rücken, je mehr Entscheidungen getroffen werden und je mehr Klarheit damit geschaffen wird, desto breiter wird die Unterstützung der Bevölkerung für die Währungsunion und den Euro. Zahlreiche Meinungsumfragen bestätigen diese Entwicklung.  Von seiten des Europäischen Systems der Zentralbanken (ESZB) laufen die Vorbereitungen für den Start der Währungsunion auf Hochtouren, um rechtzeitig zum 1.1.1999 die volle Funktionsfähigkeit der einheitlichen Geldpolitik gewährleisten zu können. Trotz des enormen Arbeitspensums und des erheblichen Zeitdrucks der Mitarbeiter der EZB und der beteiligten nationalen Zentralbanken, bin ich zuversichtlich, daß uns dies gelingen wird. Lassen Sie mich nun auf das gegenwärtige wirtschaftiche Umfeld der Geldpolitik zu sprechen kommen. Die globale wirtschaftliche und finanzielle Lage hat sich in letzter Zeit merklich eingetrübt. Die Finanzmarktkrise in Rußland, die Krise in Asien und ein negatives Wachstum in Japan haben zu starken Schwankungen und Korrekturen auf den Aktienmärkten geführt. Zumindest teilweise sind dies jedoch vermutlich Reaktionen auf vergangene übertreibungen. Nichtsdestoweniger ist es gegenwärtig schwierig zu beurteilen, wie groß die dämpfenden Auswirkungen dieser Turbulenzen auf Preise und Wirtschaftswachstum in der Euro-Zone sein werden. Angesichts des relativ geringen Aushandelsanteil der EU11-Staaten mit den Krisenregionen läßt sich vermuten, daß die direkten negativen Folgen für das Gebiet der zukünftigen Währungsunion und die Europäische Union begrenzt bleiben. Wir müssen uns aber auch bewußt sein, daß die mit den gegenwärtigen weltweiten Entwicklungen einhergehenden Risiken über die Auswirkungen hinausgehen können, die wir derzeit unmittelbar messen können. Hier mag man zum Beispiel an die indirekten Einflüsse denken, die ein verändertes Vertrauensklima und Spar- und Ausgabenverhalten im Euro-Währungsgebiet haben könnte. Vor dem Hintergrund \"gesunder\" wirtschaftlicher Fundamentaldaten für Europa sind allerdings nüchtern betrachtet wenig Gründe für einen spürbaren Vertrauensverlust in Sicht.  Nach Ansicht des EZB-Rates ist es als Reaktion auf die jüngsten wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen und die aktuellen Marktbedingungen unabdinglich, daß von politischem Aktionismus geprägte Lösungen, die der Komplexität der Fragen nicht ausreichend Rechnung tragen, vermieden werden. Dies würde nur dazu beitragen, daß den der derzeitigen Volatilität an den weltweiten Finanzmärkten zugrunde liegenden Unsicherheiten neue Nahrung gegeben wird. Allerdings ist der EZB-Rat auch der Ansicht, daß die Vorschläge, wieder über Kapitalverkehrskontrollen nachzudenken, keine akzeptable politische Lösung darstellen und daß die jüngsten Rufe nach weltweiten, einheitlichen Zinssenkungen unangemessen sind. Beide Vorschläge gehen den eigentlichen Problemen nicht auf den Grund. Vielmehr angezeigt, sind Strukturverbesserungen auf weltweiter Ebene. Diese sollten insbesondere darauf ausgerichtet sein, erstens die Transparenz sowohl des staatlichen als auch des privaten Sektors zu erhöhen, zweitens die inländischen Bankensysteme, insbesondere in Schwellen- und Reformländern, zu stärken und drittens die Prävention und Bewältigung von Finanzkrisen vor allem durch eine größere Beteiligung des privaten Sektors zu verbessern. Zu diesen Themen wurde bereits eine Reihe von Vorschlägen gemacht, die nun endgültig ausgearbeitet werden sollten, damit sie frühzeitig und effektiv umgesetzt werden können.  Die jüngsten makroökonomischen Daten zeigen, daß der wirtschaftliche Aufschwung in der Euro-Zone, trotz Verschlechterung der Umfeldbedingungen, zwar etwas gebremst, insgesamt jedoch nicht unterbrochen wurde. Die Binnennachfrage ist weiterhin lebhaft, während der Wachstumsbeitrag der Nettoausfuhren zurückgegangen ist. In bezug auf die jüngsten Preisentwicklungen ist der am harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex (HICP) gemessene Preisanstieg im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet im August auf 1,2% gefallen, nachdem er von Mai bis Juli bei 1,4 % lag. Sowohl heimische als auch externe Faktoren erscheinen günstig für die künftige Preisentwicklung im Euro-Währungsgebiet. Ein wichtiger externer Faktor ist der starke Rückgang der Energiepreise, die im August fast 4 % unter ihrem Vorjahresniveau lagen, und anderer Rohstoffpreise wider. Ferner halten sich interne inflationsbegünstigende Faktoren im Zusammenhang mit der Arbeitsmarktlage und der Kapazitätsauslastung gegenwärtig ebenfalls in Grenzen. Auch die gegenwärtigen monetären und finanziellen Entwicklungen stehen im Einklang mit diesen positiven Aussichten für die Preisstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet.  Das Umfeld erheblicher Schwankungen und Korrekturen bei den internationalen Aktienkursen und den Wechselkursen der Krisenregionen scheint wesentlich zum jüngsten Rückgang der langfristigen Zinsen im Euro-Währungsgebiet auf historische Tiefstände beigetragen zu haben. Trotz eines leichten Anstiegs in jüngster Zeit, sind die Zinssätze für 10-jährige Anleihen in der Euro-Zone seit Dezember 1997 um etwa einen Prozentpunkt gesunken. Die Anleger waren offensichtlich bestrebt, sich gegen die erhöhten globalen Risiken abzusichern. Die Renditekurve im Euro-Währungsgebiet hat sich gegenüber der vor einigen Monaten herrschenden Situation abgeflacht, was bis zu einem gewissen Grad auf eine weitere Abschwächung der langfristigen Inflationserwartungen der Finanzmärkte für das Euro-Gebiet insgesamt hindeutet. Für die konjunkturelle Lage in der Euro-Zone sind die relativ niedrigen kurzfristigen Zinsen ebenfalls von wichtiger Bedeutung.  Gleichzeitig müssen wir aber die finanzpolitischen Vorhaben der Mitgliedstaaten des Euro-Währungsgebietes, die im Laufe des Herbstes besser zu überschauen sein werden, im Auge behalten. Wenn die Regierungen lediglich an den für 1999 gesteckten Zielvorgaben für das Defizit festhalten, würden sich die strukturellen Haushaltspositionen in einer Reihe von Ländern effektiv verschlechtern. Dies würde bedeuten, daß sie sich von den Anforderungen des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes, der einen nahezu ausgeglichenen oder einen überschuß ausweisenden Haushalt vorschreibt, weiter entfernen würden, statt sich ihnen anzunähern.  Mit dem Herannahen der dritten Stufe der Währungsunion werden wir weiterhin die wirtschaftlichen, monetären und finanziellen Entwicklungen des Euro-Währungsgebietes, einschließlich der Auswirkungen der weltwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung, genau beobachten und analysieren müssen. Auf dieser Grundlage werden wir dann den für den gesamten Euro-Raum geltenden Zinssatz festlegen. Dabei werden wir uns strikt an dem vom Vertrag vorgegebenen Ziel der Preisstabilität in der Euro-Zone als Ganzes orientieren. Angesichts bisweilen geäußerter Befürchtungen, daß der EZB-Rat zu Beginn der Währungsunion mit überhöhten Zinsen versuchen könnte, den Aufbau von Glaubwürdigkeit zu unterstützen, möchte ich noch einmal klar feststellen: Wir werden die Geldpolitik so ausrichten, daß Preisstabilität bestmöglich erhalten werden kann. Es gibt keinen Grund restriktiver zu sein, als es dieses Ziel erfordert. Nicht nur Inflation, auch Deflation ist unvereinbar mit Preisstabilität. Die Geldpolitik muß stets wachsam sein und die monetäre und wirtschaftliche Lage vorausschauend beurteilen um rechtzeitig auf relevante neue Entwicklungen reagieren zu können. Falls sich zukünftige Abweichungen von der Preisstabilität im Euro-Raum abzeichnen sollten, wird die Geldpolitik nicht zögern präventiv zu handeln. Ich möchte in diesem Zusammenhang darauf hinweisen, daß die gegenwärtige Konvergenz der Zinsen innerhalb Europas bereits eine Lockerung des geldpolitischen Kurses in der Euro-Zone mit sich bringt. Eine Reihe dem Euro-Währungsgebiet angehörender Zentralbanken hat kürzlich Zinssenkungen vorgenommen. Dieser Schritt wurde vom EZB-Rat sehr begrüßt. Die Anpassungen in verschiedenen Ländern bewegen sich damit alle in eine Richtung und tragen zu einer spürbaren Reduzierung des durchschnittlichen Zinsniveaus in Europa bei. Ein wichtige Weichenstellung am Weg zur Europäischen Währungsunion war die Errichtung der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) am 1. Juni dieses Jahres. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurden die Vorbereitungen für die einheitliche europäische Geldpolitik vom Europäischen Währungsinstitut vorangetrieben. Entscheidungen im Zusammenhang mit den geldpolitischen Vorbereitungen konnten jedoch gemäß Maastricht-Vertrag und dem dort verankerten Statut der Europäischen Zentralbank nur vom EZB-Rat selbst getroffen werden. Dieser hat seit der Aufnahme seiner Geschäftstätigkeit zahlreiche wichtige Entscheidungen gefällt. Lassen Sie mich einige dieser Beschlüsse etwas näher erläutern. Wie Sie heute vielleicht schon den Pressemeldungen entnehmen konnten, hat der EZB-Rat gestern besonders wichtige Entscheidungen getroffen. Wir haben die Hauptelemente einer stabilitätsorientierten geldpolitischen Strategie für das ESZB festgelegt.  Diese Elemente betreffen:     die quantitative Festlegung des vorrangigen Ziels der einheitlichen Geldpolitik, der Preisstabilität    eine herausragende Rolle der Geldmenge mit einem Referenzwert für das Wachstum eines monetären Aggregates und    eine auf breiter Grundlage erfolgende Beurteilung der Aussichten für die künftige Preisentwicklung.      Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, wie im Maastricht Vertrag vorgeschrieben, wird die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität selbstverständlich das vorrangige Ziel des ESZB sein. Die geldpolitische Strategie des ESZB wird sich strikt an diesem Ziel ausrichten. Der EZB-Rat definiert Preisstabilität als Anstieg des Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex (HVPI) für das Euro-Währungsgebiet von unter 2% gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Preisstabilität muß mittelfristig beibehalten werden.  Die derzeitige Preissteigerungsrate gemessen am HVPI im Euro-Währungsgebiet steht im Einklang mit diesem Ziel. In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich hervorheben, daß der EZB-Rat mir den Worten \"für das ganze Währungsgebiet\" bewußt eine eindeutige Ausrichtung seiner Politik auf den gesamten Euro-Raum signalisiert. Daraus ist klar ersichtlich, daß der EZB-Rat seine Entscheidungen auf die monetäre, wirtschaftliche und finanzielle Entwicklung im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet stützen wird und die einheitliche Geldpolitik nicht auf bestimmte regionale oder nationale Entwicklungen reagieren wird. Die Betonung auf die mittelfristige Perspektive dieser Zieldefinition spiegelt wider, daß die Geldpolitik eine vorausschauende, mittelfristige Orientierung haben muß. Auch kurzfristige Preisschwankungen, die von der Geldpolitik nicht gesteuert werden können, kann und muß die EZB nicht reagieren.  Um dieses vorrangige Ziel der Beibehaltung der Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten, hat sich der EZB-Rat auf eine geldpolitische Strategie verständigt, die aus zwei Hauptelementen bestehen wird.     Die Geldmenge wird eine herausragende Rolle spielen. Diese Rolle wird in der Ankündigung eines quantitativen Referenzwertes für das Wachstum eines breiten monetären Aggregates zum Ausdruck kommen. Dieser Referenzwert wird in einer Weise abgeleitet, die mit dem Ziel der Preisstabilität vereinbar ist und der Erreichung dieses Ziels dient.    Abweichungen des aktuellen monetären Wachstums vom Referenzwert würden - unter normalen Bedingungen - Risiken für die Preisstabilität anzeigen. Das Konzept eines Referenzwertes bedeutet jedoch keine Verpflichtung zu einer mechanistischen Korrektur von Abweichungen auf kurze Frist. Das Verhältnis zwischen tatsächlichem monetären Wachstum und dem vorab bekannt gegebenen Referenzwert wird vom EZB-Rat regelmäßig und sorgfältig analysiert; das Ergebnis dieser Analyse und seine Beduetung für die geldpolitischen Entscheidungen werden der öffentlichkeit erläutert. Die genaue Abgrenzung des Referenzaggregats und der konkrete quantitative Referenzwert für das Geldmengenwachstum werden im Dezember 1998 vom EZB-Rat bekannt gegeben.    Parallel zur Analyse des Geldmengenwachstums in Relation zum Referenzwert wird eine auf breiter Basis erfolgende Beurteilung der Aussichten für die Preisentwicklung und der Risiken für die Preisstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet in der Strategie des ESZB eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Für diese Beurteilung wird ein breites Spektrum wirtschaftlicher und finanzieller Größen als Indikatoren der künftigen Preisentwicklung herangezogen.      Diese Strategie, meine Damen und Herren, unterstreicht die strikte Ausrichtung des EZB-Rates an seinem vorrangigen Ziel und sollte die Erfüllung dieser übergeordneten Aufgabe erleichtern. Sie wird außerdem die Transparenz der Entscheidungfindung des ESZB und seine öffentliche Kontrolle gewährleisten. Gestützt auf seine Strategie wird der EZB-Rat die öffentlichkeit regelmäßig und ausführlich über seine Einschätzung der monetären, wirtschaftlichen und finanziellen Lage im Euro-Währungsgebiet sowie über die Gründe für seine konkreten Beschlüsse informieren.  Schon in der Septembersitzung des EZB-Rates einigte man sich über verschiedene Fragen, die den geldpolitischen Rahmen in der dritten Stufe betreffen. Den Mittelpunkt dieses Rahmens bildet der am 18. September 1998 veröffentlichte Bericht mit dem Titel \"Die einheitliche Geldpolitik in Stufe 3: Allgemeine Regelungen für die geldpolitischen Instrumente und Verfahren des ESZB\". Er enthält eine ausführliche Beschreibung der geldpolitischen Instrumente und Verfahren, die vom ESZB in der dritten Stufe angewandt werden. Er versorgt die Kreditinstitute mit der nötigen Information um sich für die Teilnahme an den geldpolitischen Operation zu Beginn 1999 vorzubereiten.  Der Bericht beschreibt und erläutert unter anderem     die Kriterien, die Kreditinstitute erfüllen müssen, um als Geschäftspartner bei den geldpolitischen Operationen des ESZB zugelassen zu werden;    die geldpolitischen Instrumente und Verfahren;    die Auswahlkriterien und die Maßnahmen zur Risikokontrolle für die als Sicherheiten zugelassenen Wertpapiere;    das Mindestreservesystem des ESZB und    die Anwendung der geldpolitischen Instumente und Verfahren des ESZB im übergang zu Stufe III.      In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich Ihnen kurz das dem ESZB zur Verfügung stehende Instrumentarium skizzieren. Das ESZB wird hauptsächlich mit Offenmarktinstrumenten in Form von befristeten Transaktionen, sogenannten Repos, agieren. Sie haben sich mittlerweile bei allen nationalen Zentralbanken als marktgerechtes und effektives Instrument durchgesetzt. Das Hauptgeschäft wird in wöchentlichem Abstand mit einer Laufzeit von jeweils zwei Wochen abgeschlossen werden.  Daneben wird das ESZB längerfristige Repos mit einer Laufzeit von drei Monaten anbieten. Um unerwarteten Liquiditäts- und damit auch Zinsschwankungen angemessen begegnen zu können, kann das ESZB auch auf ein breites Spektrum von Feinsteuerungsoperationen, wie etwa befristete Transaktionen oder Devisenswaps, zurückgreifen.  Zudem hat das ESZB zwei sogenannte \"ständige\" Fazilitäten zur Verfügung, deren Inanspruchnahme auf Initiative der Geschäftspartner erfolgt. Es wird eine Spitzenrefinanzierungsfazilität und eine Einlagenfazilität geben. Die Spitzenrefinanzierungsfazilität entspricht dabei weitgehend dem deutschen Lombard. Sie ist in erster Linie ein Sicherheitsventil bei kurzfristigen Liquiditätsengpässen im Bankensystem und begrenzt damit die Ausschläge der Geldmarktsätze nach oben. Gewissermaßen das Gegenstück ist die kurzfristige Einlagenfazilität, die kurzfristige Liquiditätsüberschüsse abfangen soll und die Untergrenze für die Geldmarktsätze bildet. Das geldpolitische Instrumentarium sieht weiterhin die Einführung einer europäischen Mindestreserve vor. Es war dem EZB-Rat bei seiner Entscheidung durchaus bewußt, daß dieses Instrument nicht von allen Marktteilnehmern gleichermaßen willkommen geheißen wird. In einigen Ländern war die Mindestreservepflicht in der Vergangenheit deutlich reduziert oder überhaupt abgeschafft worden.  Bei der Ausgestaltung des europäischen Mindestreservesystems wurde darauf geachtet, die geldpolitischen Funktionen der Mindestreserve zu nützen, gleichzeitig aber die potentielle Belastung für den privaten Sektor und die möglichen Auswirkungen auf die Wettbewerbssituation der Kreditinstitute in der Euro-Zone so gering als möglich zu halten.  Die Mindestreservepflicht ist für den Durchschnitt eines Monats definiert. Dies bedeutet, daß die Kreditinstitute kurzfristige Liquiditätsschwankungen über ihr Mindestreservekonto ausgleichen können, ohne den Geldmarkt in Anspruch nehmen zu müssen. Die Mindestreserve wird damit zur Vermeidung unnötiger Schwankungen der kurzfristigen Zinsen beitragen und die Häufigkeit von Feinsteuerungsmaßnahmen reduzieren.  Gestern hat der EZB-Rat die letzten Entscheidungen über die Ausgestaltung der Mindestreservesystems getroffen. Der Mindestreservesatz wird 2% betragen. Dieser Satz erscheint - zur Zeit - hoch genug, um Volatilitäten der Geldmarktsätze zu vermeiden und die Nachfrage nach Zentralbankgeld ausreichend zu erhöhen. Außerdem wird die Mindestreserve zu Beginn der Währungsunion voll, d.h. zum Reposatz des ESZB, verzinst.Ebenfalls gestern beschlossen wurde ein pauschaler Freibetrag von 100.000 Euro, der vom Mindestreservesoll eines Kreditinstitutes abgezogen wird. Daher werden viele sehr kleine Kreditinstitute keine Mindestreserve halten müssen. In Kürze wird eine EZB-Verordnung über Mindestreserven veröffentlicht werden, in der die Merkmale des ESZB-Mindestreservesystems in rechtsverbindlicher Weise dargelegt werden.  Weiterhin finden sich in den \"Allgemeinen Regelungen\" eine Liste ausgewählter Wertpapierabwicklungssysteme, die nach sorgfältiger Beurteilung als für die Kreditgeschäfte des ESZB geeignet erkannt wurden.  Auch in der Wechselkurspolitik gab es weitere Weichenstellungen. In seiner Septembersitzung genehmigte der erweiterte Rat der EZB den Text eines Abkommens zwischen EZB und den nicht dem Euro-Währungsgebiet angehörenden Zentralbanken. In diesem Abkommen wurde die Funktionsweise eines Wechselkursmechanismus in der dritten Stufe (der sogenannte WKM II) festgelegt. Im Juni vergangenen Jahres hat der Europäische Rat in Amsterdam die Errichtung eines solchen Wechselkursmechanismus beschlossen, der das bisherige Europäische Währungssystem (EWS) ablösen soll. Der WKM II soll sicherstellen, daß die vorerst nicht an der EWU teilnehmenden Staaten eine stabilitätsorientierte Politik betreiben. Darüberhinaus soll die Teilnahme am Wechselkursmechanismus den Konvergenzprozeß dieser Länder unterstützen und die zukünftige Einführung des Euro erleichtern. Dieses Abkommen wurde nun von mir als EZB-Präsident im Namen des EZB-Rates und den Präsidenten der vier nicht dem Euro-Währungsgebiet angehörenden nationalen Zentralbanken unterzeichnet. Mit ihrer Unterschrift bestätigen diese nationalen Zentralbanken ihr Einverständnis mit der Funktionsweise des WKM II, nicht jedoch ihre Teilnahme.  Wie Ihnen sicherlich bekannt ist, haben Dänemark und Griechenland am 26. September dieses Jahres ihre Teilnahme am WKM II bereits angekündigt. Der EZB-Rat hat diese Entscheidung willkommen geheißen. Auch wenn die genauen Teilnahmebedingungen erst festgelegt werden können, sobald die bilateralen Leitkurse feststehen, kam man überein, daß Dänemark mit einem engen Band von ± 2,25%, Griechenland mit einem Band von ± 15% teilnehmen werden. Bezüglich der Euro-Banknoten bestätigte der EZB-Rat (in Einklang mit vorhergegangenen Empfehlungen des EWI), daß sieben Banknotenstückelungen ausgegeben werden: von Euro 5 bis Euro 500. Ferner hat der Rat beschlossen, daß die Euro-Banknoten keine nationalen Merkmale aufweisen werden. Diese Entscheidung hat, wenn auch mit erheblicher Verzögerung, für ein bemerkenswertes Medienecho gesorgt; allerdings in erster Linie außerhalb der Euro-Zone.  Wie Sie wissen, werden die Euro-Banknoten am 1. Januar 2002 in Umlauf gegeben. Bis zu ihrer Einführung sind es also noch weniger als 800 Arbeitstage. Der EZB-Rat hat zur Kenntnis genommen, daß die technischen Vorbereitungen für die Euro-Banknoten plangemäß verlaufen. Die drucktechnische Umsetzung (d.h. das Verfahren zur Umwandlung der Entwürfe in Banknoten) wurde nunmehr erfolgreich abgeschlossen. Im Herbst wird eine Nullserienproduktion durchgeführt, bis Anfang 1999 dann die zur Produktion bestimmten Banknoten beginnt.  Bis zum 1. Januar 2002 werden in den 11 teilnehmenden Mitgliedsstaaten 13 Milliarden Euro-Banknoten gedruckt sein. Diese Schätzung, die wiederrum in Schätzungen für jedes einzelne Land unterteilt ist, wird jährlich aktualisiert. Die nationalen Zentralbanken werden nun auf der Grundlage dieser Schätzung ihre Druckaufträge erteilen.  Weitere Beschlüsse zu den Euro-Banknoten betreffen die Errichtung einer Falschgeldstelle zur Untersuchung gefälschter Euro-Banknoten durch die EZB. Die entsprechenden statistischen und technischen Daten werden in einer Datenbank gespeichert, die auch die entsprechenden daten zu gefälschten Euro-Münzen enthält. Der Inhalt dieser Datenbank wird allen nationalen Zentralbanken der EU-Staaten und den entsprechenden Strafverfolgungsbehörden, die in der Falschgeldbekämpfung tätig sind, zugänglich gemacht. Damit meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, komme ich zum Schluß meiner heutigen Ausführungen. Wir alle sehen, daß die künftige Währungsunion gerade dabei ist, ihre erste Belastungsprobe zu bestehen. Während wir in vielen Regionen der Welt krisenhafte Entwicklungen beobachten, hat sich die künftige Euro-Zone bisher als stabiler Pol erwiesen. Mehr noch als bisher wird für die öffentlichkeit die Bedeutung des Projektes Europäische Währungsunion sichtbar. Es muß uns allerdings klar sein, daß wir in Europa noch längst nicht alle notwendigen Aufgaben erledigt haben. Die eigentliche Bewährungsprobe beginnt erst. Sie erfordert weiterhin harte Arbeit, um die eingegangenen Stabilitätsverpflichtungen einzulösen und die Märkte anpassungsfähiger zu machen. Wir müssen Konvergenz und Stabilität dauerhaft sichern. Hierzu darf kein Land in Europa in seinen Anstrengungen nachlassen, sein eigenes Haus in Ordnung zu bringen, insbesondere nicht in der Haushaltspolitik und bei den Strukturreformen. Ich bin überzeugt, daß diese Verantwortung erkannt wurde und die Politik danach handeln wird. In bezug auf die Geldpolitik kann ich Ihnen auf jeden Fall versichern, daß der EZB-Rat alles in seiner Macht stehende tun wird, die EWU zu einem Erfolg werden zu lassen.   ']\n",

Introduction   On 1 January 1999, the curtain will rise on a world première. For the first time in history, sovereign states will abandon their own currencies in favour of a common currency, and transfer their monetary policy sovereignty to a newly created supranational institution. This process is all the more unusual from a historical perspective because the national currencies involved are not being abolished because of their weakness. On the contrary, proof of a large measure of monetary stability is demanded as a precondition for participation. The decision has been taken. The Euro will start on time. It must not - and it will not - fail. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will devote its best endeavours to making European Monetary Union (EMU) a success. The French president recently called this unique project a \"great collective adventure\". As a central banker I am generally not in favour of \"adventures\" - but who would deny that there are risks and uncertainties in this enterprise? You should be reassured that at the European Central Bank (ECB), we have the necessary independence, instruments and tools to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a successful way. I will discuss some of these in a moment. Moreover, when considering the uncertainties implied by the transition to Stage Three of EMU, we should not forget that Monetary Union will also reduce, or even eliminate, a number of risks. This has already been demonstrated, even before the actual introduction of the euro. Recent turmoil in international financial markets did not cause any significant disruption to exchange rates among currencies of the designated participants in Stage Three. This is a clear demonstration of the success of the EMU process. Today, I will address the role of monetary policy in EMU. First, I will make reference to the final goal of monetary policy - the maintenance of price stability. Second, I will discuss some important issues relating to the design and implementation of the monetary policy strategy at the outset of Stage Three of Monetary Union; and Finally, I will describe some features of the operational framework of the ESCB that have recently been finalised. Let me begin by discussing the over-riding priority we attach to the maintenance of price stability.   2. The priority of price stability   The Treaty on European Union - the Maastricht Treaty - stipulates that the \"primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". It was left to the ESCB to provide a quantitative definition of this primary objective. At the ECB\\'s precursor, the European Monetary Institute (EMI), it was agreed that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the ESCB\\'s chosen operational definition of price stability should be announced publicly. This announcement would form an important element of the overall monetary policy strategy. Simply defining price stability leaves open the question of why price stability is desirable. As a central banker, the benefits of price stability appear self-evident. Any single argument in favour of price stability cannot comprehensively describe the benefits that it brings. For instance, concerning the United States, Martin Feldstein has recently shown that, in combination with taxes and social contributions, even quite modest rates of inflation can cause considerable real economic losses. Research at the Bundesbank has produced similar results for Germany. But elimination of the losses caused by this channel is only one illustrative example among the many benefits of price stability. The greatest contribution that the ESCB can make to the euro area\\'s output and employment performance is to achieve and maintain the stability of prices. Stable prices are at the core of the \\'stability culture\\' we are trying to create in Europe, a culture that is the foundation of sustainable and strong growth in the standard of living for Europe\\'s citizens. At the same time, the ESCB does not operate in a vacuum. Monetary policy needs to be supported by an appropriate fiscal policy and necessary structural reforms implemented at the national level if this \\'stability culture\\' is to be built on solid and sustainable foundations. The private sector also has its part to play, notably by exercising wage moderation, given the high levels of structural unemployment in the euro area. Progress on all these dimensions is not only desirable, but also absolutely necessary. Monetary policy alone cannot ensure strong, non-inflationary growth and improved employment prospects throughout the euro area. However, only a monetary policy focussed closely on the achievement of price stability can lay the basis for these conditions. Of course, that is not to say that the ESCB can, or should, ignore broader macroeconomic considerations. For instance, the threats posed by deflation in combination with nominal rigidities to the real economy have to be taken into account. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, let me be very clear: my discussion of deflation has to be seen in the context of the formulation of an optimal definition of price stability for the ESCB that takes into account deflationary dangers. These dangers certainly cannot be ruled out and our definition of price stability should reflect them. However, simply recalling the current rate of inflation in the euro area - 1.2% - shows that deflation is not an immediate concern for policy-makers. While periodic and transitory falls in the price level may be normal, and should not give rise to major concerns, a prolonged deflation is clearly inconsistent with any meaningful definition of price stability. Moreover, since nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, a prolonged deflation may render the interest rate policy of the central bank rather ineffective. What remains is out-right purchases of assets - both foreign and domestic. Similarly, the ESCB cannot ignore the implications of nominal rigidities in wages and prices for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. If we were to live long enough under a regime of stable prices, I would not exclude the possibility that wage and price setting behaviour would adapt, and nominal rigidities would finally disappear. This would reduce some of the potential output costs of fighting inflation, and thus increase the net long-run benefits of price stability. However, for the time being we may have to live with these rigidities and take their effects into account when deciding on our monetary policy strategy. In this respect, the present situation is not easy for the ESCB. Unemployment in the euro area is currently very high. However, in contrast to these persistently high levels of unemployment - which are largely structural in origin - the prospects for maintaining price stability are currently very encouraging. Inflation expectations and long-term interest rates in the euro area are at close to historical lows. Actual area-wide inflation is also very subdued. The current low \\'headline\\' rate of inflation has been moderated somewhat by recent falls in oil and commodity prices, themselves stemming, in part, from the economic and financial crises in Asia and, more recently, in Russia. However, this effect on inflation has been largely off-set by the impact of indirect tax rises in a number of participating countries, which have raised consumer prices for certain goods. All in all, the changed external environment contributes to an overall outlook of very subdued inflationary pressures. In defining price stability, one might ideally refer to a conceptual measure of \\'core\\' inflation that tries to isolate monetary effects on the price level - for which the ESCB is properly responsible - from such terms of trade or indirect tax shocks, over which it has little immediate control. In our month-to-month communication with the public, \\'core\\' measures of inflation may prove useful. But, in its preparatory work for Monetary Union, the EMI recognised that any sensible definition of price stability for the euro area would have to be based on a comprehensive and harmonised price measure. \\'Core\\' measures of inflation typically exclude some items. They are unlikely to be comprehensive enough to satisfy the requirements of an index suitable for a sensible public definition. These considerations point to using the \\'headline\\' measure of the harmonised index of consumer prices (or HICP) for the euro area in the definition of price stability. Finally, the ESCB needs to build on the success of its constituent national central banks (NCBs) in reducing inflation and achieving price stability during the convergence process in Stage Two of EMU. Given the current generally benign inflation outlook in the euro area that is the product of these accomplishments, there is an understandable desire to \\'lock-in\\' the current success in achieving price stability as well as the apparent credibility of monetary policy, and ensure continuity with existing central bank practice.    3. The importance of the monetary strategy for a successful start of European monetary policy   When price stability is defined using the principles just outlined, how should the ESCB proceed to maintain it? In achieving and maintaining price stability - the primary objective of the Treaty - the choice of monetary policy strategy is vital. Within the ECB, a considerable amount of work on the monetary policy strategy has already been completed, building to a large extent on the substantial earlier preparatory work of the EMI. A high degree of consensus has been reached among the NCBs and within the ECB about the main outlines of the strategy - I will address some of these areas of agreement in a moment. The final decision has not yet been made. But you should be reassured that progress is being made at a good pace. I have no doubt that we will be in a position to announce the details of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy in good time, prior to the start of Stage Three. Being a new institution, the European Central bank must be prepared to come under intense scrutiny right from the start. In particular, the international financial markets will monitor its every decision like hawks. Facing this environment in the run-up to Monetary Union, the ESCB must ensure that everything possible is done to make the launch of Stage Three as tension-free as is possible. Choosing and announcing an appropriate monetary strategy is crucial. The monetary policy strategy is, in the first place, important for the internal decision-making process of the ESCB - how the Governing Council will decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance, given the economic environment. Above all, the ESCB strategy must lead to good - that is to say, timely and forward-looking - monetary policy decisions. But the strategy is also of the utmost significance in communicating with audiences outside the ESCB. It should stabilise inflation expectations. The more the strategy helps to promote credibility and confidence in the ESCB\\'s monetary policy at the outset of EMU, the more effective that policy will be - and the easier the ESCB\\'s task of maintaining price stability will become. In deciding upon the appropriate monetary policy strategy, the following aspects must be seen as essential requirements. The strategy must:     reinforce the ESCB\\'s commitment to price stability, the primary and over-riding task stipulated by the Treaty;    it must clearly signal the anti-inflationary objectives of the ESCB, and serve as a consistent benchmark for the monetary policy stance; and,    it must be transparent and explained clearly to the general public - only then can the strategy serve as a basis for the ESCB\\'s accountability to the public at large.      The realisation that achievement of an optimal, non-inflationary macroeconomic outcome may founder on the private sector\\'s distrust has been central to the monetary policy debate of the nineteen-eighties and \\'nineties. The search for answers to the questions raised by this debate has spawned an enormous economic literature. The keywords \"time inconsistency\" and \"credibility\" draw forth an almost unmanageable flood of publications that have appeared in the wake of the pioneering contributions of Kydland / Prescott and Barro / Gordon. The need to establish a credible and consistent monetary strategy in the face of the well-known time inconsistency problem faced by policy makers - the dilemma highlighted by this economic literature - is especially important for the ESCB at the outset of Monetary Union. As a brand new institution, the ESCB will have no track record of its own. Building its reputation, and the associated credibility of monetary policy, is vital. But the process of doing so is complicated by the relatively high level of uncertainty surrounding the transition to Monetary Union itself. The transition to Stage Three is a unique event, and will create unique opportunities for many - but it will also create some unique problems for monetary policy makers. At the ECB, we are addressing these problems and are confident that the risks can be managed successfully. Many of the difficulties we face will be overcome through our own efforts over the coming months. Among these problems are the difficulties involved in creating a comprehensive and accurate database of euro area-wide statistics. Running a single monetary policy for the euro area requires timely, reliable and accurate euro area data. In some cases, the euro area statistics simply did not exist until quite recently. In others, the statistics are based on new concepts, and the properties of the data series are not yet well known. The long runs of high quality back-data required for empirical economic analysis may be unavailable. Those that do exist are likely to have been constructed using some degree of estimation and judgement, possibly rendering the econometric results produced with them questionable. Furthermore, the regime shift associated with the adoption of the single monetary policy may change the way expectations are formed in the euro area, and thereby alter forward-looking economic behaviour. Monetary policy\\'s effects on consumption, investment, and wage bargaining - and therefore the whole transmission mechanism of monetary policy to developments in the price level - would be among the important economic relationships to be affected in this way. This may be no bad thing. Indeed, using the regime shift implied by the transition to Stage Three to change both public and private sector behaviour in favourable directions may be one of the largest gains that the euro area can extract from Monetary Union. Nevertheless, these changes are likely to complicate the implementation of certain important elements of a monetary strategy, at least in the short term, as past relationships between macroeconomic variables may break down. What is good for the euro area economy as a whole may create some practical problems for the ESCB. One example of this so-called \\'Lucas critique\\' phenomenon is the impact of current, very low rates of inflation on private behaviour. For many countries participating in Monetary Union, there is simply no - or only very recent - experience of how the private sector will behave in an environment of sustained and credible low inflation. Instability in past relationships may result, should behaviour change in this new, low inflation environment. I have already argued that these structural changes will benefit Europe\\'s citizens - price stability will allow markets to work more efficiently, thereby raising growth, and improving employment prospects. But these changes may also complicate the ESCB\\'s assessment of economic and financial conditions. These uncertainties - arising directly from the transition to Stage Three itself - are both compounded by, and inter-related with, the broader economic context in which Monetary Union will be established. The increasing internationalisation of the global economy, and the current rapid pace of technological change, have affected all sectors of the economy, and the banking and financial systems in particular. For example, at present there are many, inter-related innovations in the payments system, such as:     the introduction of TARGET (directly related to EMU itself);    greater technological sophistication of payments mechanisms, as use of computers and information technology becomes more widespread and advanced;    the additional incentive for cash-less payments that may arise from the fact that for some time to come - approximately three years - the new euro-denominated notes and coin will not come into circulation. In particular, narrow monetary aggregates might be affected by this development; and,    increased competition among banks and settlements systems, arising from globalisation and the breakdown of barriers between previously segmented national markets, which may drive down the margins and fees charged to customers.      At the ESCB we will need to keep abreast of these developments, both for their immediate impact on one of our \"basic tasks\" - promoting the smooth operation of the payments system - and because of their broader implications for the euro area economy. Reducing transactions costs in the way I just described will benefit European consumers and producers - but it may also change the indicator properties of monetary, financial and economic variables that national central banks have looked to as guides for monetary policy in the past. Finally, in Monetary Union there will be some heterogeneity across countries within the euro area. Europe\\'s diversity is one of its greatest assets. But this diversity is greater than is typically the case between different regions in the same country using a single currency. Nevertheless, the ECB Governing Council will have to concentrate on monetary and economic developments in the euro area as a whole when discussing and taking monetary policy decisions. How should a monetary policy strategy be selected in this - for monetary policy makers, at least - potentially difficult environment? The EMI outlined a number of \\'guiding principles\\' for the selection of a monetary strategy by the ESCB. Foremost amongst these was the principle of \\'effectiveness\\'. The best monetary policy strategy for the ESCB is the one which best signals a credible and realistic commitment to, and ensures achievement of, the primary objective of price stability. For many commentators, this criterion points unambiguously in the direction of so-called \\'direct inflation targeting\\'. If monetary strategies are to be judged according to how well they achieve price stability, defined as a low rate of measured inflation, then advocates of inflation targets argue an optimal strategy would surely target this low inflation rate directly. These commentators would place explicit quantitative targets for inflation itself at the centre of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy strategy. Their approach has been strongly endorsed in some academic and central banking circles. But, in the current circumstances, a pure \\'direct inflation targeting\\' strategy is too simplistic for the ESCB, and possibly even mis-conceived. The ESCB well understands the primacy of price developments and price stability for monetary policy making. Indeed, the Treaty\\'s mandate is unambiguous in this respect. We will signal our intentions on this dimension very clearly by making a transparent public announcement of our definition of price stability. The current low level of long-term nominal interest rates in the euro area suggests that the financial markets, at least, understand and believe the over-riding priority that we attach to achieving price stability. Regarding strategy, our choice therefore need not be governed solely by a desire to signal our intent to maintain price stability. This has already been well-established - by the Treaty, and by the success of the convergence process in reducing inflation in Europe to its current low level. Rather than signalling our intent, the strategy must constitute a practical guide that ensures monetary policy is effective in achieving the goal we have been set. In this respect, there are considerable problems with using inflation itself as the direct target within the ESCB\\'s overall strategy. Because of the well-known lags in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy in general, and the price level in particular, it is impossible for a central bank to control inflation directly. Therefore, \\'inflation targeting\\' in practice means \\'inflation forecast targeting\\' where central banks set monetary policy to keep their best forecast of inflation at the target level deemed consistent with price stability. But recognition of this need for forecasts in an inflation targeting strategy immediately raises practical difficulties. In the uncertain environment likely to exist at the outset of Monetary Union, forecasting inflation will be very difficult, not least for the conceptual, empirical and practical reasons I outlined a moment ago. Forecasting models estimated using historic data may not offer a reliable guide to the behaviour of the euro area economy under Monetary Union. Forecast uncertainty is likely to be relatively large, possibly rendering the whole inflation targeting strategy ineffective. To address these uncertainties, a large element of judgement would have to be introduced into the forecasting process, in order to allow for the regime shifts and structural and institutional changes that are a seemingly inevitable consequence of EMU. Simply relying on historic relationships to forecast future developments is unlikely to prove accurate or effective. While introducing judgmental adjustments into forecasts in these circumstances would be both appropriate and necessary, such adjustments are likely to compromise the transparency of the inflation forecasts and, thus, of any inflation targeting strategy. Using judgement may prevent outside observers from readily assessing the reliability and robustness of the inflation forecasting procedures used by the ESCB. I see a distinct bias in the academic discussion of the comparative advantages of inflation targeting and monetary targeting. With good reason, many arguments are presented against the ESCB adopting a monetary target. But proponents of inflation targeting seem to forget that, in the current context, most of these arguments could also be used against inflation targeting. Above all, I have not seen any attempt thus far - even if only a tentative one - to explain how the ESCB should deal with the specific difficulties involved in making an inflation forecast at the outset of Monetary Union that could be used as the centrepiece of an inflation targeting strategy. In many respects, a strategy giving a prominent role to monetary aggregates has considerable advantages over direct inflation targeting. Monetary aggregates are published. They are clearly not subject to various kinds of \\'judgmental manipulation\\' by policy makers or central bank staff that might be possible with inflation forecasts. To the extent that policy makers wish to depart from the signals offered by monetary growth because of \\'special factors\\' or \\'distortions\\' to the data - including those distortions arising from the transition to Monetary Union itself - they will have to do so in a public, clear and transparent manner. Moreover, a strategy that assigns a prominent role to the monetary aggregates emphasises the responsibility of the ESCB for the monetary impulses to inflation, which a central bank can control more readily than inflation itself. These monetary impulses are the most important determinants of inflation in the medium term, while various other factors, such as terms of trade or indirect tax shocks, may influence the price level over shorter horizons. In the light of these considerations, it was agreed at the EMI that, regardless of the final choice of the monetary policy strategy, monetary aggregates would be accorded a prominent role in the overall monetary framework adopted by the ESCB. However, the EMI also noted that certain technical pre-conditions would have to be met before this \\'prominent role\\' could be translated into an explicit, publicly announced monetary target, guideline, benchmark or monitoring range. Specifically, such targets or ranges would only be meaningful guides to monetary policy if the relationship between money and prices - as encapsulated in a \\'demand for money\\' equation - was expected to remain sufficiently stable. In this regard, several existing empirical studies point towards the stability of the demand for euro area-wide monetary aggregates. However, these studies are necessarily only preliminary. The reliability of these results in the face of the uncertainties raised by the transition to Stage Three is unknown. Future shifts in the velocity of money are certainly possible - perhaps even likely. They cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, it is not clear whether those aggregates that have the best results in terms of stability are sufficiently controllable in the short-term with the policy instruments available to the ESCB. In these circumstances, relying on a pure strategy of strict monetary targeting is simply too risky. Against this background, the ESCB will have to design a monetary policy strategy of its own. The chosen strategy will show as much as possible continuity with the successful strategies that participating NCBs conducted in the Stage Two. At the same time the ESCB\\'s strategy will take into account to the extent needed the unique situation created by the introduction of the euro.    4. The new monetary policy instruments and procedures for the euro area   Having a well-designed monetary strategy is vital. But we must also be able to implement it successfully at an operational level. What instruments are available to implement this strategy? The ECB will have a complete set of monetary policy instruments at its disposal. These instruments have been selected on the basis of their efficiency for transmitting monetary policy and their neutrality across market participants. Three types of instruments are available to the ESCB: open market operations, standing facilities and a minimum reserve system. I will briefly present these instruments in the remainder of my speech.   4.1 Open market operations   Open market operations include, first, a weekly main refinancing operation, which will take the form of a reverse repurchase transaction with a maturity of two weeks. The main refinancing operation will be based on a tender procedure. The tender may be a fixed rate tender, with counterparties bidding amounts, or a floating rate tender, where counterparties propose bids including both amounts and interest rates. Second, there is the monthly longer term refinancing operation, which has a maturity of three months and will always take the form of an interest rate tender. This is because the ECB will avoid signalling its monetary policy stance through these particular operations. The ECB will also conduct fine-tuning operations, through the national central banks of the euro area or, in exceptional circumstances, on its own account. Fine tuning operations will be conducted whenever liquidity or money market conditions warrant. Fine tuning operations may take the form of reverse repurchase transactions (that is, the same type of transaction as that used in the main refinancing and the longer term refinancing operations, but with no pre-set start date nor a pre-set maturity), foreign exchange swaps or the taking of fixed-term deposits. Fine tuning operations in the form of reverse repurchase operations may be executed either through quick tenders or bilaterally. In both cases, these operations will involve a limited set of eligible counterparties that have an appropriate track record of activity in the money market. The other types of fine tuning operations will also be executed with a limited number of eligible counterparties, which will be selected ex ante by the ECB. In some countries, there will be a rotation scheme, which will aim at giving the opportunity to all eligible fine tuning counterparties to participate in fine tuning operations. Finally, open market operations may also be conducted whenever structural reasons, such as the longer-term evolution of liquidity profiles, warrant it. These so-called structural operations may take the form of outright purchases or sales of securities or the issuance of debt certificates by the ECB.   4.2 Standing facilities   The ECB will operate two overnight standing facilities, which will be available to all credit institutions at national central banks of the euro area, provided that, when using the marginal lending facility, they have sufficient collateral. The rate of the marginal lending facility will constitute the upper bound of collateralised overnight money market rates. The deposit facility will be remunerated at a rate that will constitute the lower bound of overnight money market rates. When using the marginal lending facility, or, for that matter, when entering in liquidity-providing open market operations in the form of reverse transactions, counterparties have to post assets with their national central bank (or the ECB in the exceptional case when the ECB conducts fine tuning operations on its own account). These assets are meant to act as guarantees for credits received from the European System of Central Banks. A list of eligible assets has been drawn up for this purpose. The list comprises a wide variety of assets and has two sub-sets. First, the so-called tier one assets, which are selected by the ECB according to uniform criteria relating to their credit standing in the whole euro area. Second, the so-called tier two assets, which have been selected by the ECB because they are of particular importance for certain national banking systems of the euro area, in order to promote a certain degree of continuity at the start of the Stage Three of EMU. Two principles of equal treatment are applied, however. First, the credit standing of tier two assets is as high as that of tier one assets. Second, both tier one and tier two assets may be used by any credit institution in the euro area, irrespective of its location. In addition, a set of risk control measures has been elaborated to ensure that, for any counterparty, the amount of assets provided is always sufficient. Risk control measures cover the assets\\' price and credit risks, taking account of the asset type, its characteristics and the maturity of the transaction. The ECB\\'s risk control measures have been elaborated with careful attention to the best market practices in this area. They include the deduction of haircuts from the assets and the imposition of initial margins to the credit amount. Another feature of the risk control framework is the regular revaluations of the assets, which will, in most cases, take place daily and may trigger margin calls, most often to be settled through delivery of additional assets.   4.3 Minimum reserve system   The ECB will also apply a minimum reserve system to credit institutions of the euro area. Two main monetary policy objectives have been assigned to the minimum reserve system. The first objective is to stabilise money market interest rates through the averaging mechanism, whereby the fulfilment of minimum reserve requirements is based on average reserve holdings over monthly periods of time. During the maintenance period, this allows the banking system to absorb liquidity shocks. The reduced volatility of money market rates will reduce the need for frequent fine tuning operations, which will mean that markets are less distorted by central bank interventions than they would otherwise be. The second objective of the minimum reserve system is to enlarge the demand for central bank money, so as to enlarge the liquidity deficit of the banking system vis-à-vis the ESCB. This will safeguard the role of the European System of Central Banks as a provider of liquidity to the banking system. Reserve requirements will be calculated by applying a reserve ratio of 1.5% to 2.5% to the deposits, debt securities and money market paper issued by credit institutions, except for residual maturities above two years. Although repurchase agreements are included in the reserve base, they will be subject to a zero reserve ratio. Inter-bank liabilities and liabilities vis-à-vis the ESCB will not be subject to reserve requirements. An allowance of the order of E 100,000 will be deducted from reserve requirements, so that credit institutions with a small reserve base will not have to hold minimum reserves. Reserve holdings will be remunerated up to the required reserve level, at the rate of the main refinancing operation (as averaged over a month). It may be argued that a less than full remuneration of minimum reserves would increase the interest rate elasticity of central bank money demand. This notwithstanding, the ECB has decided in favour of a full remuneration of minimum reserves in view of the distortion to efficient markets that a less than full remuneration would have implied. As a result of the full remuneration of minimum reserves, the European Central Bank has also decided not to exempt any credit institution from the minimum reserve system.   4.4 Procedures   The ECB will have many counterparties and be subject to close public scrutiny. It has therefore set up procedures for informing its counterparties and the public about its monetary policy instruments in a robust and transparent manner. The ECB will inform its counterparties and the public through a document detailing its monetary policy instruments and procedures and through the regular publication of various materials on its Internet site.  General Documentation  The ECB has produced a document describing its monetary policy instruments and procedures in detail. This is called \"General Documentation on ESCB Monetary Policy Instruments and Procedures\". A revised version of this document was published recently. This revised version includes all the newly specified elements of the monetary policy framework of the ECB, including for instance the minimum reserve system. This document also includes a calendar for the standard tender operations in 1999 (both main refinancing and longer term refinancing operations). Calendars of standard tender operations will be published by the ECB every year.  Publications on the ECB\\'s Internet site  The list of assets that are eligible as guarantees for liquidity providing operations will be made public on the Internet site of the ECB. The list will be updated on a weekly basis and users will be able to subscribe to an e-mailing facility for receiving certain designated parts of the list on a regular basis. Users will also be able to query the list, which will contain a large number of assets. The list of institutions subject to minimum reserves, that is, credit institutions established in the euro area, will also be available on the Internet site of the ECB, together with the list of all monetary and financial institutions in the European Union.   5. Concluding remarks   We are less than three months away from the moment when monetary policy sovereignty is transferred from the NCBs to the ESCB. The bulk of the preparatory work has already been completed, but major decisions - above all, the choice of a monetary policy strategy - still have to be made. The public can be certain that we will always inform them, regularly and comprehensively, about our considerations and deliberations. We will make all our decisions transparent. I have no doubt that we will be well prepared for the moment at which we take over responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area.  ']\n",

Le 1er janvier 1999, l’euro deviendra la monnaie unique des onze pays initialement participants. Pour l’Europe et pour le reste du monde, le projet de monnaie unique revêt une importance capitale. L’euro est l’occasion d’instaurer vraiment et durablement en Europe l’objectif de stabilité des prix, qui est à la source d’un développement économique fort et équilibré. Les personnels de la Banque centrale européenne et des banques centrales nationales de l’Union européenne sont fiers d’œuvrer en ce but. Je suis également fier de pouvoir participer à cette entreprise extraordinaire. J’aimerais essayer de vous faire partager l’enthousiasme des banquiers centraux en abordant le thème de la culture de la stabilité et en vous parlant des objectifs et des responsabilités du Système européen de Banques centrales. Je voudrais aussi décrire brièvement les instruments de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne et vous informer sur les travaux actuels de mise au point de la stratégie de politique monétaire.      La Banque centrale européenne va contribuer au développement d’une culture de la stabilité, qui doit aussi être le déterminant principal des politiques fiscales et de change.    La Banque centrale européenne va contribuer au développement d’une culture de la stabilité? Des institutions européennes et nationales préparent la monnaie unique depuis plusieurs années. Parmi elles, l’Institut monétaire européen, qui a cédé la place à la Banque centrale européenne le 1er juin, et les banques centrales nationales, occupent bien sûr une place très importante. Le Traité de Maastricht assigne à la Banque centrale européenne l’objectif de préserver la stabilité des prix dans l’ensemble des pays participants. Une politique monétaire claire, bien informée et inspirant la confiance du public est seule à même de garantir la stabilité des prix et, par là, de la valeur de l’argent. Je vais revenir sur ces éléments tout à l’heure. L’objectif de stabilité des prix est la condition nécessaire à un développement économique fort et équilibré. J’aimerais simplement citer deux grandes raisons. Il y a d’abord le meilleur contenu en information des prix. Les prix, lorsqu’ils sont stables, peuvent mieux renseigner les agents économiques sur la qualité des produits, des biens ou des services, ce qui permet d’améliorer la pertinence des prises de décision et donc l’allocation optimale des ressources. Ensuite, il y a le fait que la réduction de l’incertitude sur les évolutions futures des prix rend les prévisions d’avenir plus fines. Cela permet sans doute à des projets de moyen ou long terme d’être mieux évalués et, par conséquent, financés d’autant plus que la stabilité des prix favorise le maintien des taux d’intérêt à long terme à un niveau modéré. Au total, la stabilité des prix favorise donc l’investissement et l’emploi. J’ajoute que la stabilité des prix est aussi un facteur essentiel de cohésion sociale. Car l’inflation conduit à des redistributions de richesses qui ne sont pas décidées démocratiquement, et qui pénalisent toujours les catégories les plus fragiles de la population. Les systèmes bancaires et les marchés financiers des pays participants doivent également être solides et stables pour assurer convenablement le financement des économies et pour permettre une transmission efficace et rapide de la politique monétaire. Les règles de conduite dans ce domaine sont maintenant largement harmonisées au niveau de l’Union européenne, sur la base notamment de directives européennes. La Banque centrale européenne, et avant elle l’Institut monétaire européen, ont favorisé les initiatives des divers intervenants au regard de l’harmonisation de diverses conventions et pratiques des marchés financiers. En accord avec les statuts du Système européen de Banques centrales, la Banque centrale européenne et les banques centrales nationales veilleront à ce que les évolutions et les changements structurels s’effectuent de manière ordonnée, tout particulièrement au début de la troisième phase de l’Union économique et monétaire.    Cette culture de la stabilité doit aussi être le déterminant principal des politiques fiscales, économiques et de change    Les économies de la zone euro ne pourront toutefois s’épanouïr pleinement que si, en dehors de la stabilité des prix, plusieurs autres conditions nécessaires sont remplies. Ces conditions touchent à trois domaines: les politiques budgétaires, les politiques économiques et la politique de change. Les politiques budgétaires doivent viser à diminuer le poids des dettes publiques et à réduire ou annuler les déficits publics. A ce titre, le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance, sur lequel le Conseil européen d’Amsterdam s’est entendu en juin 1997, a permis de préciser les dispositions du Traité de Maastricht. Le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance constitue ainsi un engagement précis des gouvernements des pays de l’Union européenne, en faveur des objectifs de diminution des dettes publiques et de réduction des déficits publics. Bien entendu, le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance ne remet cependant pas en question le rôle stabilisateur que les finances publiques peuvent avoir lors des retournements de conjoncture.  Les autres volets des politiques économiques doivent quant à elles favoriser certains éléments ou être neutres par rapport à eux. Je citerai deux de ces éléments parmi les plus importants pour favoriser une croissance durable et équilibrée. D’une part, les marchés des biens et du travail doivent demeurer ou devenir suffisamment flexibles. D’autre part, les politiques salariales doivent rester modérées, c’est-à-dire tenir pleinement compte de la réalisation de l’objectif de stabilité des prix. J’en viens finalement à la politique de change de l’euro. Selon le Traité de Maastricht, le Conseil des Ministres de l’Union européenne peut, sur recommandation de la Banque centrale européenne, ou sur recommandation de la Commission européenne et après consultation de la Banque centrale européenne, décider d’instaurer une politique de change vis à vis de certaines devises, à condition qu’une telle politique ne porte pas préjudice à l’objectif de stabilité des prix. Le Conseil européen de Luxembourg a confirmé, en décembre dernier, qu’une telle politique de change ne serait mise en œuvre que de manière exceptionnelle et en cas de désalignement manifeste des parités.      Les objectifs de la Banque centrale européenne sont clairement définis et son indépendance précisément garantie. Pour être la plus efficace possible, la Banque centrale européenne se doit d’être transparente et responsable.     Les objectifs de la Banque centrale européenne sont clairement définis et son indépendance précisément garantie  L’objectif premier de la Banque centrale européenne est d’assurer la stabilité des prix. Comme je l’ai déjà indiqué, cet objectif est énoncé dans le Traité de Maastricht et a donc une importance éminente. La Banque centrale européenne s’est engagée à rendre publique une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix en tant qu’objectif, ce qui sera fait sous peu. L’indépendance, non seulement de la Banque centrale européenne mais aussi de chacune des banques centrales nationales, est garantie par le Traité de Maastricht. Le Conseil des gouverneurs de la Banque centrale européenne comprend le président, le vice-président et les quatre autres membres du directoire de la BCE ainsi que les gouverneurs des banques centrales nationales des pays participants, soit 17 personnes. Les membres du Conseil des gouverneurs ne peuvent recevoir ni solliciter d’avis des gouvernements nationaux, d’institutions nationales, de la Commission européenne ou d’autres institutions européennes.    \\x85 Pour être la plus efficace possible, la Banque centrale européenne se doit d’être transparente et responsable    L’indépendance requiert de la Banque centrale européenne des devoirs importants, en termes de transparence et de ce qu’on appelle en anglais \"democratic accountability\". Certains de ces devoirs sont énoncés dans le Traité de Maastricht. Le Traité stipule ainsi que la Banque centrale européenne doit publier un rapport trimestriel sur les activités du Système européen de Banques centrales. La Banque centrale européenne a indiqué qu’elle publierait également un bulletin mensuel. Le Traité de Maastricht indique également que la Banque centrale européenne doit communiquer un rapport annuel au Parlement européen, à la Commission européenne, au Conseil des ministres et au Conseil européen. Ce rapport doit décrire la politique monétaire conduite au cours de l’année écoulée et la stratégie adoptée ainsi que les orientations retenues pour l’année en cours. Le Traité prévoit que le Parlement européen organise un débat sur ce rapport et que le président ainsi que les membres du directoire de la Banque centrale européenne répondent aux questions des parlementaires. Le Président de la Banque centrale européenne a quant à lui indiqué qu’il accepterait de se rendre au Parlement européen, sur l’invitation de celui-ci, tous les trois mois. Ces comparutions se rajouteront à la présentation du rapport annuel. Par ailleurs, la Banque centrale européenne informera le public en détail sur sa stratégie, les raisons de ses décisions de politique monétaire, ainsi que ses analyses de la conjoncture et des évolutions économiques, monétaires et financières. Cette information sera mise à disposition lors de conférences de presse, d’interventions diverses ou dans le cadre de publications. Je tiens d’ailleurs à vous engager à rendre visite au site internet de la Banque centrale européenne, où vous pouvez trouver divers documents de référence publiés par la BCE, les communications de la BCE à la presse, les retranscriptions d’un certain nombre de discours et bien d’autres choses encore. Les décisions de politique monétaire seront présentées au public et expliquées au cours de conférences de presse ou de communiqués donnés à l’issue des réunions du Conseil des gouverneurs. En revanche, les minutes des délibérations et les votes des membres du Conseil des gouverneurs ne seront pas rendus publics. Certaines critiques ont été exprimées à ce sujet parce que les banques centrales de certains pays, dont la Banque d’Angleterre, rendent publics ce type d’éléments. Il ne faut cependant pas se méprendre sur la décision de la Banque centrale européenne. Cette décision a été prise dans le souci de préserver l’indépendance d’esprit et la liberté de jugement des membres du Conseil des gouverneurs. Il faut en effet voir que les membres du Conseil des gouverneurs pourraient être amenés à exprimer leurs vues, lors des délibérations du Conseil des gouverneurs, de manière différente selon la connaissance que le public a de leurs interventions. En outre, les membres du Conseil des gouverneurs pourraient trouver difficile d’expliquer les raisons d’une décision de politique monétaire à des interlocuteurs connaissant la distribution des votes favorables et défavorables à cette décision. Au total, il me semble que la Banque centrale européenne a fait un choix très fort et clair en faveur de la transparence, en allant bien au-delà des dispositions contenues dans le Traité de Maastricht. Cette transparence, alliée à la pertinence de ses prises de décision et à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre, doit contribuer à la crédibilité de la politique monétaire menée par le Système européen de Banques centrales.      Les instruments de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne ont été choisis pour assurer un maximum d’efficacité. Les spécifications détaillées de la stratégie de politique monétaire seront bientôt annoncées.     Les instruments de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne ont été choisis pour assurer un maximum d’efficacité  Le cadre opérationnel de la politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne a été élaboré de façon à être très efficace pour transmettre la politique monétaire, tout en étant le plus neutre possible quant à ses effets possibles sur la structure et l’organisation des systèmes financiers de la zone euro. Ces éléments apparaissent clairement au vu des méthodes de mise en œuvre et des spécifications opérationnelles des trois types d’instruments de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne: opérations de marché, facilités permanentes et réserves obligatoires.   Opérations de marché   Je parlerai tout d’abord des opérations de marché. Les opérations de marché régulières du Système européen de Banques centrales prennent deux formes: l’opération principale de refinancement, hebdomadaire et d’une durée de deux semaines; l’opération de refinancement longue, mensuelle et d’une durée de trois mois. Ces opérations seront conduites, à compter du 4 janvier prochain, au moyen d’appels d’offres, auxquels pourront participer un très grand nombre de contreparties, c’est-à-dire les établissements de crédit de la zone euro. Ce processus sera donc à la fois efficace, ouvert et transparent. Certaines opérations de marché, que l’on qualifie d’opérations de réglage fin, pourront avoir lieu de manière exceptionnelle, mais peu fréquemment, pour une raison que je vais dire tout à l’heure. Ces opérations de réglage fin pourront pour partie être fondées sur des appels d’offres, avec un ensemble plus limité d’offreurs ayant un profil d’activité important et de qualité dans le marché monétaire. Dans certains des pays de la zone, un système de rotation pourra être mis en place afin de faire participer le plus grand nombre possible de contreparties à ce type d’opérations. Il me reste à relever, pour être complet, que certaines opérations de marché, dites structurelles, pourront être effectuées lorsque l’évolution sur longue période des profils de liquidité le rend nécessaire. Ces opérations seront très peu fréquentes.   Facilités permanentes   Le Système européen de Banques centrales mettra à disposition des établissements de crédit de la zone euro deux facilités permanentes pour des dépôts au jour le jour, d’une part, et d’autre part pour des prêts au jour le jour. Les taux d’intérêts sur ces instruments, qui ne seront appelés à varier que rarement, détermineront un intervalle entre les bornes duquel évoluera, en règle générale, le taux de marché interbancaire au jour le jour.   Actifs éligibles   Pour les opérations de marché dans lesquels les banques centrales nationales ou la Banque centrale européenne procurent un crédit à leurs contreparties ainsi que lors des utilisations de la facilité permanente de prêt au jour le jour, les contreparties devront apporter des actifs en garantie. Une liste d’actifs éligibles a été élaborée par la Banque centrale européenne à cet effet. Les actifs éligibles ont été sélectionnés sur la base de critères uniformes, notamment la qualité de signature, au niveau de l’ensemble de la zone euro. Cette uniformité des critères de sélection se vérifie aussi dans le cas de certains actifs spécifiques à certains systèmes bancaires nationaux. Les actifs éligibles pourront d’ailleurs être utilisés indifféremment par tout établissement de crédit de la zone euro, quelle que soit leur localisation. Certaines mesures de contrôles des risques, telles que quotités, ré-évaluations et appels de marge, seront appliquées aux actifs reçus en garantie. Ces mesures, également uniformes dans la zone euro, bien entendu, ont été développées en conformité avec les meilleures pratiques de marché observées dans ce domaine.   Réserves obligatoires   Le troisième type d’instrument de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne est le système de réserves obligatoires. Les établissements de crédit devront détenir des dépôts dans les banques centrales nationales de telle sorte qu’en moyenne au cours du mois, ces dépôts excèdent un montant de réserves obligatoires calculé en fonction d’un certain nombre d’éléments représentant les passifs monétaires de chaque établissement. Ce système a deux objectifs principaux: la stabilisation des taux du marché monétaire, d’une part, et d’autre part le maintien d’une demande suffisante de monnaie de banque centrale. Une demande suffisante de monnaie de banque centrale doit permettre de préserver le rôle du Système européen de Banques centrales comme principal pourvoyeur de liquidité des systèmes bancaires de la zone euro. L’idée que j’aimerais faire passer ici est celle de la neutralité du système de réserves obligatoires de la Banque centrale européenne. Le système est neutre parce que les réserves obligatoires sont entièrement rémunérées au taux moyen des opérations principales de refinancement. Les établissements de crédits n’encourent donc en moyenne aucun coût d’opportunité du fait de la détention de réserves obligatoires. Par ailleurs, le coefficient des réserves obligatoires sera relativement bas, puisqu’il a été annoncé qu’il serait fixé entre 1,5% et 2,5%. Enfin, une franchise d’environ 100.000 Euro sera appliquée au montant des réserves à détenir, ce qui permettra aux établissements les plus petits, pour lesquels les coûts fixes de ce système, bien que limités, peuvent être gênants, de ne pas avoir à constituer de réserves. Dans le même temps, la franchise ne sera pas inégalitaire puisqu’elle s’appliquera uniformément à tous les établissements. Vous voyez donc que le système de réserves obligatoires a été conçu en portant une attention toute particulière aux possibles effets de distorsion de la concurrence. Le résultat est un système léger et neutre, dont l’efficacité devrait néanmoins être grande puisque, comme je le laissais entendre tout à l’heure, il devrait permettre de réduire à un minimum la fréquence des opérations de réglage fin tout en contribuant à stabiliser les taux du marché monétaire.    … Les spécifications détaillées de la stratégie de politique monétaire seront bientôt annoncées    Les préparatifs ayant trait à la stratégie de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne sont d’ores-et-déjà bien avancés. Le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a déjà discuté de ce sujet. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a notamment examiné les avantages et inconvénients respectifs de diverses stratégies possibles, sur la base de travaux engagés par l’Institut monétaire européen et poursuivis par la Banque centrale européenne avec les banques centrales nationales. Certaines stratégies ont été écartées, comme par exemple la stratégie de ciblage des taux de change, inappropriée pour une région de la taille et de l’importance économiques de la zone euro, ayant de plus atteint un haut degré d’intégration. En fait, deux grands types de stratégies restent candidats, à savoir les stratégies fondées sur un objectif de croissance de la masse monétaire, d’une part, et d’autre part les stratégies fondées sur un objectif direct d’inflation. Une combinaison d’éléments pratiques des deux types de stratégie est toutefois également envisageable. Les deux types de stratégies se rejoignent bien entendu dans l’objectif ultime de stabilité des prix, duquel, comme je l’ai signalé tout à l’heure, la BCE a l’intention de publier une définition quantitative.      Conclusion    La réussite de l’Union économique et monétaire requiert beaucoup d’attention et de travail. De cette réussite dépend le développement d’une culture de la stabilité en Europe, garante d’un développement économique fort et équilibré. Je suis confiant que nous saurons ma îtriser les risques de l’entreprise. Dans mon intervention devant cet auditoire, j’ai essayé de montrer l’importance que la Banque centrale européenne attache à ses objectifs et aux principes de transparence et de responsabilité. Dans le domaine de la stratégie et des instruments de politique monétaire, j’ai également esquissé les résultats des travaux de la Banque centrale européenne, avant elle de l’Institut monétaire européen, et des banques centrales nationales. J’espère ainsi avoir montré quelle est la contribution décisive du Système européen de Banques centrales au succès de l’Union économique et monétaire.  ']\n",

Duisenberg', 'Close of the morning session of a Conference on \"Monnaie unique et fiscalité de l\\'épargne: quelle Europe financière?\" organised by the European Parliament', 'Remarks delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central BankBrussels, 23 September 1998', '  Close of the morning session of a Conference on \"Monnaie unique et fiscalité de l’épargne: quelle Europe financière?\" organised by the European Parliament   Remarks delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central BankBrussels, 23 September 1998      Introduction    I would like to express my appreciation for the interesting exchange of views which has taken place during this round table. As was made clear during the discussion, the structure of financial systems in Europe will evolve as the single currency is created. The ECB has already contributed to this evolution in many ways and will continue to do so in the future. I would like to make a few remarks on this topic.      Changes in European financial systems     European financial systems are evolving within a global environment, which has become more liberalised, international and concentrated. Changes of particular importance in the euro area include technological innovation in payment systems, the supply and trading of new derivative products, and the improvement and diffusion of new risk management techniques. Moreover, the environment of European financial systems is characterised by the Single Market, with new harmonised pieces of regulation and practices developed on the basis of, notably, the Banking Co-ordination Directives, the Capital Adequacy Directives and, importantly in the context of this Conference, the Investment Services Directive. The scope and organisation of financial activities in the euro area will also change as a result of the creation of the euro. First, money markets are going to be unified. Second, the focus of foreign exchange activities will of course shift to currencies outside the euro area. Third, the behaviour of participants in equity and bond markets is likely to be driven less by country-specific considerations and more by precise, sector-specific or issuer-specific considerations. This latter development is what some commentators have called the development of a \"credit risk culture\". This development is likely to improve the effectiveness of price formation on European bond and equity markets. This, in due time, will contribute to the smooth functioning of the financing of the euro area economy, as savings are likely to be channelled more efficiently and swiftly through the economy. As such, the development of a \"credit risk culture\" will therefore be a welcome product of European Monetary Union.      Contributions of the ECB    Let me now turn to the contributions that the European Central Bank has made, and will continue to make, to support the efficient working of financial markets in the euro area.      Price stability    The first and foremost contribution that the ECB aims to make is price stability. The European System of Central Banks will pursue its primary objective of maintaining price stability with determination. This should facilitate the formation of price expectations by market participants and contribute to financial stability in general. This environment will be beneficial to the efficiency of savings allocation amongst the various sectors of the economy of the euro area. There are several reasons for this. First, the achievement of price stability should help to reduce the uncertainty relating to the future path of inflation. This should enhance the information content of real and financial asset prices and improve the capacity of economic agents to select investment options efficiently. Second, price stability will contribute to protecting the value of savings, thereby avoiding the undesirable wealth re-distribution effects that inflation may cause. Third, in the long run, increased financial stability may contribute to reducing the likelihood of occurrence of asset price bubbles.      Payment systems    A second contribution of the ECB relates to the field of payment systems. The EMI, and now the ECB, have developed the TARGET system, which will be made available to market participants as from 4 January 1999. The system will ensure the unification of money markets in the euro area. It will reduce transaction costs for cross-border payments and greatly enhance security with regards to settlement risks and possible payment gridlocks. The ECB has also prepared, and is about to publish, a set of minimum standards which securities settlement systems should fulfil in order to be used in ESCB credit operations. This publication and other initiatives taken by the ECB have fostered the increased co-operation between securities settlement systems and depositories of the euro area.      Market rules and practices    A third contribution of the ECB relates to market rules and practices. Many commentators have recognised that European Monetary Union will contribute to the furthering of the harmonisation of market rules and practices. In accordance with the mandates given by treaties and statutes, the European Monetary Institute has taken, and now the European Central Bank takes, an active role in the promotion of adequate new market conventions and rules for the euro area, bearing in mind the principles of free competition.      Monetary policy framework of the ECB    Finally, financial markets will need to take into account the monetary policy framework of the ECB. The monetary policy framework of the ECB has been built so as to be very efficient for transmitting monetary policy, while at the same time being as neutral as possible with regard to financial structure. The neutrality and, indeed, market-friendliness, of the ECB’s framework is apparent in a variety of ways. First, neutrality is apparent in the way open market operations are conducted. Almost all of the ECB’s open market operations will be executed through tenders, to which a broad spectrum of counterparties may submit bids. This will be a transparent and fair process. Fine tuning open market operations may also be conducted through tenders, the so-called \"quick\" tenders. The ECB and the national central banks will aim at giving the opportunity to participate in fine tuning operations to all counterparties having an appropriate track record of activity in the money market, if necessary on a rotating basis. Second, the consideration of neutrality has been a driving factor in the process of establishment of the list of eligible assets. Eligible assets are the assets which counterparties have to post as guarantees for any credit received from the European System of Central Banks. The list of eligible assets comprises a wide variety of assets, which have been selected by the ECB according to area-wide uniform criteria relating to their credit standing in the whole euro area. In order to promote a certain degree of continuity at the start of the Third Stage of European Monetary Union, a sub-set (the so-called tier two eligible assets) includes assets of particular importance for certain national banking systems of the euro area. These assets have the same credit standing as the other assets. For monetary policy operations, counterparties will be able to use any eligible assets, irrespective of where they are located in the euro area. To this end, national central banks will act as correspondents for each other so as to make cross-border use possible also for assets for which this service is not yet provided by securities settlement systems. For the record, one may also mention the ECB’s system of risk control measures. Risk control measures will ensure that the amount of assets provided is always sufficient. When designing its system of risk control measures, the ECB has paid careful attention to the best market practices in this area. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the minimum reserve system of the ECB has been developed so as to be as neutral as possible. The minimum reserve system has two main objectives. The first objective is to stabilise money market interest rates. This will be achieved by requesting that average reserve holdings be above the minimum reserve requirements over monthly periods of time. This will allow the banking system to absorb liquidity shocks easily. The volatility of money market rates will, as a consequence, be reduced. Also, fine tuning operations will not have to be used frequently, which will mean that markets are less affected by central bank interventions than they would otherwise be. The second objective of the minimum reserve system is to enlarge the demand for central bank money, so as to enlarge the liquidity deficit of the banking system vis-à-vis the European System of Central Banks. This will safeguard the role of the European System of Central Banks as a key provider of liquidity to the banking system. In the minimum reserve system of the ECB, the reserve ratio will be rather small and reserve requirements will be fully remunerated. The reserve ratio will be set at between 1.5% and 2.5% and will be applied to the deposits, debt securities and money market paper issued by credit institutions, except for residual maturities above two years. Reserve holdings will be remunerated up to the required reserve level, at the rate of the ESCB’s main refinancing operation (as averaged over a month). It may be argued that a less than full remuneration of minimum reserves would increase the interest rate elasticity of central bank money demand. This notwithstanding, the European Central Bank has decided in favour of a full remuneration of minimum reserves in order to avoid the potential distortions to fair and efficient markets that a less than full remuneration could have implied. As a result, the minimum reserve system is unlikely to lead to any delocation of certain parts of the reserve base, hence of savings. Finally, it may also be useful to note that the European Central Bank has also decided not to exempt any credit institution of the euro area from the minimum reserve system.      Conclusion    I am confident that the policy of the ECB has always been, and will continue to be, guided by the principle of equal treatment, the desire to foster the development of financial markets in the euro area and the need to avoid undue shifts in economic activity. This will also contribute to providing an adequate environment for an efficient allocation of savings in the euro area.  ']\n",
      "['1998-09-22', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Statement to the European Parliament subcommittee on Monetary affairs', 'Delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, 22 September 1998', '  Statement to the European Parliament subcommittee on Monetary affairs   Delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, 22 September 1998 This is the first time that I, in my capacity as President of the European Central Bank (ECB), have the privilege to appear here at the European Parliament in accordance with Article 109b(3) of the Treaty. Today I should like to inform you, first, of the decisions that have been taken by the ECB since July and, second, of our schedule for the work still to be completed during the remainder of 1998. Afterwards I shall be happy to answer your questions.  First and foremost I should like to stress that our preparatory work for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is proceeding on schedule. You may be aware that we held two sets of meetings this month: meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and of the General Council of the ECB on 1 September 1998, and an additional meeting of the Governing Council on 11 September 1998. We decided to hold a second meeting in September because we felt that with regard to the long lead time, especially in those areas in which the preparatory work of our counterparties, i.e. the credit institutions, is affected by our decisions, we should move things forward faster. Today I am in a position to present to you quite a long list of important decisions taken recently by ECB bodies. I think that the list demonstrates that we have made very good progress in a number of areas. Let me please elaborate on the most important decisions relating to the preparatory work for Stage Three of EMU.       State of preparatory work        Exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area countries and other EU Member States    The General Council endorsed the text of an Agreement between the ECB and the non-euro area national central banks, laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three (the so-called ERM II). You will recall that the European Council in Amsterdam in June last year agreed to set up an exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three to replace the present European Monetary System (EMS). For this reason, the EMI prepared a draft Central Bank Agreement on the replacement of the current exchange rate mechanism with a new one in Stage Three. It is this Agreement which has now been signed by myself, as President of the ECB, and by the governors of the four non-euro area national central banks. The signing of this Agreement by the latter parties implies their acceptance of the operating procedures. It does not, however, imply their participation in ERM II.  For the currency of each Member State participating in the mechanism, a central rate against the euro and a standard fluctuation band of ±15% will be defined, in principle supported by automatic unlimited intervention at the margins, with very short-term financing available. However, the ECB and the participating non-euro area national central banks could suspend automatic intervention if this were to conflict with their primary objective of maintaining price stability. In line with the Resolution of the European Council, exchange rate policy co-operation may be further strengthened, for example by allowing closer exchange rate links between the euro and other currencies in the exchange rate mechanism, where, and to the extent that, this is appropriate in the light of progress towards convergence.       General documentation on ESCB monetary policy: instruments and procedures    Last Friday, 18 September 1998, the ECB published a report entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\". This report contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments and procedures to be applied by the ESCB in Stage Three of EMU. Hence it provides credit institutions with the information they need in order to prepare for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations as from 1 January 1999. The report expands upon and updates the material contained in an earlier version which was published by the EMI on 23 September 1997.  The report first sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by credit institutions in order to be eligible as counterparties to ESCB monetary policy operations. It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB and the ESCB\\'s two standing facilities (the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility). The report also contains a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations, and specifies the eligibility criteria and the risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB\\'s liquidity-providing operations. Moreover, the report includes the description of the features of the ESCB\\'s minimum reserve system and sets out specific provisions to be applied for the ESCB\\'s monetary policy instruments and procedures in the transition to Stage Three.  In this context I should also mention that on 11 September 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB endorsed the statistical framework on the basis of a number of reports that had been prepared by the EMI - many of which had been published in the past - thereby confirming the ECB\\'s statistical requirements for Stage Three. The reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the ECB is included in the \"General documentation\".  Furthermore, on 11 September 1998 the Governing Council endorsed a list of eligible securities settlement systems following an assessment of such systems against standards that had previously been laid down for their use in the credit operations of the ESCB. The list, which indicates those securities settlement systems that will be used by the ESCB and the conditions for their use, is set out in the \"General documentation\" as well.       Technical preparations for the euro banknotes    The technical preparations for the euro banknotes are proceeding according to schedule. The origination, i.e. the process of converting the designs into banknotes, has now been successfully completed. A zero-production run will be conducted in the autumn before mass production starts in early 1999.  The Governing Council of the ECB decided on 11 September 1998 that there will be no national feature on the euro banknotes. It also confirmed, in line with previous recommendations made by the EMI, that the following seven banknote denominations will be issued:  5,   10,   20,   50,   100,   200  and  500.       Schedules for the meetings of the Governing Council and General Council    In addition to its meetings scheduled for 13 October, 3 November and 1 December 1998, the Governing Council of the ECB has agreed to hold a further meeting on 22 December 1998. The Governing Council\\'s final meeting before the start of Stage Three will be devoted primarily to fine-tuning its last-minute preparations. The Governing Council has also decided that during the first year of Stage Three its meetings shall, as a rule, be scheduled to take place on Thursdays every other week, starting on 7 January 1999. Furthermore, the General Council has agreed that the current practice of holding quarterly meetings on the same day as meetings of the Governing Council should continue in Stage Three.  As far as the information policy of the ECB is concerned, I should like to mention that the ECB intends to hold a press conference, as a general rule, once a month. For the first three months of 1999, it envisages holding a press conference immediately after the first meeting of each month. It is my aim to pursue a policy of actively informing the public about the ECB\\'s decisions and the rationale behind them. In addition to press conferences, the public statements of the members of the Governing Council and the ECB\\'s regular publications will also contribute to achieving this goal. In its regular publications, for example, the ECB will report thoroughly on all aspects relevant to the conduct of the single monetary policy in the euro area. In particular, they will supply a detailed analysis of the developments upon which the respective monetary policy decisions are based. Apart from the publications foreseen in the Treaty, of which the Annual Report and the Quarterly Report are the most important ones, the ECB intends to publish a Monthly Bulletin.  In order to give a well-rounded picture I should like to draw your attention to one of the most recent ECB publications, the \"Report on electronic money\", before I turn to our schedule for the remainder of 1998.       The Report on electronic money    On 31 August 1998 the ECB published a \"Report on electronic money\". The report deepens the analysis of the implications of prepaid cards conducted by the EMI in 1994 and extends it to new forms of electronic money, i.e. software-based electronic money products which have since started to evolve. The main findings of the study were published in the Opinion of the EMI Council on the issuance of electronic money, which is contained in Chapter III of the EMI\\'s Annual Report 1997.  Although electronic money is not a widespread phenomenon at present, it is likely to have significant implications for monetary policy in the future. In this regard, it must be ensured that, in particular, price stability and the unit-of-account function of money are not put at risk. There are a number of additional regulatory concerns regarding electronic money which also have to be taken into account, such as the efficient functioning of payment systems and confidence in payment instruments, the protection of customers and merchants, the stability of financial markets and protection against criminal abuse.  With a view to ensuring monetary policy effectiveness and a level playing-field, and in order to address the regulatory concerns I have just outlined, the ECB regards it as essential that certain minimum requirements be fulfilled (see Chapter 4 of the Report).  I would like to stress in this context that the ECB follows with interest and close attention the European Commission\\'s work on a directive on electronic money and expects to be officially consulted in due time.        Schedule for the remainder of 1998    Given the huge volume of work to be completed during the remainder of the year it seemed to us appropriate to give priority to those issues relevant to credit institutions\\' preparatory work for Stage Three. The above-mentioned \"General documentation\" is one example of this, since credit institutions\\' preparations for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations as from 1 January 1999 were to a large extent dependent on the decisions to be taken by the Governing Council. Given the lead time in this field I consider the approach adopted to be very helpful.  The need to set priorities was also a major factor in opting to schedule our decision on euro area\\'s monetary strategy for the autumn of this year. The determination of a strategy for the single monetary policy is a very important decision to be taken. Nonetheless, the outcome of our proceedings does not have such a direct impact on our counterparties\\' preparations for Stage Three as the operational framework. Moreover, another reason for not yet having taken definite decisions regarding the monetary policy strategy is that the matter requires very thorough consideration. The Governing Council has already started with this discussion which will continue for some time. I can assure you that there are no fundamentally diverging opinions within the Governing Council concerning the orientation of our future monetary policy strategy. In this context, allow me to remind you that the EMI had already achieved a broad consensus regarding the monetary policy strategy. In particular, certain strategies, such as exchange rate targeting or nominal income targeting were explicitly excluded some time ago. Moreover, it was pointed out that the implementation of the two potential candidate strategies that had been identified, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting, may, in practice, be relatively similar. A combination of elements of both strategies was also considered as a possibility. Finally, there was no doubt within the EMI Council, that monetary policy decisions should be based on a broad range of indicator variables and that money would be assigned a prominent role, with either targets or monitoring ranges set for its growth, provided that money demand is sufficiently stable. The Governing Council of the ECB will continue to discuss the specification of the strategy along these lines over the months to come. The Governing Council will then specify the exact formulation of its strategy and its implementation in 1999 before the start of Stage Three.  I am at your disposal for any further questions.

      "['1998-09-18', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Signing of the Headquarters agreement', 'Welcome speech by Willem F. Duisenberg', '  Signing of the Headquarters agreement   Welcome speech by Willem F. Duisenberg Sehr geehrte Herren Bundesminister, Sehr geehrte Herr Ministerpräsident, Sehr geehrte Herr Staatsminister, Sehr verehrte Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, liebe Kollegen und Mitarbeiter, Sehr geehrte Herren Minister It is a great honour and a pleasure to welcome you, today, to the signing of the Headquarters Agreement between the European Central Bank (the \"ECB\") and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. The signing of this Agreement represents the completion of one more step forward in the preparation of the forthcoming commencement of the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union. The Agreement that you, Dr. Kinkel and Dr. Waigel, on behalf of the Federal Government, and I, on behalf of the ECB, are about to sign, essentially includes provisions for the application of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities. In particular it governs technical aspects relating to the status of the ECB as an institution of the European Community and of its staff on German territory and the relationship between the ECB and the German authorities. In contrast to the ECB’s predecessor, the European Monetary Institute, the ECB will conduct banking operations as from the start of Stage Three. Accordingly, legal precautions were called for, to ensure that this will be possible without limitations in the context of the fulfilment by the ECB of its duties. The Federal Government thereby fully recognises the supranational character of the ECB in its field of activity. I should like to thank the Federal Government for the speed with which it has handled the negotiations, thus enabling the Agreement to be signed today and the ratification procedure to be initiated straight afterwards. We are assuming that the legislative process will have been concluded by the end of 1998 and that it will be possible for the Agreement to come into force in time for the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union.  I should now like to invite you to sign the Agreement.  ']\n",
      "['1998-09-18', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Signing ceremony for the Headquarters Agreement', 'Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the signing ceremony for the Headquarters Agreement on 18 September 1998', '  Signing ceremony for the Headquarters Agreement   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the signing ceremony for the Headquarters Agreement on 18 September 1998 forms of address: Sehr geehrte Herren Bundesminister, Sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident, Sehr geehrter Herr Staatsminister, Sehr verehrte Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, liebe Kollegen und Mitarbeiter, It was exactly three years ago - on 12 September 1995 - though in a different composition, that representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the European Monetary Institute met in this very building to sign the Headquarters Agreement. Today representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the European Central Bank have gathered here for the same purpose. Now, as then, we are to settle the details of the relations between a European institution and an EU Member State, as the host country of this institution, its staff and their families.  These are two very similar events, though occurring under entirely different circumstances. At the time of the signing of the first Headquarters Agreement, in 1995, the EMI had only been established for nineteen months and had moved into its premises only a year earlier. It faced the very difficult task of preparing the framework necessary for the European System of Central Banks to perform its tasks in the third stage of EMU. There was not much time left until the end of 1996, the first deadline, which was turned down by the Member States, and subsequently until the mid-1998 deadline. President Lamfalussy, my predecessor as President of the EMI, rightly referred to this task as an unprecedented and historic one. No single past experience could guide us in the establishment of Economic and Monetary Union. Differences in culture, history, political tradition and, indeed, in approaches to central banking among the initially twelve and later fifteen national central banks, made the tasks of the EMI particularly challenging. Nonetheless, and I should emphasise this immediately, Mr. Lamfalussy clearly stated with his imperturbable confidence that, in any case, it would not be the EMI that would delay the start of EMU.  My predecessor was right. The EMI did indeed do its homework and achieve its goals. The ESCB was finally established on 1 June this year, that is to say, around half a year in advance of the launch of the euro. The ECB was thus given time to set up and to staff its own organisation, to adopt the framework for the conduct of the common monetary policy from 1 January 1999 onwards, to test all the systems and procedures within this framework and to ensure a smooth transition from the current national monetary policies to the future single monetary policy.  Today, I am in a position to share the same optimism expressed by Mr. Lamfalussy. The Governing Council of the ECB has, in the meantime, taken decisive steps to render the ECB fully operational by the end of the year. Allow me to raise a few points in this context. Notwithstanding the unequivocal provisions of the Treaty with regard to the independence of the ECB, concerns have been voiced that the ECB might be unaccountable and act in an untransparent way. These concerns are unfounded. The independence of the ECB, while enabling it to bring about price stability, is clearly related to accountability to the general public. The ECB will be as transparent as possible and undertake to explain its policy in full to the public. This will be accompanied by a thorough analysis of all aspects of economic and monetary developments. By pursuing its objective of price stability, the ECB will make a major contribution to supporting the economic policiesy in the Community, as it is required to do by the Treaty on European Union. The ECB will take its obligation to respect democratic accountability to other European institutions very seriously.  The Governing Council has decided that it will always explain its decisions to the public, by means of a press conference or a press release, after every meeting. Moreover, there will be many other communications, such as the official publications, speeches, interviews, articles, etc. This transparency will undoubtedly contribute to fostering the credibility of monetary policy in the financial markets and to stabilising market expectations.  A further point worth mentioning here is the widespread agreement reached by the Governing Council in the meantime with regard to the instruments of monetary policy. The range of instruments to be employed is more or less complete, and the testing of these instruments is well under way. Considerable progress has also been made with regard to the definition of a single monetary policy strategy. A final decision is expected in the coming months.  Whilst aware of the risks we face in the run-up to EMU, I am confident that the prospects for a stable single currency are good. The ECB will have at its disposal a sophisticated infrastructure and will be operational in time to take over responsibility for monetary policy within the euro area from 1999 onwards. The Headquarters Agreement, that we have just signed, will serve as a building block to support the ECB.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank again all those who have contributed to the timely completion of an agreement satisfactory to all concerned. I am grateful to Dr. Klaus Kinkel, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, for his recent letter in which he conveyed the positive attitude of the Federal Government towards the establishment of a European School in Frankfurt. More generally, I should like to express my gratitude to all our counterparts in Bonn, Wiesbaden and Frankfurt for their co-operation in helping the ECB, its staff and their families to settle in and make themselves at home in Frankfurt.

Duisenberg, anläßlich des Verbandstages des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken am 17. September 1998 in Dresden', '  Auf dem Weg zum Euro   Vortrag des Präsidenten der Europäischen Zentralbank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, anläßlich des Verbandstages des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken am 17. September 1998 in Dresden Sehr geehrter Herr Bundeskanzler, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Ich freue mich aufrichtig quasi am Vorabend des Starts der Europäischen Währungsunion anläßlich des großen Verbandstages des Bundesverbandes zu Ihnen sprechen zu können.  Am 1. Januar 1999 beginnt die dritte Stufe der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. Ein historischer Schritt, der völlig zu Recht als Meilenstein in der europäischen Integrationspolitik bezeichnet wird.  Seit Jahren arbeiten europäische Institutionen und Gremien, nicht zuletzt das Europäische Währungsinstitut (EWI) und die nationalen Notenbanken, daran das Projekt der Europäischen Währungsunion (EWU) zum Erfolg zu führen. Im Juni dieses Jahres hat die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) das EWI abgelöst.  Der Euro bringt uns die große Chance, das wichtige Ziel der Preisstabilität in Europa umfassend und dauerhaft zu verwirklichen. Geldwertstabilität ist der beste Beitrag der Geldpolitik zu anhaltendem Wirtschaftswachstum und zum langfristigen Abbau der Arbeitslosigkeit. Stabile Preise tragen zu einem besseren Funktionieren des Binnenmarktes und zur Schaffung einer international anerkannten Währung bei.  Am ersten Maiwochenende dieses Jahres haben die Staats- und Regierungschefs der Europäischen Union entschieden, daß der Euro am 1. Januar 1999 zunächst in elf Mitgliedstaaten eingeführt wird. Am 31. Dezember dieses Jahres wird der Umrechnungskurs zwischen den Währungen der teilnehmenden Länder unwiderruflich fixiert und zwar entsprechend den ebenfalls im Mai vorangekündigten bilateralen Wechselkursen.  Ab diesem Zeitpunkt gibt es für den gesamten Euro-Währungsraum nur noch eine einheitliche Geldpolitik, für die ausschließlich das Europäische System der Zentralbanken (ESZB), d.h. die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) und die nationalen Zentralbanken der teilnehmenden Länder, zuständig ist. Die geldpolitische Verantwortung geht auf den EZB-Rat über, in dem neben den sechs Mitgliedern des EZB-Direktoriums alle elf Präsidenten der nationalen Zentralbanken vertreten sind.  Natürlich ist eine so weitreichende Entscheidung wie die Einführung einer gemeinsamen europäischen Währung nicht völlig ohne Risiken - dies liegt in der Natur der Sache. Aus diesem Blickwinkel ist Skepsis gegenüber der EWU und der neuen Währung durchaus verständlich. Angesichts neuer Herausforderungen für die Wirtschaftspolitik wie sie die Globalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen darstellt, gibt es allerdings keine Alternative zur Weiterentwicklung der europäischen Integration. Die Entscheidung für die Währungsunion ist die beste Anwort auf die veränderten wirtschaftspolitischen Bedingungen.  Die Vorbereitungen für die EWU laufen auf Hochtouren. Da es für dieses Projekt kein Vorbild gibt sind die Arbeiten nicht immer ganz einfach. Niemand kann mit Blick auf Erfahrungen eindeutig sagen: das ist richtig, das ist falsch.  Von Seiten des ESZB, meine Damen und Herren, kann ich Ihnen versichern, daß alles getan wird, daß die Währungsunion ein Erfolg wird. Die Funktionsfähigkeit der einheitlichen europäischen Geldpolitik wird bereits zu Beginn der EWU sicher gestellt sein. Die Komplexität der Materie und der immense Arbeits- und Zeitdruck stellen sowohl an die Mitarbeiter der EZB und der nationalen Zentralbanken als auch an die private Kreditwirtschaft höchste Anforderungen. Die technischen Vorbereitungen des ESZB auf die Währungsunion sind weitgehend abgeschlossen und wir werden Sie morgen, mit der Veröffentlichung der „Allgemeinen Regelungen\" der geldpolitischen Operationen über unseren endgültigen Handlungsrahmen informieren. Lassen Sie mich Ihnen in diesem Zusammenhang kurz das geldpolitische Instrumentarium des ESZB skizzieren. Die EZB wird hauptsächlich mit Offenmarktinstrumenten in Form von Wertpapierpensionsgeschäften, sogenannten Repos, agieren, woran Sie in Deutschland schon seit Jahrzehnten gewöhnt sind.Sie haben sich mittlerweile bei allen nationalen Zentralbanken als marktgerechtes und effektives Instrument durchgesetzt. Das Hauptgeschäft wird in wöchentlichem Abstand mit einer Laufzeit von jeweils zwei Wochen abgeschlossen werden.  Daneben wird das ESZB längerfristige Repos anbieten. Diese Geschäfte nehmen mit einer Laufzeit von drei Monaten ein wichtiges Element des Diskontkredits auf, der in Deutschland und österreich bisher noch häufig verwendet wurde, den es aber in der einheitlichen Geldpolitik nicht mehr geben wird. Spezifische Bestimmungen werden sicherstellen, daß insbesondere den kleinen Banken der Zugang zu diesem Instrument leicht gemacht wird. Um unerwarteten Liquiditäts- und damit auch Zinsschwankungen angemessen begegnen zu können, kann das ESZB auch auf ein breites Spektrum von Feinsteuerungsoperationen, wie etwa befristete Transaktionen oder Devisenswaps, zurückgreifen.  Zudem hat das ESZB zwei sogenannte \"ständige\" Fazilitäten zur Verfügung, deren Inanspruchnahme auf Initiative der Geschäftspartner erfolgt. Es wird eine Spitzenrefinanzierungsfazilität und eine Einlagenfazilität geben. Die Spitzenrefinanzierungsfazilität entspricht dabei weitgehend dem deutschen Lombard. Sie ist in erster Linie ein Sicherheitsventil bei kurzfristigen Liquiditätsengpässen im Bankensystem und begrenzt damit die Ausschläge der Geldmarktsätze nach oben. Gewissermaßen das Gegenstück ist die kurzfristige Einlagenfazilität, die kurzfristige Liquiditätsüberschüsse abfangen soll und die Untergrenze für die Geldmarktsätze bildet. In der Juli-Sitzung des EZB-Rates wurde die Einführung einer europäischen Mindestreserve definitiv beschlossen. Die Mindestreservepflicht ist für den Durchschnitt eines Monats definiert. Dies bedeutet, daß die Kreditinstitute kurzfristige Liquiditätsschwankungen über ihr Mindestreservekonto ausgleichen können, ohne den Geldmarkt in Anspruch nehmen zu müssen. Die Mindestreserve wird damit wesentlich dazu beitragen, störende Volatilitäten der Geldmarktsätze zu vermeiden, ohne daß das ESZB häufige Feinsteuerungsmaßnahmen ergreifen muß.  Bei der Einführung der Mindestreserve mußte der EZB-Rat eine schwierige Abwägung zwischen zwei konkurrierenden Zielen treffen. Zum einen ging es um die Frage, ob die Mindestreserve zum Zweck der Geldmengenkontrolle eingesetzt werden sollte. Dies hätte es wünschenswert gemacht, die Mindestreserve nicht oder nur gering zu verzinsen. Zum anderen war es dem EZB-Rat auch wichtig, die potentielle Belastung für den privaten Sektor und die möglichen Auswirkungen auf die Wettbewerbssituation der Kreditinstitute in der Eurozone zu berücksichtigen.  Der EZB-Rat hat sich in dieser Situation dafür entschieden, dem zweiten Erwägungsgrund Vorrang zu geben und die Mindestreserve beim Start der Währungsunion voll, d.h. zum Reposatz des ESZB, zu verzinsen. In diesem Punkt unterscheidet sich das zukünftige europäische Mindestreservesystem grundsätzlich vom bisherigen deutschen. Ich möchte betonen, daß auch andere Aspekte des Mindestreservesystems mit Rücksicht auf die Absicht gesetzt wurden, unnötige Belastungen des Bankensektors zu vermeiden. Der vorläufig festgelegte Mindestreservesatz wird nur etwa 1,5 bis 2,5% betragen. Dieser Satz erscheint - zur Zeit - hoch genug, um Volatilitäten der Geldmarktsätze zu vermeiden und die Nachfrage nach Zentralbankgeld ausreichend zu erhöhen. Zudem wurde ein Freibetrag in einer Größenordnung von 100.000 Euro ins Auge gefaßt. Daher werden sehr kleine Kreditinstitute keine Mindestreserve halten müssen. Was den Stand der Diskussion über die geldpolitische Strategie angeht, so hat es bereits im EWI-Rat erhebliche Annäherungen gegeben. Die notwendigen Vorbereitungen sind bereits in einem fortgeschrittenen Stadium. Nach intensiver Prüfung hat das EWI verschiedene Strategien wie etwa die Wechselkursorientierung für das Eurogebiet als eindeutig ungeeignet erkannt und bereits ausgeschlossen. In der engeren Auswahl sind zwei Strategien geblieben. Zum einen die Geldmengensteuerung, also jenes Konzept, das von der Deutschen Bundesbank über zwanzig Jahren hinweg angewandt wurde. Zum anderen ein direktes Inflationsziel, wie es derzeit insbesondere die Bank von England anwendet. Aber auch Kombinationen von bestimmten Elementen dieser beiden Strategien sind vorstellbar. In der praktischen Umsetzung ist der Unterschied zwischen diesen beiden geldpolitischen Konzeptionen nicht sehr groß. Das Beispiel verschiedener Länder zeigt, daß es viele Varianten gibt, die Elemente beider Strategiekonzepte verbinden. Beide Strategien haben Preisstabilität als primäres Ziel, sie sind vorausschauend und bedienen sich einer Reihe von Indikatoren um die Angemessenheit der geldpolitischen Ausrichtung zu beurteilen.  Das EWI hat eine Reihe von Schlüsselelementen für die Strategie der EZB empfohlen. Einigkeit bestand darin, daß die EZB eine quantitative Definition von Preisstabilität vorgeben sollte. Auch gab es keine Zweifel, die geldpolitischen Entscheidungen letztlich auf der sorgfältigen Analyse eines breiten Spektrums von Indikatoren basieren zu lassen. Die endgültige Entscheidungsbefugnis liegt beim EZB-Rat, in dem es zu den wesentlichen Fragen eine breite übereinstimmung gibt.   Ich kann Ihnen versichern, daß es im EZB-Rat über die Ausrichtung unserer monetären Strategie keine fundamentalen Meinungsverschiedenheiten gibt. Es ist jedoch wichtig, eine sorgfältig abgewogene Entscheidung zu treffen, die dem einzigartigen Charakter der Einführung der einheitlichen Währung Rechnung trägt.  Was nun die Umsetzung der Geldpolitik in die Praxis anbelangt, stellen sich für das ESZB auch auf mittlere Sicht besondere Herausforderungen. Eine künftig die gesamte Eurozone umfassende geldpolitische Perspektive erfordert die Entwicklung eines entsprechenden statistischen Rahmens und eine Verschiebung des Schwerpunkts bei den volkswirtschaftlichen Analysen. Das ESZB kann auf besondere Entwicklungen in der monetären und wirtschaftlichen Lage einzelner Länder keine Rücksicht nehmen. Allein das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet als Einheit steht künftig im Blickwinkel der Geldpolitiker.  Leistungsfähige und europaweit einheitliche Statistiken, z.B. über die monetäre Entwicklung und die Zahlungsbilanzsituation, wurden in diesen Wochen und Monaten in der EZB zusammengestellt. Sie werden die Basis für geldpolitische Analysen und Entscheidungen.  Ein solches Umdenken und Fokussieren auf das gesamte Euro-Währungsgebiet wird auch von den Mitgliedern des EZB-Rates verlangt. Bislang waren die geldpolitischen Entscheidungsträger gewohnt, sich vornehmlich von nationalen Entwicklungen leiten zu lassen. Die einheitliche europäische Geldpolitik läßt für regionale bzw. länderspezifische Geldpolitiken, wie erwähnt, keinerlei Raum. Es ist das vorrangige Ziel des ESZB, die Preisstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet zu gewährleisten.  All dies ist im Vertrag von Maastricht bedacht. Nicht umsonst sehen die Satzungen des ESZB laut Maastricht-Vertrag keine Stimmgewichtung in Abhängigkeit von Größe und wirtschaftlicher Bedeutung der Teilnehmerstaaten vor. Bei geldpolitischen Entscheidungen hat grundsätzlich jedes Mitglied nur eine Stimme. Auch die im Vertrag angelegte Vertraulichkeit der Sitzungen stellt sicher, daß einzelne Mitglieder des EZB-Rates für ihr Verhalten aus rein nationalen Gesichtspunkten nicht unter Druck gesetzt werden könnten. Die Mitglieder des EZB-Rates sind sich wohl bewußt, daß sie ihr Augenmark weg von regionalen oder nationalen überlegungen auf die Geldwertstabilität im gesamten Euro-Gebiet richten müssen. Die Analyse und Bewertung der Daten für den EWU-Raum wird all unser Können erfordern. Es dürfte Ihnen nicht unbekannt sein, daß eine vorausschauende Geldpolitik auch Analysen der künftigen Wirtschaftsentwicklung unerläßlich macht. Gerade am Anfang der Währungsunion werden wir diesbezüglich vor große Herausforderungen gestellt. Besonders wichtig scheint mir in diesem Zusammenhang, daß die Einführung der Euro und der Start der Währungsunion zu Verhaltensänderungen der am wirtschaftlichen Leben Beteiligten führen kann. Es kann auch nicht ausgeschlossen werden, daß diese Verhaltensänderungen der Wirtschaftsakteure wiederum eine Veränderung in der Vergangenheit etablierter Wirtschaftsbeziehungen zur Folge haben könnte. Dieses Phänomen, mit einem Fachausdruck als „Regime-Shift\" bezeichnet, hat zur Folge, daß in der Vergangenheit empirisch gut abgesicherte wirtschaftliche Zusammenhänge nur bedingt für Aussagen über die Zukunft zu verwenden sind.  Ich hatte bereits erwähnt, daß die Hauptaufgabe des ESZB darin besteht, für interne Geldwertstabilität zu sorgen. Mehr zu verlangen, hieße die Geldpolitik zu überfordern. Der beste Beitrag der Geldpolitik zu Wirtschafts- und Beschäftigungswachstum bzw. zum langfristigen Abbau von Arbeitslosigkeit, besteht darin, Preisstabilität bei relativ niedrigen Zinsen dauerhaft zu erhalten.  Ohne eine ausgeprägte Stabilitätskultur, ohne die breite Unterstützung der Bevölkerung und ohne eine solide Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik ist ein stabiler und international anerkannter Euro allerdings auf Dauer nicht möglich. Das Europäische System der Zentralbanken benötigt daher die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik in den Teilnehmerstaaten. Die Einhaltung der Regeln des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes sind hierbei von höchster Bedeutung. Ebenso wichtig sind weitere strukturelle, marktwirtschaftlich orientierte Reformen. Eine Senkung der Steuer- und Abgabenlast, die Flexibilisierung der Arbeits- und Produktmärkte sowie eine verantwortungsbewußte Lohnpolitik sind entscheidende Ansatzpunkte zur dringend gebotenen nachhaltigen Verbesserung der Beschäftigungssituation. Eine so ausgerichtete Politik würde es dem Europäischen System der Zentralbanken erleichtern, sein Mandat und die daran geknüpften Erwartungen bestmöglich auszufüllen.  Lassen Sie mich in diesem Zusammenhang noch einmal den Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt, auf den sich der Europäische Rat am 16./17. Juni 1997 in Amsterdam verständigt hat, hervorheben. Dieser Pakt erweitert und präzisiert das im Maastricht-Vertrag (Artikel 103) verankerte Verfahren der multilateralen überwachung der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen sowie das (in Artikel 104c geregelte) Verfahren zur Vermeidung übermäßiger Defizite in einem oder mehreren Mitgliedstaaten. Mit diesem Pakt verpflichten sich die Mitgliedstaaten, ihre öffentlichen Haushalte mittelfristig nahezu ausgeglichen oder sogar im überschuß zu halten.  Die Einhaltung des Vertrages macht es möglich, die automatischen Stabilisatoren in der Fiskalpolitik wirken zu lassen, ohne gleichzeitig untragbare Defizite und Schuldenstände zu riskieren, die ohne Zweifel auf Dauer negative Folgen für die Preisstabilität hätten. Auch wenn gegenwärtig niedrige langfristige Zinsen in den teilnehmenden Staaten von einem gewissen Glaubwürdigkeitvorschuß für die zukünftige Geldpolitik zeugen, ist die fiskalische Konsolidierung in den Mitgliedstaaten energischer voranzutreiben als es zum Teil 1998 erfolgt und für 1999 geplant ist. In einigen Mitgliedsstaaten wird selbst ein ausgeglichenes Budget nicht ausreichen, sondern ein Budgetüberschuss vonnöten sein, um den hohen Schuldenstand gemessen am Bruttoinlandsprodukt zu reduzieren. Ich bin davon überzeugt, daß eine erfolgreiche Umsetzung der Ziele des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes zum Aufbau der Glaubwürdigkeit der Geldpolitik und zur Stabilität des Euros wesentlich beitragen kann. Auch im Rahmen der Wechselkurspolitik gilt der Vorrang für die Preisstabilität in der Eurozone. So nimmt das ERM II, das beim Europäischen Gipfel von Amsterdam beschlossen wurde und die Währungen der EU-Länder außerhalb des Euro-Raums fester an den Euro binden soll, Rücksicht auf die Sicherung der internen Geldwertstabilität. Die EZB kann nämlich die Initiative für Leitkursänderungen ergreifen oder Interventionen (und deren Finanzierung) aussetzen, wenn die Interventionsverpflichtungen zur Gefahr für die Preisstabilität zu werden drohen.  In der Sitzung des EZB-Rates am 11. September dieses Jahres wurde ein Abkommen zwischen der EZB und den vier nichtteilnehmenden Notenbanken unterzeichnet, welches die Geschäftsbedingungen des im Juni 1997 beschlossenen ERM II festlegt. Demnach löst das ERM II in Stufe III das gegenwärtige Europäische Währungssystem (EWS) ab. Das ERM II soll sicherstellen, daß die vorerst nicht an der EWU teilnehmenden Staaten eine stabilitätsorientierte Politik betreiben. Weiterhin soll die Teilnahme am Wechselkursmechanismus den Konvergenzprozess dieser Länder unterstützen und die zukünftige Einführung des Euro erleichtern. Mit ihrer Unterschrift, bestätigen die Notenbanken ihr Einverständnis mit den Bedingungen des ERM II, aber nicht automatisch ihre Teilnahme.  Nach Artikel 109 des Maastricht-Vertrages kann der Ministerrat prinzipiell, und zwar einstimmig auf Empfehlung der EZB (oder der Kommission und nach Anhörung der EZB), förmliche Vereinbarungen über ein Wechselkurssystem für den Euro gegenüber Drittlandswährungen treffen. Ein neues internationales, insbesondere auch weltweites Wechselkurssystem ist derzeit allerdings nicht in Sicht. Dazu sind die globalen ökonomischen Bedingungen zu unterschiedlich. Eine allgemeine Orientierung der Wechselkurspolitik gegenüber Drittlandswährungen darf das vorrangige Ziel des ESZB, Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten, keinesfalls beeinträchtigen. Insgesamt scheint der Euro damit auch gegen außenwirtschaftliche Gefährdungen seiner Stabilität durch Interventionsverpflichtungen abgesichert zu sein. Zumal der Europäische Rat auf seiner Tagung in Luxemburg im Dezember 1997 beschlossen hat, daß solche Wechselkursorientierungen nur ausnahmsweise, etwa in Fällen eines eindeutigen Misalignments, formuliert werden sollten.  Zur Sicherung des Geldwertes ist die EZB mit einer umfassenden Unabhängigkeit ausgestattet. Die Mitglieder des EZB-Rates handeln unabhängig von den Weisungen nationaler Regierungen und Institutionen, wie auch unabhängig von europäischen Organen oder Einrichtungen der Gemeinschaft. Die Unabhängigkeit gilt übrigens nicht nur für die EZB, sondern auch für die nationalen Notenbanken der teilnehmenden Staaten.  Zur Erhaltung der Preisstabilität und Verstärkung der Glaubwürdigkeit der Geldpolitik sind daneben auch Transparenz und Rechenschaftspflicht von zentraler Bedeutung. Empirische Beispiele zeigen, daß ein hohes Maß an Information über die Zielsetzung und die Begründung geldpolitischer Maßnahmen letztlich deren Wirksamkeit erhöhen kann. Insoweit Transparenz die Unsicherheit der Märkte und der öffentlichkeit bezüglich der geldpolitischen Handlungen reduziert, wirkt sie darüber hinaus vertrauensbildend. Transparenz erleichtert folglich den Aufbau von Reputation und Glaubwürdigkeit. Auch teile ich die Auffassung, daß eine unabhängige währungspolitische Behörde, wie die EZB, ihre Entscheidungen in einer demokratischen Gesellschaft stets rechtfertigen sollte. Der Maastricht-Vertrag enthält genau festgelegte Berichtspflichten gegenüber dem Ministerrat und dem Europäischen Parlament. Diese Verpflichtung zur Rechenschaft wird im angelsächsischen mit dem Stichwort der \"democratic accountability\" bezeichnet.  In Entsprechung des Transparenzgrundsatzes und Erfüllung der Rechenschaftspflicht hat der EZB-Rat entschieden, der öffentlichkeit die wichtigsten Ergebnisse der Beratungen in Form einer Pressekonferenz und/oder eines schriftlichen Kommuniqués mitzuteilen. Dies ist bereits mehrfach geschehen. Diese Einrichtung stellt, neben Publikationen, Reden, Interviews und Artikeln, einen wichtigen Eckpfeiler der Kommunikationspolitik des ESZB mit der öffentlichkeit dar. Zudem werden wir weitgehende Analysen zu allen Aspekten der Geldpolitik und auch zur allgemeinen Wirtschaftspolitik erstellen. So kann die EZB einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Unterstützung der allgemeinen Wirtschaftspolitik in der Gemeinschaft leisten. Es wurden Befürchtungen geäußert, daß der EZB-Rat insbesondere zu Beginn der Währungsunion mit überhöhten Zinsen versuchen könnte, den Aufbau von Glaubwürdigkeit der europäischen Geldpolitik zu unterstützen. Lassen Sie mich in diesem Zusammenhang klar feststellen, daß wir die Geldpolitik so ausrichten werden, daß Preisstabilität bestmöglich erhalten werden kann. Es gibt keinen Grund restriktiver zu sein, als es dieses Ziel erfordert. Nicht nur Inflation, auch Deflation ist unvereinbar mit Preisstabilität. Nach dieser kurzen Tour d’Horizon über den Stand der Vorbereitung des ESZB auf den Start der Währungsunion, gestatten Sie mir nun, sehr verehrte Damen und Herren, zum Ende meiner Ausführungen nochmals zu betonen, daß von seiten der europäischen Geldpolitik alles getan wird, die EWU zum Erfolg zu führen und den Euro zu einer stabilen und weltweit geachteten Währung zu machen. Dies ist keine leichte Aufgabe, da werden Sie mir sicherlich zustimmen. Eine gute Zusammenarbeit mit der privaten Kreditwirtschaft liegt uns hierbei sehr am Herzen.   ']\n",

Padoa-Schioppa, membro del Comitato direttivo della Banca Centrale Europea a Francoforte: è un onore per noi e per la nostra scuola estiva. Mi permetto anche di parlare di un sollievo, visto che le turbolenze di Borsa non gli hanno impedito di venire qui da noi a Bressanone.    Meine Damen und Herren, ich gestatte mir persönlich hinzuzufügen, wie sehr es mich freut, daß damit ein Mitbürger Frankfurts (für die nächsten 7 Jahre) den Weg zu uns nach Brixen gefunden hat. Für uns in der Sommerschule ist dies das Hauptereignis, nämlich die einzige öffentliche Sitzung. Also gestatte ich mir auch, bei dieser Gelegenheit unsere Gäste ganz besonders herzlich zu begrüßen.    Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Brixen summer school\\'s organisation committee and of the European Academy, and bearing in mind that the European Commission is the main sponsor of this event, I should like to welcome Mr. Padoa-Schioppa here as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt - moreover, the member elected with the highest number of votes by the European Parliament! (Applause) The circumstances of that election prove that you are so well known that I do not have to say much more by way of introduction, but I should nonetheless like to recall your distinguished career in the Banca d\\'Italia, at the European Commission in Brussels and as the Surveyor of the Italian Stock Exchanges. Your work for the Delors Committee on European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has made you one of its founding fathers. You are the author of an amazingly large number of books and articles on monetary matters. We had agreed that you should speak here about the functioning of European Economic and Monetary Union and the role of the European Central Bank in particular. We are grateful that you will be available afterwards for a discussion which may also touch on current policy problems. The floor is yours. Thank you. (Applause)       Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa:    Thank you very much. I am happy and honoured to be here tonight. The assumption underlying your applause is that to be liked by the European Parliament is a good sign for a central banker. I am not sure that this is always the way central bankers feel, and so I may, in fact, have to recover from that vote, rather than build upon it! I am particularly happy, Duncan, to see you again after so many years. If I may, I should like to make a personal reference. Duncan Foley was my teacher at MIT 30 years ago. He was then teaching a very different kind of economics from that which he has taught subsequently, if my information is correct, but he was an extraordinary teacher for me. When I came back to Italy, I remember giving some seminars on Foley\\'s Sidrauski model. These gave me the reputation of being almost a reactionary in an Italian intellectual environment that was thinking along very different lines from that model. Well, many things have now changed. 30 years have seen many, many changes, and I am very happy to see you here. The title of this lecture - although I think of this talk more as of a kind of conversation - that Professor Schefold and myself have chosen is \"On the eve of the euro\". First, I shall elaborate upon this title by recapitulating the steps involved in reaching this eve. I shall then go on to say something about what, in my view, is special about EMU. Third, I shall describe what is happening during this eve.      How did we get here?    \"Eve\" refers to the period in which the European Central Bank is already in existence, but has not fully assumed its monetary policy functions. It will do so on 1 January 1999. It is a period of several months, of which we have just about reached the middle. Thus, how did we arrive at the inception of the European Central Bank? It has been a long process. Indeed, I could say that it started with the Treaty of Rome in 1957. I do not know how many of you are familiar with this extraordinary book that every economist should read, because it contains, in legal language, many implicit and some explicit propositions about the way in which the economy should function and economic policy should operate. The Treaty has proved, over a period of 40 years, to be extremely powerful and flexible in many ways. One of the implicit propositions is that, in order to have a Common Market (as it was called at the time), it is necessary to have a corresponding monetary order, in other words, I would suggest, some kind of monetary union. This proposition is only implicit because, in the mid-1950s, this kind of system existed in reality. At the time, the system of fixed exchange rates created at Bretton Woods was such a key component of the world economic order that it was taken for granted that it would last. In fact, it was not even the subject of much discussion, except for a few references to exchange rates. Most of the efforts in the early years following the birth of the European Community in 1958 were devoted to scaling down tariffs, which were of a much smaller order of magnitude than the fluctuations on foreign exchange markets in the present floating situation. If it was considered such a difficult task to abolish tariffs while nothing was said about exchange rates, this is because exchange rates were taken as being fixed. Thus, we could say that there was a monetary union in the beginning, and this was the Bretton Woods system. When, about 10 years later, that system started to show signs of weakness, discussions began in the European Community on replacing it with an arrangement that would grant stable exchange rates at least for intra-European relationships. The notion of economic and monetary union, this very expression, is used for the first time in 1969 and 1970. The second decade of the approximately 40-year period since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, say from 1969 to 1979, saw the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, repeated devaluations and all types of inflation; it also coincides with a period in which the process of European integration virtually came to a halt. The third decade begins in 1979 with the launch of the European Monetary System, the first successful attempt to organise a European exchange rate system designed to provide, at least within Europe, fixed but adjustable exchange rates. The forth decade begins in 1988 when - and again I am focusing solely on the monetary line of development, disregarding the many other things that happened on the European scene - the Delors Committee was created in June 1988 in order to study economic and monetary union and its implementation in various stages. The history of EMU - all I have said so far has concerned the \"prehistory\" - started then. As stated above, the \"prehistoric\" phase ends with the creation of the Delors Committee, and the \"historical\" phase, of which we are now nearing the conclusion, began just 10 years ago when the Heads of State or of Government decided (and there had been much preparatory work behind that decision) to create a committee to develop the project of Monetary Union. The said Committee was chaired by Jacques Delors; it was composed of all the twelve governors of the national central banks of the European Community and a small number of \"lay\" members. Since then, between June 1988 and, say, June 1998, when the ECB came into existence, a rather extraordinary sequence of events has occurred: a very ambitious project has been launched and implemented, because the creation of a single currency and a single central bank for a number of sovereign countries which have not yet merged into a federation is something that has never previously been attempted. This project, owing to a series of special circumstances, never fell from the top of the agenda of the European leaders, showing a degree of continuity that is rare in international negotiations. In many countries the political parties holding the balance of power changed, mainly because of economic events, cyclical changes in the economy, etc. Yet, the project was never cancelled. The Bretton Woods conference had lasted two and half weeks. The negotiations leading to the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community, from the moment when the original idea was conceived in Messina (1956) to the moment when the institutions came into existence (1958), lasted little more than two years. Normally, in international affairs, favourable constellations are short-lived and things have to be done fast. It is remarkable that the favourable constellation present in the run-up to EMU has lasted for so long. The 10 years from June 1988 to June 1998 can be divided into two distinct periods of about five years: a period of negotiations on, and design of, the project, which began with the creation of the Delors Committee and ended with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty; and a period of preparation, mainly of the macroeconomic conditions, which has come to be known as economic convergence. You will always notice the involvement of Germany and, most often, Chancellor Kohl at the watersheds of both these periods. Kohl was in Hannover in June 1988 and he was in Brussels in May 1998. Germany was the last country to ratify the Maastricht Treaty when the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe issued its statement. Kohl relaunched the project in March 1990, immediately after the elections in East Germany that restored democracy and unified Germany. One of the explanations for this continuous involvement is the continuity of leadership in Germany, and, because of that, in Europe. During the first of the two five-year periods the idea of monetary union was conceived and the project formed; then it was endorsed politically and translated into a Treaty; and, finally, that Treaty was ratified. All that occurred in the years 1988 to 1993. The Maastricht Treaty largely follows the German model in terms of the role of the central bank and the aims of economic policy, as well as the idea, strongly advocated by the Germans, that monetary union could only start if a high degree of economic convergence, low inflation, sound public financial conditions, etc. had previously been achieved. People who were in favour of monetary union on the basis of both their economic convictions and their political faith, like myself, tried to explain that it was not indispensable from a conceptual point of view to have so much prior convergence, although convergence was highly desirable per se. In fact, Monetary Union is being launched after five years of preparation during which the most fundamental event was the adjustment of macroeconomic conditions in all countries, and, in particular, in the most divergent countries, including my own. In reference to this preparatory period, I should like to mention only a couple of things. In all European countries, and to some extent even outside Europe, the Maastricht criteria - the pros and cons of which we shall discuss presently -became a benchmark that policy-makers could not ignore, whether or not they favoured Monetary Union and whether or not they intended to join. In many international meetings I have heard the British representative say: \"We comply with Maastricht; the fact that we are not joining Monetary Union does not mean that we are \\'behaving badly\\' in terms of the criteria\". Even the American representative, as I recall on certain occasions, when wishing to convey the message that \"our macroeconomic situation is in order\", would maintain: \"You want to achieve Monetary Union and you don\\'t comply with the criteria, but you should know that we do comply with the criteria\". Thus, these criteria have become an inescapable benchmark.  The second remark which I should like to make in this context is that in these five years a fundamental role was played by financial markets. It must be borne in mind that 10 or 15 years ago the condition of the markets was such that they could not function with the strength and the compelling force which they have enjoyed over the past five years. The Maastricht criteria are laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and would perhaps have been forgotten there, like many previous words of wisdom that can be found in international agreements. What made them compelling was, I think, a combination of two factors. One of these is the fact that the Maastricht Treaty sets a fixed date for the start of Monetary Union, i.e. 1 January 1999. The Treaty states that Monetary Union will start from that date whatever the circumstances, even with only three countries if only three countries were ready. The second factor is the adoption of the convergence criteria by the markets. These two factors together had produced a situation in which every government was constantly being judged by the markets with regard to the probability of its being ready on time for an event that was certain to occur, not subject to further decision. It is fair to say that there have been a few moments in this five-year period in which the possibility of a postponement was discussed. However, this was never agreed, and I should mention that, although people speak very often about EMU being a project of technocrats and bankers, it was the politicians who refused to give serious consideration to postponement. Particularly in Germany, there were moments when Chancellor Kohl was almost the only person to refuse the prospect of postponement. Thus, we have got where we are now after a period of 10 years of continuous work. The basis, however, was a construction, the European Community, that from the very start included and required a form of monetary union, the one that was present in the 1950s.      What is special about EMU?    The second topic on which I should like to touch is what is special about EMU? In a sense, I should answer that nothing is special; it is simply a central bank with a currency, like many others with which we are familiar. However, seen from another angle, EMU brings a number of new elements that I shall briefly recapitulate. New elements in the area of central banking, new elements in the way in which the constitution of economic policy is designed, and also new elements outside the economic sphere, in terms of the way in which Europe functions at the political level. What is new in the field of central banking? The European System of Central Banks, which I shall describe presently, is inspired by the Bundesbank model. Germany has a central bank with a federal structure, like the rest of the German constitution. It is, moreover, somewhat analogous with the Federal Reserve System, which also has a federal structure and is part of a federal political system. The European System of Central Banks is composed of the 15 national central banks of the European Union (the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banca d\\'Italia, the Banque de France, etc.) and, in addition, the European Central Bank. The European Central Bank, which is located in Frankfurt and is the place where I am now working, is similar to the Bundesbank, which is also based in Frankfurt. The national central banks are comparable with the Landeszentralbanken in various Länder or groups of Länder in Germany, or with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., the national central banks being equivalent to the district Federal Reserve Banks (in Boston, New York, Chicago, etc.). There are important differences, however. The national central banks have been - and will remain, for a few weeks or months - fully fledged central banks with the complete range of functions that a central bank usually fulfils. This was not the case with the components of the German or the American system. For this reason, inter alia, they are much stronger institutions; they are located in countries that have their own financial centre and their own national banking system. Therefore, it is much less natural for them to become simply parts of the system than it was for the components of the US or German system, which were designed from the outset as parts of a system. The resources are also very different. The staff of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. comprises around 2,000 to 3,000 persons. We in Frankfurt are less than 500. The European System of Central Banks has unique features in the world of central banking. Compared with other similar central banking systems, the reasons for its coming into being are different, the financial centres through which it will operate are different and the financial techniques which it will employ are different. The Federal Reserve System has one financial centre, which is New York; the European System of Central Banks will operate through Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Milan, Frankfurt, etc. The multiplicity of languages in the euro area is another special feature, because communication has become a key component of the world of central banks. If we go beyond central banking and consider what I previously referred to as the constitution of economic policy, the main novelty is that Monetary Union does not have an ex ante established single fiscal policy (there are some provisos to this which I shall make in a moment). One of the usual two components of the fiscal-cum-monetary policy mix is absent, and monetary policy is operating alone. It is operating, however, in an environment in which most of the legislation and regulation concerning economic activity is also \"federal\" in the sense that it is issued at the Community level. Indeed, there is no significant component of the economic legislation in any of the Member States that is not derived from a Community directive which sets the basic guidelines and principles. Moreover, this Community competence has expanded in recent years to the point of virtually imposing a process of privatisation and deregulation in key sectors of the public utility network that used to be considered to be national monopolies. Indeed the policy competence of the European Union, albeit of a micro nature, is very pervasive. In two other fields of economic policy, the budgetary and the employment fields, the situation is different. In the budgetary field, the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact imply that countries are now committed to achieving budgets which are in balance or close to balance, and either to keeping the public debt ratio below 60% or to decreasing the ratio at a satisfactory speed, if it exceeds the 60% reference level. Thus, Member States no longer have complete freedom in the fiscal field. In American terms, this would be called \"a balanced budget condition in the constitution\"; we adopted such a policy in Europe with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. If a country complies with the Stability and Growth Pact, then it is free to choose the composition and scale of expenditure and taxes it wishes. Thus, the fiscal field is one in which national competence is largely preserved, under a macro constraint stemming from the European Union. As regards employment policy (labour contracts, labour legislation, wage negotiations, etc.), I would say that this is almost entirely national. Moreover, as you will be aware, labour policy in Europe is subject to a high degree of compulsion, owing to the legally binding nature of wage and labour agreements. The social partners have been given the legislative power, regardless of how representative they may be. To sum up, Monetary Union is bringing into existence a European economic constitution in which money is federal, microeconomic legislation is largely federal, labour arrangements are highly regulated but national, and fiscal policy is national with a federal macro constraint. Such a constitution of economic policy is a novelty: I do not think that such a system has ever existed before. The third area in which new elements have emerged concerns European institutions and the way in which they function. The first novelty here is that the process of European unification has reached its culmination in one field, the monetary field. Indeed the \"end of the journey\" had never been reached before in any significant field of competence. The fact that, in a field of prime importance such as the monetary field, the unification process has now been completed, is extremely important, because the outcome of this experience, its success or lack of success, will decisively influence the inclination to take integration to its ultimate conclusion in other fields. Another institutional novelty concerns the way in which participation has been decided. It is indeed the first time that a project of such great importance has been designed in such a way as not to require the participation of all the members of the European Union. The \"ins\" and the \"outs\" are those who, being members of the European Union, respectively do and do not participate in Monetary Union. Arrangements that provide for variable geometry have occasionally been tried in the past, but never in a constitutionally well constructed way. Of course, there are two sides to every coin: in this case, the \"negative\" side is that it admits the possibility of a Member State not participating in a common project, while remaining a member of the European Union; the positive one is that it creates the possibility of pursuing a major new project without being hampered by those members who do not participate. Those who want to advance more quickly have gained the right to do so, even if some other members do not share this intention, and those who lag behind or are unwilling to advance more swiftly have the right not to do so. The constitutionalisation of variably geometry may become a very important factor in the future development of a European Union that will grow from 15 members to 20, 25 or 30, because then the possibility of reaching unanimous agreements involving all the Member States will be much smaller than with a Union of fewer members. An important precedent has thus been set. Another very important institutional novelty is that the key decision-making body of the European Central Bank, which is the Governing Council of the ECB, comprising 17 members (the 11 governors of the participating national central banks and the 6 members of the Executive Board, which is based in Frankfurt), will decide by a majority vote, based on one vote per person, and not use a system of weighted voting. The decision to opt for a \"one person one vote\" rule was, in my view, an extremely important one. Such a rule represents the only way to make sure that the members of the Governing Council will be independent. Moreover, you cannot weight wisdom. It would be just as absurd for a council to decide on the basis of weighted voting in the field of monetary policy, as it would to have weighted voting in a court of justice. A judge is a judge; he or she is not a better judge by virtue of being British rather than Portuguese. From a conceptual point of view this was an obvious choice, but politically it was not. And it is very significant that this choice was accepted rather easily at the time when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated.      What happens on the eve of Monetary Union?    The third and final part of my remarks concerns what happens on the eve of Monetary Union, that is, what is happening now? Generally speaking, we (by \"we\" I mean all the EU national central banks, in particular the 11 participating ones, and the European Central Bank) are frantically working to be ready by 1 January 1999 for the start of Monetary Union. By 1 January there will be no more national monetary policies for the countries of the euro area, no more official national rates, no more national policy operations of various kinds such as open market operations, etc. All that will be part of a single system, in which decisions are taken by the above-mentioned Governing Council, prepared by the Executive Board, comprising the six persons who are in Frankfurt on a full-time basis, and implemented, following the instructions of this Executive Board, in a decentralised manner, whereby most of the operations will be carried out by the national central banks. Getting ready for this total change requires an enormous amount of work. The groundwork for this change had been accomplished to some extent by the predecessor of the European Central Bank, the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which operated in Frankfurt from 1994 to 31 May this year. However, many aspects of the work had to be completed - partly because the EMI and the European Central Bank are very different entities (although they have occupied the same building, are largely composed of the same staff and are headed by the same President, Willem F. Duisenberg). Being now at the ECB myself, and having previously been closely associated with the work of the EMI (I travelled to Frankfurt on at least a monthly basis), I have witnessed this change and realised how important it was to bring it about. During the preparatory phase from the Delors report to the Maastricht Treaty there had been discussions as to whether the European Central Bank should be created at the beginning of what was then called Phase Two, or at the beginning of Phase Three. In the end, it was decided to opt for the latter. I was among those who were strongly in favour of the former, because it seemed to me that the new institution should have been given, from the beginning, the full power to make preparations and decisions in an effective way, although not the power to conduct monetary policy, which was to be reserved for Phase Three only. The European Commission in Brussels - by way of analogy - came into existence with full powers in 1958. Although there was still nothing established, the Commission had the power to implement the Treaty of Rome. Well, for Monetary Union, it was decided otherwise, and the EMI was a weak institution. It had no powers to take legally binding decisions or to issue regulations, nor did it have the power to impose anything. Unanimous decisions are very difficult to reach. The EMI worked on the basis of seeking to achieve a de facto consensus that was close to unanimity. It was very difficult to agree on anything if one or two of the larger national central banks were in disagreement. Moreover, the EMI worked with 15 national central banks, thus disregarding any distinction between the \"ins\" and \"outs\". All that has now changed; we have majority votes; we are a group of 11 (not 15) countries; we have the legal power to impose decisions; the key decision-making body, i.e. the Governing Council, includes six members of the Executive Board. There is now an enormous amount of work that consists in formalising the preparations that were conducted during the lifetime of the European Monetary Institute, in making choices where important issues had been left unresolved, in adapting certain tentative arrangements that had been decisively influenced by, for example, the Bank of England, which is no longer represented on the main decision-making body. On this latter point, it should be remembered that those who are represented on the decision-making body have, of course, the duty and the liberty to take the decisions that they consider optimal for the success of Monetary Union, and not necessarily for the \"outs\". Accomplishing the transition from the EMI to the ECB, and learning to function within the new institutional system is the common denominator of much of the work currently being undertaken at the ECB . Of course, the work which is being accomplished concerns central bank activities. I should like to offer you a few examples, such as monetary policy design, the implementation of monetary policy decisions, international relations and the way in which communications will be organised. In each of these fields, new approaches have to be found because, as I mentioned earlier, the ESCB is in so many respects a unique construction. As regards monetary policy design, the fundamental point is that monetary policy will have to be designed on the basis of an assessment of the economic situation of the so-called euro area (sometimes referred to as \"Euroland\"), i.e. of the area comprising the 11 participating Member States, and not on the basis of an exercise in comparative economics across 11 individual countries. We shall look at the price developments for the whole area. We shall consider the economic situation and the cyclical conditions in the same way. Allow me to offer you an image: it is like having, not a political map, but rather an economic map, in which there are no borders and only a \"natural\" description of the landscape. If you look at an economic map of Europe, based on many types of indicators, it is extremely difficult, I would even say impossible, to trace the political borders. In such a map no one would be able to separate Belgium from the Netherlands, the North of Italy from the South of Germany, etc. Well, the economic assessment on the basis of which policy will be designed has to be made on an economic map, which causes enormous problems for statistical data, forecasting instruments, etc. No less difficult are the problems of policy implementation. Implementation will have to be conducted through 11 financial centres, of which perhaps one half could be considered major. Each of these centres is today both a policy and a financial centre which employs different techniques and practices from those which will apply in the single money market as from 1 January 1999. As an example of the problems arising in the area of international relations, I should like to refer to participation in the International Monetary Fund. Note that it is called the International Monetary Fund, because the monetary aspect is crucial. However, the emergence of a European Central Bank does not easily fit into the IMF structure, given that the members of the IMF are countries. The assumption implicit in the Articles of Agreement is that countries are also the relevant policy-makers. With the ECB, however, we have a policy-maker, for monetary policy, which is not a country. No individual country can represent the monetary policy of Europe, i.e. the monetary policy of the second most important economic entity in the world, and of what will be a key reserve currency in international relations. As the Fund is structured at present, there is simply no provision for a reality like EMU. The founders of the Fund could not imagine that one day there would be such a thing as a European Central Bank without a European state, a European government, etc. Thus, we are now studying how best to be represented in the International Monetary Fund, notwithstanding this anomaly. A final area which I should like to mention is communication. Communication has become a fundamental part of monetary policy in two respects: in the way central banks impart information to the markets, thereby influencing expectations, and in the way they communicate with the public, thereby cultivating support for their actions. It is no simple task to provide consistent and simultaneous communication in 11 different languages. It is not only a matter of accuracy in the translation. Very often you can accurately translate a sentence from one language into another, but the way that sentence reads is not the same because the conventions governing usage may be very different, so that what you say is understood in a different way.      Conclusion    Well, I think I should stop here. Five years of negotiation, five years of preparation. Monetary Union will start in four months less two days. Much preparatory work has been undertaken and many thoughts have been developed. Yet it is very difficult to predict precisely what will happen. I am convinced that powerful factors will make the euro a stable and reliable currency. However, it is hard to predict where the difficulties will lie. There is a well-known tendency of strategists to prepare for the next war on the basis of the study of the past wars, and then one discovers that each war is different from the preceding ones. The problems that have preoccupied central banks in the past 20 years may not be the same problems that will concern them most in the years to come. The system will have to cope with new situations, and this will make the implementation at least as stimulating as the two phases which are now reaching their conclusion. Thank you.      Bertram Schefold:    Well, thank you very much for a brilliant lecture of admirable clarity. I hope the organiser will not be held responsible for the rain. We now have a unique opportunity to ask questions.  ']\n",
      "['1998-07-15', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Presentation of the EMI annual report to the European Parliament', 'Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank/former President of the EMI, 15 July 1998', '  Presentation of the EMI annual report to the European Parliament   Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank/former President of the EMI, 15 July 1998 It gives me great pleasure to be able to present to the European Parliament the 1997 Annual Report of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). This was the fourth, and last, such publication by the EMI before it made way for the European Central Bank (ECB), which was established on 1 June 1998. I want to take this opportunity to review the preparations for European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) leading up to the start of Stage Three on 1 January next year.      Preparatory work    Preparatory work for Stage Three proceeded as planned in 1997. Since the start of 1994 the EMI, in close collaboration with the national central banks of the European Union, has undertaken the necessary technical preparations for the establishment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), the conduct of the single monetary policy and the creation of the single currency. These tasks will be completed by its successor, the ECB. Increasingly, the work undertaken has been of a more technical nature as the various preparations have drawn closer to completion. As in past years, the Annual Report described the activities of the EMI in a broad range of areas. Let me highlight the following:    The EMI published a report on monetary policy strategy in February 1997, identifying two potential strategies for Stage Three: intermediate monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. However, it also highlighted that, irrespective of the final choice, there was a need for a clear definition of the objective of price stability and for specific targets against which the performance of the ESCB could be assessed; for a broad range of indicator variables to help assess risks to price stability (with a prominent role assigned to monetary aggregates); and for various tools for forecasting inflation and other key variables. Following this report, the EMI concentrated on developing the infrastructure necessary to support monetary policy decision-making, including developing a number of econometric tools for preparing policy decisions, such as an area-wide macroeconomic model and, in conjunction with national central banks (NCBs), a multi-country model.   The conceptual phase of preparatory work dealing with monetary policy instruments and procedures was concluded at the end of 1996, leading to publication in January 1997 of the so-called Framework Report (the full title is \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three – specification of the operational framework\"). The first half of 1997 was then devoted to defining the technical specifications for the ESCB’s operational framework, enabling the publication in September 1997 of a further report, entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three – General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\". Progress in terms of the technical features of monetary policy operation in 1997 related mainly to the procedures, time frame and calendar for ESCB tenders; to the settlement modalities of open market operations; and to the implications of the end-of-day procedures for the use of standing facilities. The EMI also carried out other preparatory work in this field, such as that on minimum reserve requirements, defining common eligibility criteria for monetary policy counterparties and eligible assets and setting up an effective liquidity management system.   In the area of foreign exchange policy, the European Council meeting in Amsterdam in June last year approved a resolution relating to the new exchange rate mechanism to be introduced in Stage Three, ERM II. The EMI finalised a draft agreement between the ECB and future non-euro area NCBs setting out the operating procedure, to be submitted to the ECB for endorsement. It continued work on the technical infrastructure to enable the system to operate from 1 January 1999. Implementation work was conducted to enable the ECB to execute foreign exchange intervention, focusing on the operational framework and information systems support. Likewise, work has been undertaken on transferring foreign reserve assets to the ECB at the start of Stage Three. Two draft proposals for a monitoring framework were prepared by the EMI; one on operations conducted by NCBs and another on transactions made by Member States. The EMI also conducted work on procedures for the computation and publication of reference exchange rates for the euro. And, as you will recall, it was possible in May of this year, following a decision by the European Council in Luxembourg last December, to pre-announce the bilateral rates of the currencies participating in the euro area.   As regards statistical preparations, work has focused on implementing and making more detailed the wide-ranging statistical requirements for Stage Three. For example, in 1997 the EMI published a provisional list (subsequently revised) of institutions forming the Monetary and Financial Institutions (MFI) sector; an addendum was released in December covering money market funds. It also published documents on money and banking and balance of payments statistics and work has begun with EUROSTAT on quarterly financial accounts.   In the field of payment systems, in September 1997 the EMI released a \"Second progress report\" on TARGET, addressing issues such as the operating time, pricing policies, provision of intraday liquidity to non-euro area NCBs and the role of the ECB in TARGET. Testing and implementation of TARGET is under way to enable this to be fully operational by late December. Both static and dynamic testing, and multilateral tests, have been completed and simulation tests are now being conducted under conditions as close to the future live environment as possible. In addition, the standards and underlying analysis for the use of Securities Settlements Systems were published in early January.   Preparation of euro banknotes has continued. In the course of 1997 final designs were developed from the draft designs which were chosen by the EMI Council in December 1996. Illustrations of the revised designs were published in July 1997. These designs have been transformed into printing plates in the first half of 1998. In order to ensure a smooth production of the euro banknotes, prototypes of the euro banknotes were manufactured in 1997 by eight different paper mills and ten different printing works. This project revealed that all the participating printing works should be in a position to produce all the euro banknote denominations to an equal standard of quality and with an identical appearance. Mass production of the euro banknotes will start in early 1999.   Finally, the EMI was actively involved in 1997 with other aspects of the changeover to the euro. To cite just a few examples, the EMI met with representatives of EU-wide banking and financial associations to discuss issues such as the replacement in contracts of price references that may lose their significance after the start of Stage Three and the replacement of existing interbank rates. Following encouragement given by the EMI to banking associations and money and foreign exchange markets to engage in the collective definition of euro area indicators, the Banking Federation of the European Union and the Financial Markets Association (the professional association of foreign exchange market dealers) announced the intention to compute and publish a euro area-wide indicator of interbank rates, to be called EURIBOR.         Composition of the euro area and establishment of the ESCB    The initial composition of the euro area from 1 January 1999 onwards was decided in early May. The Annual Report briefly described the main characteristics of the euro area, based on available information. There is still much work to be done in the remaining six months or so before the start of Stage Three. I began today by recalling that the establishment of the ECB and the ESCB took place barely six weeks ago, on 1 June 1998. Since then, we have been busy carrying forward the preparations for Stage Three. Both the General Council and the Governing Council have met, the latter twice. In its meetings so far, the ECB has been concerned with many organisational issues, such as the allocation by the Executive Board of responsibilities among its members and giving us a new structure which suits the tasks of the ECB. It has, for example, agreed on the Rules of Procedure of the ECB, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. And it has approved the establishment of eleven ESCB committees to assist in the work of the ECB. In terms of the preparatory work, at its first meeting the Governing Council agreed on the method to be applied for determining the NCBs’ percentage shares in the key for the ECB’s capital and the measures necessary for the paying up of the capital of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of slightly under EUR 4 billion at the start of July. The Governing Council also agreed on the framework for the organisation of the overall testing of ESCB-wide systems and procedures which will be conducted in the remaining six months before 1 January 1999. It also dealt with two specific issues relating to preparations for Stage Three: relating to TARGET and euro banknotes. On the former, a pricing policy was agreed. The main element of this is that a degressive tariff will be applied to payment transactions flowing through this system. Concerning the latter, it has been agreed that the initial supply of banknotes for the euro area should be produced largely following a decentralised approach, i.e. each of the eleven participating NCBs will be able to organise the production of euro banknotes needed to replace their national banknotes, either producing the relevant banknotes themselves or entering into bilateral pooling arrangements. The second meeting of the Governing Council took place on Tuesday last week. The Governing Council decided on the introduction of a minimum reserve system. Among the functions that such a system can usefully perform, the contribution that it can make to stabilising money market interest rates and increasing the demand for central bank money by creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the market was considered by the Council to be particularly important. However, the Council also considered very carefully the implications of such a system for the banking sector. With this in mind, it decided that the minimum reserve holdings would be remunerated at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations. The exact specification of the minimum reserve system, including the reserve ratio (which is currently defined within a range of 1.5-2.5%), will be decided by November 1998 at the latest.  A decision was also taken on the size and form of the initial transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB from participating NCBs. Without going into the details, the transfer amounts to around EUR 39.5 billion. The conditions for participation of non-euro area EU central banks and credit institutions in the TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer) system were also decided, taking into account the risks to the conduct of monetary policy that giving unlimited access to intraday credit to such institutions outside the euro area could bring. Therefore, non-euro area EU central banks will be able to provide collateralised intraday credit in euro to their credit institutions, but subject to a ceiling both at the level of the non-euro area EU central banks and at that of non-euro area credit institutions. There will also be a liquidity deadline, set at 5 p.m., for non-euro area credit institutions so that they do not incur an overnight overdraft in euro. The Council agreed on a number of legal instruments aimed at enhancing the protection of euro banknotes. Finally, the Governing Council has adopted a number of ECB Recommendations for EU Council Regulations concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB, the application of minimum reserves, and the powers of the ECB to impose sanctions. I would like to draw your attention to the Recommendation on statistics. This is of particular importance to the ECB because it will need to base its decisions on euro area-wide statistics, particularly, in this context, monetary and balance of payments statistics, which will be provided under this framework legislation. An ECB Regulation specifying in detail the actual reporting population and the statistical information which reporting institutions will be required to provide cannot be issued until the Council Regulation is enacted. These requirements have already been discussed over a considerable period of time, but a legal instrument will provide the necessary certainty to those who must meet them. There will be an opportunity for the ECOFIN Council to adopt the relevant text at its meeting in October. This would mean that we would appreciate it if the European Parliament could deliver an Opinion in the course of September.      Concluding remarks    To conclude, in my view, the thorough technical preparation carried out by the EMI during 1997, and in earlier years, enables us to look forward with confidence to the introduction of the single currency at the beginning of next year. This preparatory work is now being brought to completion by the ECB and the ESCB. However, the solid foundations which have been laid by the EMI should help the ECB and the ESCB to develop into a credible and powerful institution which will pursue its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area in a determined manner. This, in turn, will provide the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth. The improvement in the economic situation in the EU seen last year, and which is expected to continue in 1998, may be considered to provide a very satisfactory starting-point for Monetary Union. However, Member States’ fiscal policies now need to be geared towards achieving the medium-term requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact as soon as possible. The benchmark for fiscal policies is clearly to achieve a budget which is in balance or in surplus – a surplus is needed especially for those countries with high debt to GDP ratios.  ']\n",

Aspectos functionales e institutionales   Principales puntos de la intervención de Eugenio Domingo Solans en el Curso de Verano de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid Aguadulce (Almería), 9 de julio de 1998 La principal decisión que deberá tomar próximamente el Banco Central Europeo (BCE) es la relativa a la estrategia más adecuada de política monetaria. Una estrategia combinada de objetivos directos de inflación con objetivos intermedios monetarios parece la opción más recomendable, al menos al inicio de la tercera fase de la UEM. La estabilidad de la demanda de dinero en el conjunto del área euro es el elemento clave para ponderar el grado de aplicación de una u otra estrategia. En el plano funcional, la decisión más relevante adoptada hasta ahora por el BCE es la de aplicar un coeficiente de caja a las instituciones bancarias. El coeficiente de caja mejora el funcionamiento de la política monetaria al estabilizar los tipos de interés del mercado monetario, tensar la liquidez y aumentar la elasticidad de la demanda de dinero con respecto al tipo de interés. Su nivel se situará entre el 1,5% y el 2,5% de la base computable, se admitirá una deducción del orden de 100.000 EUR y se retribuirá en correspondencia con el tipo de interés de las principales operaciones de refinanciación del BCE. En el plano institucional, el elemento básico para el éxito del BCE es la independencia. Dicha independencia es como un poliedro compuesto de diversos planos: el institucional funcional, el del régimen de los órganos de gobierno, el financiero, el personal. Independencia no es aislamiento, ni falta de transparencia, ni ausencia de rendición de cuentas. Transparencia, comunicación, rendición de cuentas, aparte de requisitos de responsabilidad democrática, constituyen factores que coadyuvan a la efectividad de las medidas de política monetaria al posibilitar una mejor comprensión por parte del público y de los mercados. La independencia, la adopción de una perspectiva europea y, sobre todo, una actuación encaminada inequívocamente a la estabilidad es clave para que el BCE adquiera credibilidad entre los ciudadanos de la Unión Europea.

      "['1998-07-08', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'ECB Press conference: Introductory statement', 'Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank', '  ECB Press conference: Introductory statement   Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of the second meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held yesterday.  The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation.  Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May.  Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.  The favourable conjunctural situation has started to feed through into the labour market, although improvements here have in some countries been too slow to appear. It is evident, however, that economic growth alone will not reduce the urgency to proceed with structural adjustments in order to tackle unacceptably high rates of unemployment.  As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply (M3H) accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% in March. The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%. We shall monitor these developments very carefully.  In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides a favourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation. It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued.  In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects. First, any \"growth dividend\" resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debt levels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure. Second, most Member States need to go a step further, and indeed improve structural balances as they are not yet in compliance with the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact. This implies that the benchmark for fiscal policy must now be a budget close to balance or in surplus - in surplus especially in countries with high ratios of debt to GDP. Third, further structural adjustments in fiscal policy would also help to improve the policy mix in some countries and in the euro area as a whole from the start of Stage Three.  I would not at the present time want to try to convey too strong an impression of the implications of these various economic developments for the appropriate stance of monetary policies in euro area Member States. Although the responsibility for these policies remains with national central banks until the end of this year, the Governing Council had an extensive and thorough discussion on a euro area perspective of monetary policy. We will continue to study this issue closely before we enter the regime of a single monetary policy. For the time being, it is encouraging to see the credibility of monetary policy being reflected in the exchange rates of euro countries. There is currently no sign of exchange rate tensions among euro area currencies. Forward exchange rates are expected to be virtually identical to central rates, suggesting that the pre-announced rates are considered credible. I consider this a remarkable achievement.  Following its review of economic developments, the Governing Council settled a number of organisational issues.  (i) It adopted the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank. These will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;  (ii) It approved, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the establishment of eleven ESCB committees to assist in the work of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The committees are as follows (listed in alphabetical order): Accounting and Monetary Income Committee, Banking Supervision Committee, Banknote Committee, External Communications Committee, Information Technology Committee, Internal Auditors Committee, Legal Committee, Market Operations Committee, Monetary Policy Committee, Payment and Settlement Systems Committee, and Statistics Committee;  (iii) It formally adopted a budget for the European Central Bank for the second half of 1998 and agreed on the establishment of a Budget Committee to assist the Governing Council in ECB budget-related matters;  (iv) It laid down specific rules applicable to staff transferring from the European Monetary  Institute to the European Central Bank. ECB Decisions relating to the Conditions of Employment will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  The Governing Council also took a number of decisions relating to various aspects of its preparatory work for Stage Three.    (a) Monetary policy issues   The Governing Council decided on the introduction of a minimum reserve system by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three. Among the three main functions that a minimum reserve system could usefully perform, the Governing Council attaches particularly high importance to its contributions to the stabilisation of money market interest rates and to the enlargement of the demand for central bank money by creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the market.  In the light of the potential burden which a minimum reserve system could impose on the private sector and the effects it might have on the financial activity of credit institutions in the euro area, the Governing Council has decided on features which fulfil the two money market management purposes outlined above, while at the same time allowing an adequate remuneration of minimum reserves.  A number of details of the minimum reserve system that will be applied were already specified in previous documents published by the European Monetary Institute. Additional features agreed upon yesterday include the liability base, the lump-sum allowance and the rate of remuneration. With regard to the latter, the ECB will remunerate minimum reserve holdings at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations. The Governing Council intends to decide on the exact specification of the minimum reserve system in November 1998 at the latest. This decision, in particular as regards the reserve ratio (which is currently defined within a range of 1.5% - 2.5%), will be based on the early data from the new system for money and banking statistics.  Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.  It is intended that the precise features of the minimum reserve system will be published in the form of an EU Council Regulation. For this purpose, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Recommendation for an EU Council Regulation on the application of minimum  reserves by the European Central Bank. In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, the EU Council, acting by a qualified majority and after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, is expected to adopt this Regulation.  The Governing Council also adopted ECB Recommendations for EU Council Regulations concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB and concerning the powers of  the ECB to impose sanctions. All three ECB Recommendations will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for general notice.    (b) Foreign exchange issues   The Governing Council decided on the size and form of the initial transfer of foreign reserve assets to the European Central Bank from the national central banks participating in the euro area. This transfer is to take place on the first day of 1999. It has been decided that the initial transfer will be to the maximum allowed amount of EUR 50 billion, adjusted downwards by deducting the shares in the ECB\\'s capital subscription key of the EU central banks which will not participate in the euro area at the outset. The transfer will thus be equal to 78.9153% of EUR 50 billion, i.e. approximately EUR 39.46 billion.  The Governing Council furthermore agreed that this initial transfer should be in gold in an amount equivalent to 15% of the sum I have just mentioned, with the remaining 85% being transferred in foreign currency assets. I should stress that the decision on the percentage of gold to be transferred to the ECB will have no implications for the consolidated gold holdings of the ESCB.  The precise modalities of the initial transfer will be finalised before the end of the year.  Before the end of the current year the Governing Council will also have to adopt an ECB Guideline pursuant to Article 31.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which will subject all operations in foreign reserve assets remaining with the national central banks - including gold - to approval by the ECB.  In connection with the setting-up of common market standards, the Governing Council also reached agreement on a number of issues related to the quotation and publication of reference exchange rates for the euro. Specifically, it was agreed to recommend to market participants the \"certain\" method for quoting the exchange rates for the euro (i.e. 1 euro = X foreign currency units) and to have daily reference exchange rates for the euro computed and published by the ECB.  Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.    (c)   Payment systems issues   The Governing Council decided on the conditions for the participation of the non-euro area EU central banks and credit institutions in the TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real\\xadtime Gross settlement Express Transfer) system. In TARGET the ESCB will provide central bank liquidity in the course of the day (i.e. intraday liquidity) to the extent necessary to avoid delays in the execution of payment orders. If intraday liquidity is not reimbursed at the end of the day it becomes overnight credit granted by the ESCB, which, for evident monetary policy reasons, cannot be offered to institutions outside the euro area. Nonetheless, non-euro area EU central banks and institutions in those countries will be connected to TARGET.  The Governing Council considered that giving such institutions outside the euro area unlimited access to intraday credit would have created risks for the conduct of monetary policy that it was not ready to take. A facility will therefore be put in place to enable the non-euro area EU central banks to provide collateralised intraday credit in euro to their credit institutions, subject to a ceiling both at the level of the non-euro area EU central banks and at that of non-euro area credit institutions. There will also be a liquidity deadline, set at 5 p.m. , for non-euro area credit institutions so that they do not incur an overnight overdraft in euro.  Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.  The Governing Council also agreed that a report on recent developments in the field of electronic money - and their monetary policy implications - would be published in September 1998.    (d)   Legal protection of euro banknotes   Finally, the Governing Council agreed on a number of legal instruments aimed at enhancing the protection of euro banknotes. In particular, an ECB Decision on the denominations,  specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of banknotes has been adopted, as well as an ECB Recommendation regarding the adoption of certain measures to enhance the  legal protection of euro banknotes and coins. Both documents will be published for general information in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.  We are at your disposal for further questions.   ']\n",

Die Konstanzer Fakultät genießt einen Ruf, der weit über die Grenzen Deutschlands hinausreicht. Mit der Würde des Ehrendoktors lassen Sie mich am Glanz dieses Rufes teilhaben, dafür schulde ich Ihnen tiefen Dank. Als ich mich 1990 entschloß, meinen Lehrstuhl, die Zugehörigkeit zum Sachverständigenrat und manche andere akademische Bindung aufzugeben und zur Bundesbank zu wechseln, geschah dies mit großem innerlichen Vorbehalt, verließ ich doch die Welt, der ich mich zugehörig fühlte, in der ich mich zu Hause wußte und aus der mich nichts, aber auch gar nichts anderes hätte fortlocken können. Von daher mögen Sie verstehen, was es mir bedeutet, von der Wissenschaft nicht vergessen zu sein. Schließlich sehe ich selbst meine wichtigste Aufgabe darin, einen Beitrag zu leisten, die praktische Geldpolitik wissenschaftlich zu fundieren. Hier die Wissenschaft, deren unersättliche Neugier immer neue Fragen aufwirft, ewig nach den richtigen Antworten suchend - dort der Zwang der Politik, täglich neu zu entscheiden, noch bevor die letzte Sicherheit gefunden ist. Über diese Kluft eine Brücke zu schlagen, die gleicherweise den Stürmen der Realität standhält und theoretischen Ansprüchen genügt, ist und bleibt für mich ständige Herausforderung. Statt: Von der D-Mark zum Euro, hätte ich auch den Titel wählen können: Von der Bundesbank zur Europäischen Zentralbank - oder vielleicht gar: Von einem, der auszog, das Fürchten zu lernen? Furcht ist es nicht gerade, aber doch gehöriger Respekt vor dem neuen Amt. An der Gestaltung einer Währung mitzuwirken, die es beim Amtsantritt noch gar nicht gibt, ist wohl die faszinierendste Aufgabe, die einem Ökonomen gestellt werden kann. Mit reiner Phantasie wäre man wohl kaum darauf verfallen; die Realität erweist sich wieder einmal als stärker.   50 Jahre D-Mark   Wie nahe manchmal historische Ereignisse zeitlich beieinander liegen. Am 20. Juni dieses Jahres haben wir in der Paulskirche den 50. Geburtstag der D-Mark gefeiert. Zehn Tage später und einige Häuserblocks weiter fand die Feier zur Inauguration der Europäischen Zentralbank statt, die das Ende der D-Mark ankündigt. Mit dem 1. Januar 1999 verliert die D-Mark den Status als eigenständige Währung, sie wird von diesem Zeitpunkt an nur noch Repräsentant der neuen Währung Euro sein. Ab dem Jahr 2002 wird sie schließlich ganz aus dem Verkehr verschwunden sein. Dieser Vorgang wird in Deutschland als tiefer Einschnitt empfunden. Offenbar fällt den Deutschen der Abschied von ihrer Währung sehr schwer. Das war bei ihren Vorgängerinnen, die beide ein schmähliches Ende erfuhren, gewiß nicht der Fall. Die Mark - erste einheitliche Währung auf deutschem Boden seit den Zeiten des römischen Denars - ging in der Hyperinflation des Jahres 1923 unter. Ihrer Nachfolgerin, der Reichsmark, war gerade einmal die halbe Lebenszeit beschieden. 50 - 25 - 50 Jahre - eine merkwürdige Sequenz in der Geschichte der deutschen Währungen. Zweimal in einer Generation hatten die Deutschen also den Untergang ihrer Währung und die Zerstörung des Geldvermögens erfahren. Den Wunsch nach stabilen Geld aus der Erfahrung mit dem vom Staat inszenierten inflationären Betrug mag man den Worten Stefan Zweigs in seinem Werk \"Die Welt von Gestern\" entnehmen, aus dem Kontrast der Verhältnisse im vorangegangenen \"goldenen Zeitalter der Sicherheit\" und dem Chaos der Inflation. \"Es lohnte sich\" - schreibt er über die Zeit vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg - \"Geld Jahr für Jahr in sicheren Anlagen zu investieren. Noch wurde nicht wie in Zeiten der Inflation der Sparsame bestohlen, der Solide geprellt, und gerade die Geduldigsten, die Nichtspekulanten hatten den besten Gewinn. \" Und im Kontrast dazu: \"Nichts hat das deutsche Volk - dies muß immer wieder ins Gedächtnis gerufen werden - so erbittert, so haßwütig, so hitlerreif gemacht wie die Inflation.\" Nach diesen Erfahrungen, und der Wiederholung unter anderen Vorzeichen 1948, ist die im Ausland oft bespöttelte, beinahe emotionale Bindung der Deutschen an ihre Währung kaum mehr verwunderlich. Die D-Mark wurde zum Symbol für wirtschaftlichen Aufstieg und internationale Anerkennung. Die Deutschen haben dies bei ihren Reisen ins Ausland sehr bald persönlich erfahren - ihre Währung, die D-Mark, jedenfalls war überall geschätzt. Zumindest instinktiv dürfte dabei auch der Zusammenhang zwischen Geld und einer wichtigen Form der Freiheit ins Bewußtsein gedrungen sein: Konvertibilität der Währung bildet die materielle Grundlage für die Reisefreiheit über die Landesgrenzen hinweg. Nicht von ungefähr haben Diktaturen zu allen Zeiten das Mittel der Devisenbeschaffung nicht nur zum Schutz des Außenwertes ihrer Währung eingesetzt. Drakonische Strafen für \"Devisenschiebereien\" können als beredter Ausdruck des totalitären Anspruchs des Regimes auf Leib und Leben seiner Bürger dienen. Auch aus dieser Erfahrung erklärt sich das 1989 in den Straßen Leipzigs dokumentierte Verlangen nach der D-Mark.   Der Euro und die EZB   Und jetzt der Euro - der nach allen Umfragen in Deutschland hartnäckig auf Ablehnung stößt. Eine Einschätzung vorweg: Innere Reserven gegenüber der neuen Währung könnten noch eine Weile anhalten, die Deutschen werden sich jedoch in ihrer großen Mehrheit rasch mit der unwiderruflichen Tatsache Euro abfinden, aber sehr kritisch den weiteren Fortgang beobachten. Mit seiner Stabilität wird dann aber auch der Euro das Vertrauen der Bürger gewinnen. Die Vorgänge am ersten Maiwochenende haben \\xad um es sehr milde auszudrücken \\xad dazu gewiß nicht beigetragen. Ich bin mir allerdings ziemlich sicher, daß diese Vorgänge die Position des Direktoriums der Europäischen Zentralbank eher gestärkt denn geschwächt haben. Das Echo auf dieses Gezerre, beinahe unisono quer durch Europa, zeigt den allgemeinen Überdruß an politischen Händeln dieser Art und war gleichzeitig beredter Ausdruck des Wunsches nach einer von politischen Einflüssen unabhängigen Notenbank. In der Anhörung vor dem Europäischen Parlament haben im übrigen alle vom Europäischen Rat benannten Personen nicht den geringsten Zweifel aufkommen lassen, daß sie ihr Mandat im Sinne des Vertrages unabhängig ausüben werden. Das Statut der EZB enthält alle institutionellen Voraussetzungen für eine auf gutes Geld gerichtete Politik. Der Souverän hat mit dem Vorrang für Preisstabilität das Ziel vorgegeben, jetzt ist es an den Verantwortlichen, alles in ihrer Macht stehende zu tun, um dieser Vorgabe gerecht zu werden. Die Unabhängigkeit ist nicht Selbstzweck, sondern Mittel, um das von der Legislative gesetzte Ziel zu erreichen. Das Statut verleiht mit der Unabhängigkeit - und der Klausel, daß eine Wiederernennung ausgeschlossen ist, - den notwendigen Rückhalt. Im Januar 1999 erleben wir eine Premiere. Noch niemals in der Geschichte der Menschheit haben unabhängige Staaten ihre Währungen abgeschafft, ihre geldpolitische Souveränität aufgegeben und auf eine gemeinsame, supranationale Institution übertragen. Dieser Vorgang ist um so bemerkenswerter, als nicht Wertverlust zum Untergang der nationalen Währungen führt, sondern ganz im Gegenteil der Nachweis der Stabilität quasi als Eintrittsbillet in die Währungsunion verlangt wird. Wer hätte es noch vor wenigen Jahren für möglich gehalten, daß die durchschnittliche Inflationsrate der Mitgliedstaaten der Währungsunion kurz vor Beginn in der Nähe von 11/2 % liegen könnte und Deutschland mit seiner Preissteigerungsrate gerade einmal im Mittelfeld zu finden ist? Auch von daher scheint das Feld für den Start wohl bestellt. Als neue Institution kann die Europäische Zentralbank sich jedoch nicht auf die Reputation verlassen, die in der Vergangenheit im steten Ringen um Stabilität und insbesondere in schwierigen Situationen, nicht zuletzt auch Konflikten mit der Politik gewonnen wurde, die, durchaus verständlich, unter drohenden Wahlterminen bereit ist und darauf drängt, es vorübergehend - und das ganze Leben gleicht einer Kette vorübergehender Episoden - mit der Geldwertstabilität nicht gar zu ernst zu nehmen. Gleichwohl beginnt die Bewährungsprobe mit der ersten Stunde. Die Öffentlichkeit wird die Europäische Zentralbank von Anfang an kritisch beobachten. Vor allem die internationalen Finanzmärkte werden jede ihrer Entscheidungen mit Argusaugen verfolgen. Es gilt daher, schon im Vorfeld alles zu unternehmen, um der Währungsunion zu einem erfolgreichen Start zu verhelfen. In den wenigen verbleibenden Monaten dieses Jahres steht eine Fülle wichtiger Entscheidungen an. So gilt es, die Strategie zu bestimmen, mit der wir unsere Aufgabe angehen. Die Diskussion im Rahmen des Europäischen Währungsinstituts hat die wirkliche Option auf die Alternativen Geldmengenziel und direktes Inflationsziel oder Kombinationen aus deren Elementen reduziert. Sowohl im Interesse der von vielen Seiten angemahnten Rechenschaftspflicht als auch im Sinne einer Selbstverpflichtung muß die Europäische Zentralbank ihre Strategie festlegen und der Öffentlichkeit gegenüber überzeugend erklären. Der tatsächliche Erfolg der EZB im Hinblick auf das Endziel Preisstabilität wird sich frühestens nach ein bis zwei Jahren, eigentlich jedoch erst über mehrere Konjukturzyklen hinweg, überprüfen lassen. In dieser Situation könnte die Vorgabe eines Zwischenziels entscheidend dazu beitragen, die Inflationserwartungen des privaten Sektors auf dem angestrebten niedrigen Niveau zu verankern. Andererseits wird gerade in der Anfangsphase der Währungsunion die Unsicherheit über die Wirkungsbeziehungen zwischen den geldpolitischen Instrumenten, dem gewählten (gleich welchem) Zwischenziel und dem Endziel Preisstabilität besonders hoch sein. Aus meiner Sicht empfiehlt es sich deshalb, die Geldmengensteuerung um eine umfassende Analyse der künftigen Preisentwicklung zu ergänzen. Das Spektrum der anstehenden Entscheidungen vor Beginn der Währungsunion ist in der Fülle der technischen Details kaum noch zu überblicken, es reicht von der statistischen Erfassung der Geldmenge bis zum Druck der Banknoten. Vor allem gilt es endgültig festzulegen, mit welchem Instrumentarium die EZB ihre Geldpolitik durchführen wird. Auch wenn hier noch ein horrendes Ausmaß an Arbeit wartet und die eine oder andere Panne nicht auszuschließen ist, bin ich doch zuversichtlich, daß wir die Vorbereitungen rechtzeitig abschließen werden. Die neue Institution EZB steht auf dem Fundament eines stabilitätsorientierten Statuts, die Geldpolitik wird zum Start wohl gerüstet sein. Sind also alle bisher geäußerten Sorgen grundlos, wird die Währungsunion gleichsam zum Selbstläufer? Die Politik selbst schlägt inzwischen vorsichtigere Töne an. Der französische Staatspräsident hat vor kurzem von einem \"großen kollektiven Abenteuer\" gesprochen. Nun, diesen Ausdruck würde ich nicht verwenden, Notenbanker neigen nun einmal nicht zu Abenteuern. Als Experiment ohne historisches Vorbild bleibt die Währungsunion jedoch allemal ein Unternehmen mit Chancen und Risiken. Vor dem Euro muß niemandem bange sein, die Chancen stehen mehr als gut, daß er sich zu einer im Innern stabilen und von außen anerkannten Währung entwickeln wird. Allerdings sollten auch die Risiken nicht verschwiegen werden. Diese sind vorwiegend außerhalb der rein monetären Sphäre auszumachen. Mit der erschreckend hohen Zahl von rund 15 Millionen Arbeitslosen bringen die 11 Mitgliedstaaten eine bedrückende Hypothek in die Währungsunion ein. Die daraus drohenden Gefährdungen für die Geldpolitik liegen auf der Hand. Grundlegende Reformen des Arbeitsmarktes werden nicht zuletzt von internationalen Organisationen wie dem IMF und der OECD seit langem angemahnt, mit dem Beginn der Währungsunion werden sie geradezu lebensnotwendig für die Zukunft der Gemeinschaft und ihrer Mitgliedstaaten. Bahnbrechende Deregulierungen der Gütermärkte sowie vor allem durch Einsparungen bei den konsumptiven Staatsausgaben finanzierte Steuer- und Abgabensenkungen sind die unentbehrliche komplementäre Ergänzung. Mit der Finanzpolitik ist ein weiterer Gefahrenherd für das reibungslose Funktionieren der Währungsunion auszumachen. Zu recht hat der Bundesfinanzminister mit dem Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt einen weiteren Pfeiler der Stabilität gefordert und durchgesetzt. Unmittelbar nach der Entscheidung über die Teilnehmerländer sind freilich schon die ersten Aufweichungserscheinungen auszumachen. Am 1. Mai dieses Jahres hat der ECOFIN Rat noch erklärt, daß die Mitgliedsländer ihre budgetären Konsolidierungsanstrengungen verstärken werden, wenn die Wirtschaftsentwicklung besser als bis dahin angenommen verlaufen sollte. Inzwischen zeichnet sich ab, daß sich trotz günstiger Wirtschaftsdaten das tatsächliche Defizit kaum verringern wird, der Wert für das konjunkturbereinigte Defizit also steigt. Es verheißt nichts gutes, wenn die EU-Kommission für ihre berechtigte Warnung heftig kritisiert wurde.   Währungsunion \\xad Politische Union?   Mit den beiden Feldern Arbeitsmarkt und Finanzpolitik sind die größten Risikopotentiale für den Erfolg der Währungsunion benannt. In diesen wie in anderen Bereichen spiegelt sich die im Maastricht-Vertrag angelegte Asymmetrie wieder. Anders als im \"Normalfall\" haben sich die Signatarstaaten bekanntlich nicht für das Prinzip \"Eine Währung \\xad ein Staat\" entschieden, sondern für das Motto \"Ein Markt \\xad eine Währung - 15 (bzw. für den Start 11) Staaten\". Seit jeher wird dem gemeinsamen Geld eine wichtige Rolle im politischen Integrationsprozeß zugemessen. Jaques Rueff hat schon 1950 die Botschaft geprägt: \"L\\'Europe se fera par la monnaie ou ne se fera pas\". Nun, da der Beginn der Währungsunion feststeht, gibt es Grund, auf die Schrittmacherrolle des Euro auf dem Weg zur Politischen Union zu vertrauen? Sicherlich wird die einheitliche Währung in vielen Bereichen vereinigende Wirkung entfalten. Gegen etwaigen politischen Widerstand wird sie sich aber in dieser Hinsicht nicht durchsetzen können. Mit dem Beginn der Währungsunion wird ein Prozeß der Suche nach dem richtigen, der Ökonom ist versucht zu sagen, optimalen Verhältnis von einheitlichem Geld und politischer Staatlichkeit eingeläutet. Die Besonderheiten der europäischen Integration verweisen jedoch jede Antwort zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt in das Reich der Spekulation. Gegenwärtig kann man beobachten, wie sich allenthalben eher die zentrifugalen Kräfte verstärken. Das muß den Erfolg der Währungsunion nicht zwangsläufig gefährden. Dies wäre freilich dann der Fall, wenn das Pochen auf nationale Kompetenz zu erheblichen Konflikten mit der auf Preisstabilität ausgerichteten Geldpolitik führte. Solide Finanzpolitik in nationaler Verantwortung und bahnbrechende Reformen, die der eigenen Volkswirtschaft auf allen Feldern hohe Flexibilität und damit neuen Schwung verleihen, würden dagegen die Aufgabe der Europäischen Zentralbank wesentlich erleichtern. Die Europäische Währungsunion ist und bleibt ein historisch singuläres Experiment mit großen Chancen. Wer jedoch die Risiken verkennt oder verschweigt, erweist diesem für die Zukunft Europas so entscheidenden Projekt keinen guten Dienst. Aufgabe der Europäischen Zentralbank wird es daher nicht nur sein, gutes, stabiles Geld zu schaffen, sondern auch vor Entwicklungen in anderen Bereichen zu warnen, die den Erfolg der Währungsunion gefährden könnten.

      "['1998-07-02', 'Otmar Issing', 'Crisis prevention: IMF surveillance, need for new teeth?', 'Statement by Professor Otmar Issing Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank at the IMF conference on The role of the IMF in the world economy to be held in Frankfurt am Main on July 2, 1998', '  Crisis prevention: IMF surveillance, need for new teeth?   Statement by Professor Otmar Issing Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank at the IMF conference on The role of the IMF in the world economy to be held in Frankfurt am Main on July 2, 1998 For a year now, the international community has been kept in suspense by the crises in Asia. Despite very large-scale assistance measures and initial successes in achieving stability in some countries, an overall calming of the situation has not yet been accomplished. Crisis management - this morning\\'s subject - is still what is needed most. Nevertheless, it does seem both sensible and necessary to look forward. Is there a better way of preventing financial crises in future? And if so, how? What lessons can be learned, especially with regard to IMF surveillance? Is surveillance effective? Can it - or, indeed, does it have to be intensified and improved? Not just more recent events - the collapse of Barings Bank, the peso crisis in Mexico and, now, turbulence in Asia - but also earlier ones in banking and monetary history force us to the conclusion that - in a market system - financial crises of one sort or another repeatedly occur under certain circumstances. Their specific causes are extremely varied . Nevertheless, they do have some features in common. The IMF, in an interesting analysis in the latest World Economic Outlook, points out that serious turbulence in the financial markets is frequently caused by unsustainable economic imbalances and misalignments of asset prices or exchange rates accompanied by rigidities in the financial system. According to this study, whether these undesirable developments actually lead to a financial crisis depends on the scale of the imbalances themselves, on a credible policy for a timely removal of the imbalances, and on the robustness of the country\\'s financial system. Precautions are therefore necessary. The key to every type of crisis prevention and crisis management lies in the history leading up to financial crises.     Policymakers must give a prompt and decisive response to macroeconomic imbalances before their scale triggers abrupt reversals of sentiment in the markets.    The financial system must be healthy and stable so that it does not itself become a source of crisis in the event of a change in the underlying conditions.    The build-up of macroeconomics imbalances must be identified at as early a stage as possible.         The role of surveillance    This is ultimately the crucial rationale for surveillance by the international community. The analysis of global economic developments undertaken by the IMF aims to identify potential adverse macroeconomic trends; it will then be incumbent on the national authorities of the countries concerned to tackle these imbalances as early as possible. In the bilateral talks between the IMF\\'s representatives and national authorities (Article IV Consultations), the economic policy of the latter will be under close scrutiny. This macroeconomic approach to surveillance has to be seen in the context of the IMF\\'s task of granting conditional financial assistance in the event of balance of payments disequilibria. This approach is important and necessary, but - in its traditional form - it will not be adequate for the future. In particular, more attention will have to be paid to international capital flows.      Inclusion of international capital flows in surveillance    Advances in electronic data processing and the liberalisation of financial transactions have led to an enormous swelling of cross-border capital flows. Some developing countries and emerging economies have become net importers of capital on a grand scale in the nineties - and it is not only foreign direct investment that has risen sharply; there has been a considerable increase in portfolio investment and in short-term financial credits, too. The increased financial investments in the emerging markets have to be seen against the backdrop of falling nominal interest rates in the industrial countries. The yields demanded by investors have possibly not declined to the same extent - in many minds, a complete break with the excessive (nominal) yields experienced in the past as a result of inflation does not appear to have taken place yet. By an \"admixture\" of high-yielding assets, professional investors are evidently attempting to approach their traditional yield level. Initially, it may indeed have made economic sense to increase investment in emerging markets; after all, such countries offered attractive earnings prospects. However, \"herd behaviour\" among the investors results in pressure on the spreads, which are then no longer an adequate reflection of the risk differentials between countries. Although asset management has become more professional in the nineties, it has also become more one-sided in a certain respect. An ever greater volume of financial resources is being managed according to comparatively similar criteria. Orientation towards a more or less exogenous benchmark and fierce competition among institutional investors compel the latter in many cases to behave in a similar fashion - no one wants to perform less well \"than the market\". As long as this short-termism prevails in the market, \"conservative\" portfolio managers will have little to benefit from swimming against the current and forgoing yield opportunities in order to avoid risks that are difficult to calculate. The market is interested only in today\\'s benchmark, and anyone who fails to hold his own now will soon find himself out of business - long before a long-term strategy could pay off. Given these market conditions, reversals of opinion have a considerably wide impact. They do not just affect the operations of individual investors, but seize hold of certain categories of institutional investors simultaneously - and repeatedly have serious repercussions not only for individual countries, but also for entire regions or groups of economies on account of spillover and contagion effects. Pointing out risks of this kind in connection with international capital flows must be a key element of IMF surveillance and will be so in future. Although the IMF will not be breaking new ground in this respect, placing greater emphasis on aspects of capital flows and the financial markets in the context of surveillance will require a suitable analytical framework as well as a readiness for transparency on the part of the member countries. Above all, it will be crucial to keep adequate track of how financial market players behave under changing conditions; this is because a system of surveillance and the provision of a framework in the area of international financial transactions that do not take account of market forces will meet with little success. One should also be aware of the limitations of this kind of extended surveillance, however. Market movements are quick and sharp and spread rapidly, making forecasts of trends in cross-border capital flows and financial markets especially difficult. We can take it for granted that the IMF - despite all its expertise - will not always be right in its estimates. For that reason, the international community will, in the final analysis, not be able to relieve market players from making an independent assessment of the situation. To what extent the IMF should make specific warnings public is still being debated in depth; a tiered response in the case of countries whose policy gets completely out of hand is under discussion. Basically, the IMF is in a dilemma in this respect. Its warnings to a country would probably carry more weight if there were a threat of their being made public. At the same time, however, announcing them publicly might trigger the very crisis that surveillance was actually meant to prevent.      Necessity of improved transparency in finance    Efficient surveillance by the IMF, just like rational decisions on the part of investors, presupposes comprehensive and reliable information on the financial circumstances not just of individual market players but also of entire economies. The IMF has now extended its proposals on this and offered its support in implementing them. It is now up to the member countries seeking access to the international capital market to implement these standards speedily and in full. Transparency is to be understood as the debt which every country owes to the international community. A matter to be considered is the extent to which the role of the IMF could or should be confined to defining the standard for supplying the data, monitoring compliance with this and pointing out any shortcomings. The evaluation itself could be left to the competition among the professional observers. The IMF would thereby be relieved of the dilemma of being at the centre of criticism, either as a \"failure\" if it does not give warnings in time or as a \"trigger\" of the crisis. When the proposals to improve transparency are being implemented, the lenders must also be called upon to exert pressure and to apply the strictest criteria to their potential partners\\' policy on business openness. Financial circumstances which are not very transparent must be construed as an additional risk of a credit exposure; those who still engage in transactions must not expect international assistance in the event of a crisis. Otherwise, the international community would be encouraging moral hazard. The efforts aimed at greater transparency and better surveillance by the IMF must not lead to negligence on the part of others either. In particular, the technical support provided by the IMF in the implementation of the publication standards should not be misconstrued as a seal of approval. Checking all transmitted data for accuracy would be beyond the capabilities of the IMF. The market players must use the available information, too: warnings must be heard and crisis signals taken seriously. The creditors themselves can make a major contribution to greater transparency. Would it not be feasible and practical if international lenders were to report their exposures to individual countries or borrowers to an independent credit register which, in turn, would return the aggregated data to the reporting institutions? In this way, the problem of asymmetrical information could be solved - at least partially - without the confidential transaction data having to be revealed. This would also provide an aid for comparing the statistical reports of debtor countries. In this way it would be comparatively easy to identify \"black sheep\". Enterprises, banks, even entire economies would be pilloried immediately if they failed to comply - or failed to comply in time - with internationally accepted publication standards; they would themselves cut off their access to the international sources of funding, as it were.      Improvement of banking supervision and good governance indispensable    The recent crises have exposed the problem of currency mismatch as a crisis-intensifying element. Short-term foreign currency loans from abroad (at favourable interest rates) were taken up for longer-term purposes (yielding higher rates of interest) in the national currency (or in third currencies). The lenders trusted explicit or implicit guarantees with regard to the exchange rate. Considerable (speculative) losses occurred when the pegging of the exchange rate could no longer be maintained. The call for a lender of last resort is fraught with problems in this situation since it is not a matter of bridging temporary liquidity difficulties but a genuine problem of profitability: at today\\'s exchange rates, many of the investments made are no longer viable. What is called for here as a preventive measure is not a lender of last resort who is declared ex ante; rather, what is required is an efficient banking supervision and good governance geared to market economy criteria. Proposals for this are on the table. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has drawn up core principles for the supervision of credit institutions which provide a suitable framework. In view of the enormous economic costs of banking crises - in the worst cases, around 50 % of GDP had to be spent on rehabilitation costs; the cumulative losses in growth are estimated at almost 20 percentage points on average - it is in every country\\'s own interests to gear its national regulatory and supervisory system to these tried-and-tested principles. Consideration ought to be given to whether the problem of banks\\' (short-term) foreign currency debt in emerging economies could be tackled in line with market principles by suitable capital adequacy standards for open foreign currency positions - without calling straightaway for a complete ban, as Tobin does, for example.      Efficient surveillance - less financing     Strengthened surveillance and better prudential supervision do not necessarily imply a reduction in capital inflows into the developing countries. Strict capital adequacy standards for banks - viewed in isolation - may limit the business volume and the borrowing opportunities of individual institutions in the international market. To the extent that investment risks are thereby reduced, however, they are also associated with positive external effects and, in that respect, make the procurement of capital easier. In dynamic terms, moreover, it is clear that the banking, exchange rate and debt crises in the developing countries have resulted in heavily fluctuating net capital flows; years of high capital imports were followed by a complete drying-up of, at least, private inflows - in some cases, even a withdrawal of private capital. A steady inflow is likely to entail much smaller adjustment costs than such extreme fluctuations. Apart from this, a warning should be given against a purely quantitative analysis in the area of external financing. Many countries do need foreign capital for their development; and large capital imports may be interpreted as an expression of optimistic expectations concerning a country\\'s growth potential. In the event of an abrupt reversal of sentiment, however, dependence on external financing may quickly turn out to be a source of crisis, especially as large imports of capital are always accompanied by corresponding deficits on current account. What is crucial for sustained economic development, therefore, is not so much the amount, but rather the type of capital inflows and the use to which they are put; that is because, in the long term, investors expect market-related yields on their assets. It will be important to take adequate account of these factors in the reorientation of surveillance.  ']\n",

Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,Frankfurt, 30 June 1998', '  Ceremony on the occasion of the establishment of the European System of Central Banks   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,Frankfurt, 30 June 1998 Mr. President of the European Council, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Blair Herr Bundeskanzler der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Dr. Kohl Mr. President of the European Parliament, Mr. Gil Robles M. le Président de la Commission européenne, M. Santer Herr Bundeskanzler der Bundesrepublik Österreich, as from tomorrow President of the European Council, Dr. Klima Ministers Ambassadors Herr Minister-Präsident des Landes Hessen, Dr. Eichel Frau Oberbürgermeisterin der Stadt Frankfurt, Frau Roth Fellow Governors, Ladies and Gentlemen, The introduction of the single currency, the euro, in eleven countries of the European Union on 1 January 1999 is more than a milestone in the process of European integration which, having started soon after the Second World War, has now been continuing for almost half a century. This process is aimed at maintaining peace and stability and fostering prosperity in Europe. Although it has experienced setbacks, on balance it has been successful. The introduction of the euro is not only the result of this process. If successful, and we all are doing our utmost to make it a success, it will give further impetus to co-operation and integration in Europe. The establishment of the European System of Central Banks is the logical consequence of the decision to introduce a single currency. No single currency without a common central bank, or rather common system of central banks, comprising the European Central Bank and the national central banks since the ESCB is a federal system. This clearly reflects the fact that Europe - or the euro area for that matter - is not a single nation, but a group of nations. The ESCB was established on 1 June, i.e. well in advance of the birth of the euro, because it has to adopt a clear framework for the conduct of the common monetary policy from 1 January 1999 onwards, it has to test all systems and procedures in the context of this framework, it has to set up its own organisation and it has to ensure a smooth transition from the current national monetary policies to the future single monetary policy. There is every reason to mark today the occasion of the establishment of the ESCB. Today is the point that separates the road behind to a common European System of Central Banks and the road we have to travel in the future to make the euro a success, which means to make it a stable currency. Looking back, it is fair to say that the road has been long and sometimes winding. Thanks to the vision and determination of a number of people we have arrived where we are today. I cannot mention everybody who has been involved in the process leading to the creation of the European Central Bank over the past decades. In terms of \"founding fathers\" I am thinking of Raymond Barre, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Helmut Schmidt, the three of whom regretfully could not be here today. I am further thinking, and they are here and I bid them a very warm welcome indeed, of Pierre Werner, responsible for the Werner Report in the early seventies, Jacques Delors, who chaired the committee named after him which mapped out the road to European Economic and Monetary Union and the ECB, and Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute in years in which many people were, to say the least, somewhat sceptical about EMU. I not only thank them for what they have done in preparation for the institution of which I have the honour of being President, I also congratulate them on what has been achieved as a result of their work The establishment of the ESCB and, somewhat later in time, the introduction of the euro are, as I said, not the end of the road, but in a sense its extension into new territory. The ESCB has been given the clear mandate of maintaining price stability, and without prejudice to that of supporting the economic policies in the Community. By fulfilling its mandate it will contribute to creating the appropriate conditions for sustainable growth of incomes and employment in the Community: the ultimate goals of economic policy. This is no easy task. The road in the future will sometimes be winding again. This is true, even in view of all the preparations for EMU by all parties concerned, like the European Commission, the European Monetary Institute, the national central banks, national governments and all private companies, institutions and individuals. The ESCB faces many challenges and I should like to share with you those which I think are the most important. The first is to make clear and show in practice that monetary policy has to be based on euro area-wide considerations. The ESCB’s monetary policy has to be one and indivisible. It has to be characterised by a truly European outlook. A precondition for adopting this outlook is that the ESCB acts as and is seen to act as a unity and speaks with \"one voice\", although sometimes in different languages. Put in modern language: this requires team-building, inevitably a process. The ESCB should be open and transparent, for at least three reasons. First, transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy by creating the correct expectations on the part of economic agents. This relates not only to actual monetary policy decisions, but applies more in general. The ESCB is endowed with an independent status and it should be explained why this independence is so vital. It should also be crystal clear about what monetary policy can and what it cannot achieve. Monetary policy can only achieve price stability in the longer term, not on a year-on-year basis. It needs to be supported by sound fiscal policies and a structural development of wages in line with productivity and the objective of price stability. Otherwise, price stability can only be maintained at a high cost in terms of lost income and employment. That is why I attach great importance to the Pact for Stability and Growth. The ESCB will have to define quantitatively what it means by price stability, it will have to explain its monetary policy strategy, have to explain its monetary policy measures, the derivation of targets, etc. In the context of what monetary policy can and cannot achieve, I repeat what I have said before on several occasions: monetary policy is neither the cause of nor the solution to the still unacceptably high level of unemployment in Europe. Solving that problem mainly requires structural policies to make markets operate more flexibly. The second reason why transparency is crucial is because in a democratic society the central bank has to account for its policies. Without the broad support of the population, ultimately no central bank can fulfil its mandate over a long period of time. The third reason is that transparency towards the outside world can also structure and discipline the internal debate inside the central bank. Let me emphasise that openness not only refers to the citizens and institutions of Europe, but also to people and institutions outside Europe. The ESCB will need to have good relations with other central banks, in particular by building on the relations of the European national central banks with other central banks around the world. Perhaps the most important challenge for the ESCB is to win the confidence of the citizens of Europe. The euro is their currency, and they should be able to trust that it keeps its value. The best way for the ESCB to acquire the necessary credibility with the citizens of Europe is to demonstrate that it takes its task of maintaining price stability very seriously. Building up a track record of stable prices will be vital in achieving this. Demonstrably stable prices are more effective in this regard than a million words in speeches, interviews and official publications. Therefore, it is essential also that policies in the remainder of this year aim at maintaining the current low levels of inflation in the euro area. That would allow the start of the euro early next year to take place in a climate of favourable price developments. I have referred to the past and briefly discussed the future. Let me now turn to the present, to today. This is the right moment to thank the Federal Republic of Germany, the Land of Hessen and the City of Frankfurt for hosting this new, truly European institution, the European Central Bank. Today is also the moment to enjoy what has been achieved by the efforts of many, but we ought at the same time to be aware of the fact that from tomorrow on the challenging task of making the euro a success will again demand our dedicated efforts. This event today caps the process of living up to the obligations assumed under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty that has become known as the Treaty of Maastricht. It seemed fitting to let the cap be put in place by the men’s choir of the city of Maastricht, the Royal Maastreechter Staar. Their first performance will be to sing short excerpts from national songs of all member states of the European Union in the respective original language.  ']\n",

Dicha alternativa tendría unos costes muy elevados en términos de inestabilidad macroeconómica, aumento de la prima de riesgo, contención de la inversión, de la actividad y del empleo y desconexión de España del proyecto económico y político europeo. La principal decisión que deberá tomar próximamente el Banco Central Europeo (BCE) es la relativa a la estrategia más adecuada de política económica. Una estrategia combinada de objetivos directos de inflación con objetivos intermedios monetarios parece la opción más recomendable, al menos al inicio de la tercera fase de la UEM. La estabilidad de la demanda de dinero en el conjunto del área euro es el elemento clave para ponderar el grado de aplicación de una u otra estrategia. En el plano institucional, el elemento básico para el éxito del BCE es la independencia. Dicha independencia es como un poliedro compuesto de diversos planos: el institucional funcional, el del régimen de los órganos de gobierno, el financiero, el personal. Independencia no es aislamiento, ni falta de transparencia, ni ausencia de rendición de cuentas. Transparencia, comunicación, rendición de cuentas, aparte de requisitos de responsabilidad democrática, constituyen factores que coadyuvan a la efectividad de las medidas de política monetaria al posibilitar una mejor comprensión por parte del público y de los mercados. La independencia, la adopción de una perspectiva europea y, sobre todo, una actuación encaminada inequívocamente a la estabilidad es clave para que el BCE adquiera credibilidad entre los ciudadanos de la Unión Europea.

Duisenberg', 'Zur Bedeutung der 50-jährigen Stabilitätsgeschichte der D-Mark für Europa und die künftige Europäische Währung', 'Vortrag des Präsidenten der Europäischen Zentralbank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, aus Anlaß des 50-jährigen Jubiläums der D-Mark am 19. Juni 1998 im Haus der Geschichte in Bonn', '  Zur Bedeutung der 50-jährigen Stabilitätsgeschichte der D-Mark für Europa und die künftige Europäische Währung   Vortrag des Präsidenten der Europäischen Zentralbank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, aus Anlaß des 50-jährigen Jubiläums der D-Mark am 19. Juni 1998 im Haus der Geschichte in Bonn Sehr geehrter Herr Minister, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, es ist eine große Freude für mich, heute aus Anlaß des fünfzigjährigen Jahrestages der Geburtsstunde der Deutschen Mark zu Ihnen sprechen zu dürfen. Man kann mit Fug und Recht sagen, daß die D-Mark in diesen 50 Jahren eine außergewöhnliche, zu Beginn wohl nicht einmal in den kühnsten Träumen erwartete Erfolgsgeschichte erlebte. Eine Geschichte, die - gestatten Sie mir das gleich zu Anfang meiner kurzen Rede zu betonen - mit dem Euro eine einzigartige Bestätigung und Fortsetzung erfährt. Im Rückblick auf die wirtschaftliche und auch politische Entwicklung Deutschlands im letzten halben Jahrhundert besteht aller Grund zur Zufriedenheit; man denke nur an die desolate wirtschaftliche Lage und die Zerrüttung des Geldwesens zu Beginn der Nachkriegszeit. Mit der Entscheidung zur Einführung der D-Mark stellten die westlichen Alliierten damals die entscheidende Weiche. Die mutige und weitsichtige Durchsetzung marktwirtschaftlicher Strukturen vor allem durch Ludwig Erhard bildete die wesentliche Grundlage für den wirtschaftlichen Aufstieg Deutschlands und für die Erfolgsgeschichte der D-Mark. Diese Erkenntnis ist auch heute von zentraler Bedeutung für die Europäische Währung, den Euro. Anerkennung für den Erfolg der D-Mark gebührt insbesondere der Deutschen Bundesbank und ihrer Vorgängerin, der 1948 gegründeten Bank deutscher Länder, denn auf lange Sicht wird die Stabilität einer Währung von einer umsichtigen, vorausschauend handelnden Geldpolitik und der daraus resultierenden angemessenen Liquiditätsversorgung der Wirtschaft bestimmt. Ohne ihre Unabhängigkeit, ohne eine ausgeprägte Stabilitätskultur, ohne die breite Unterstützung in der Bevölkerung und ohne eine solide Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik wäre es allerdings auch für die Bundesbank nicht möglich gewesen, die D-Mark zu dem zu machen was sie heute ist. Gestatten Sie mir deshalb den Hinweis, daß auch das Europäische System der Zentralbanken die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik in den Teilnehmerstaaten benötigt, und zwar vor allem in Form einer Finanzdisziplin entsprechend den Regeln des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspaktes. Ebenso wichtig sind weitere strukturelle, marktwirtschaftlich orientierte Reformen. Eine Senkung der Steuer- und Abgabenlast, die Flexibilisierung der Arbeits- und Produktmärkte sowie weitere Lohnzurückhaltung sind entscheidende Ansatzpunkte zur dringend gebotenen nachhaltigen Verbesserung der Beschäftigungssituation. Eine so ausgerichtete Politik würde es dem Europäischen System der Zentralbanken erleichtern, die Preisstabilität dauerhaft zu sichern und damit gleichzeitig den besten Beitrag der Geldpolitik zum langfristigen Abbau der Arbeitslosigkeit zu leisten. Zu den Lehren aus der Stabilitätsgeschichte der D-Mark für den Euro gehört ferner, daß sich die Bundesbank mit großer Resonanz nicht nur zu rein geldpolitischen Fragen, sondern auch zu Themen aus anderen Bereichen der Wirtschaftspolitik zu Wort gemeldet hat. Entsprechende Analysen und Stellungnahmen werden ein Teil der Kommunikationspolitik des Europäischen Systems der Zentralbanken sein. Auch auf diesem Wege kann ein Beitrag zur Verwirklichung der in Artikel 2 im EU Vertrag festgelegten Ziele der Gemeinschaft geleistet werden. Das hohe Maß an innerer und äußerer Stabilität sowie die internationale Anerkennung, die sich die D-Mark im Laufe der letzten fünf Jahrzehnte erworben hat, sind zugleich Grundlage und Symbol der insgesamt positiven gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung in dieser Zeit. Ich kann mir deshalb gut vorstellen, daß nicht wenige Menschen in Deutschland dieses Jubiläum - angesichts des engen zeitlichen Zusammenhangs mit der Gründung der Europäischen Zentralbank zu Beginn dieses Monats und dem Start der Europäischen Währungsunion am 1. Januar 1999 - mit etwas Wehmut, ja vielleicht auch mit Sorge sehen. Der \"Abschied von der D-Mark\" fällt gewiß nicht leicht. Es ist jedoch keinesfalls gerechtfertigt zu behaupten, die Europäischen Währungsunion brächte auch den Abschied von einer stabilen und international anerkannten Währung. Um dies deutlich zu machen, ist es besonders wichtig, die Menschen darüber zu informieren, daß die Inflationsrate in den Ländern, die den Euro einführen bei zwei Prozent oder darunter liegt. Dies weist der Konvergenzbericht des EWI mit bezug auf den Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex aus. Auch für deutsche Maßstäbe ist das ein sehr gutes Ergebnis, das deutlich unter dem Inflationsdurchschnitt der letzten 10 oder 20 Jahre liegt. Die Notenbanken der Teilnehmerländer haben in den letzten Jahren - in einigen Fällen sind dies mittlerweile zwei Jahrzehnte - klar unter Beweis gestellt, daß sie der Deutschen Bundesbank im Kampf gegen die Inflation und im Stabilitätswillen um nichts nachstehen. Der Beitrag der Stabilitätsgeschichte der D-Mark für die europäische Integration im allgemeinen und die Entwicklung zur Währungsunion im besonderen ist zweifellos herausragend. Dies zeigt sich nicht zuletzt darin, daß viele Nachbarländer die D-Mark als Anker für ihre Währungen ausgewählt haben und auch in schwierigen Zeiten diese Anbindung verteidigen konnten. Ebenso erwähnenswert ist die Tatsache, daß die strikte Stabilitätsorientierung und die praktizierte Unabhängigkeit der Bundesbank zum Vorbild für das Notenbankstatut des EU-Vertrags wurde. Nach Lage der Dinge sind damit - sowie mit dem Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt - die bestmöglichen Grundlagen für einen stabilen Euro geschaffen. Manche Skepsis gegenüber dem Euro hängt wohl auch damit zusammen, daß man die bewährte D-Mark gegen ein neues, noch unbekanntes Geld eintauscht. Die Menschen neigen wohl generell dazu, die in der Beibehaltung der gegebenen Strukturen liegenden künftigen Risiken zu unterschätzen, gerade dann, wenn bisher alles so gut gelaufen ist wie das bei der D-Mark der Fall ist. Vielfach wird übersehen, daß auch eine Entscheidung gegen die Währungsunion und für die Beibehaltung der D-Mark angesichts veränderter Umfeldbedingungen mit zahlreichen, teilweise neuen Risiken verbunden gewesen wäre. Gewiß, eine so weitreichende Entscheidung wie die Einführung des Euro ist auch nicht völlig ohne Risiken, dies liegt in der Natur der Sache. Ich bin jedoch überzeugt, daß die Chancen klar überwiegen. Die Entscheidung für den Euro muß auch vor dem Hintergrund eines sich für uns alle rapide ändernden weltwirtschaftlichen Umfeldes gesehen werden. Wir müssen uns der Tatsache der zunehmenden Vernetzung und Interdependenzen in der Welt stellen. Es gibt keine Alternative zur Europäischen Integration. Der großen Aufgabe, diese zum Erfolg zu führen, ist man mit der Entscheidung für die Währungsunion sicher ein Stück näher gekommen. Die fünfzigjährige Stabilitätsgeschichte der D-Mark hat dazu nicht nur wesentlich beigetragen, sie ist auch Ansporn und Verpflichtung für die Europäische Zentralbank, die in besonderer Weise in der Stabilitätskontinuität der Deutschen Bundesbank steht. Die Geldpolitik des Europäische System der Zentralbanken wird und muß dabei stets auf den Euro-Währungsraum als Ganzes ausgerichtet sein; auf die spezifische Lage in einzelnen teilnehmenden Ländern wird sie darüber hinaus nicht gezielt reagieren können. Auch das ist eine Lehre, die sich aus der deutschen Geldpolitik ziehen läßt, die ebenfalls stets auf das gesamte Währungsgebiet der D-Mark und nicht auf einzelne Bundesländer ausgerichtet war. Lassen Sie mich noch einige kurze Schlußbemerkungen anfügen. In fünfzigjähriger Arbeit haben die Menschen und die verantwortlichen Institutionen in Deutschland eine stabile und weltweit anerkannte Währung geschaffen und damit in hervorragender Weise den Boden für eine Fortsetzung dieser Erfolgsgeschichte auf europäischer Ebene bereitet. Ich bin überzeugt, diese Tatsache gibt den Menschen in Deutschland allen Grund, etwaige Wehmut und Sorge beim \"Abschied von der D-Mark\" in Freude und auch Zuversicht umzuwandeln. Es ist sicher keine leichte Aufgabe, den Euro zu einer ebenso stabilen und weltweit geachteten Währung wie die D-Mark zu machen. Ich kann Ihnen jedoch versichern, daß meine Kollegen und ich alles daran setzen werden, dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Atmosphäre und die Ergebnisse der Arbeit in den ersten Wochen der Existenz der Europäischen Zentralbank stimmen mich in dieser Hinsicht durchaus optimistisch.  ']\n",
      "['1998-03-05', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The euro and the process of European integration', 'Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Seventh Bernard Mandeville Lecture in Rotterdam - the Netherlands, 5 March 1998 (translated from the original Dutch)', \"  The euro and the process of European integration   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Seventh Bernard Mandeville Lecture in Rotterdam - the Netherlands, 5 March 1998 (translated from the original Dutch) Mandeville, after whom this series of lectures is named, emphasised even before Adam Smith that individuals who strive for their own interests may unintentionally bring something about which is in the interests of all. He can thus be seen as one of the founders of the philosophy behind the market mechanism. What is required to make this market mechanism function properly is a set of institutions. A healthy currency unit and a central bank to watch over it belong to this group of necessary institutions. The question as to the extent to which institutions can be designed, or rather must be the result of a spontaneous, evolutionary process of individuals striving for their own interests, is a fundamental issue. Mandeville would tend towards the latter view. I am, as you know, no philosopher, so I will not attempt to formulate a fundamental answer to this fundamental question. Intuitively, or if you prefer, amateurishly, I am inclined to think that this is not a simple matter of 'either... or', but that both approaches can play a role. Any other response would sound strange coming from the President of an institution which has the singular task of designing new institutions - the euro and the European Central Bank - and making them work to everybody's satisfaction. These opening remarks bring me straight to the matter in hand: the huge institutional change in monetary affairs in Europe which is now at hand. 1998 is an important year for Europe. This year - in eight weeks' time to be precise - the decision will be taken as to which countries will introduce a single currency, the euro, on the first of January 1999. In just three weeks’ time the decision-making process will start formally with the publication by the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission of reports assessing the progress made by the various countries with regard to economic convergence. The European Commission will attach a recommendation to its report as to which countries are ready for the introduction of the euro. The European Parliament will publish an opinion and national parliaments will also debate the selection issue. All this will culminate in the first weekend in May, first in a recommendation by the Finance Ministers, and the same weekend, in the decision by the Heads of State or Government on the participating 'euro countries'. Subsequently, bilateral exchange rates will be announced against which the currencies of the euro countries will be converted to the euro. With the appointment of the members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, according to the Treaty of Maastricht, this institution will be established, and 'my' institution, the European Monetary Institute, will go into liquidation. This will presumably take place around the end of May and beginning of June. Up to the end of the year, the ECB will prepare the actual introduction of the euro and the single monetary policy. I see the introduction of the euro in a broad perspective. The introduction of the euro and the associated single European monetary policy are not isolated steps, but a part - albeit a very important one - of the process of European integration which effectively started immediately after, or even perhaps during, World War II. Thus it is a process, and a process which involves more than just economics. Economists very often analyse the euro simply in economic terms. There is nothing wrong with this, because the economic aspect is important. However, what is objectionable is that people all too often draw conclusions about the euro based on purely economic arguments. Thus one loses sight of the broader context of the euro. Before I come to that, there is another mistake which is often made and has to do with taking too narrow a view. This is that people often point to the risks of the introduction of the euro on the implicit assumption that the alternative to European Economic and Monetary Union, hereafter referred to as 'EMU', is an everlasting and risk-free continuation of the world as we know it. That is not so. EMU is not without risk, but nor is the alternative. It is easier to appreciate this if we look at EMU in a broader context. The background to the process of European integration is, as I see it, above all organising Europe in such a way that the great conflicts of this century, two world wars, do not recur in the future. One way of achieving this is to incorporate Germany into a European structure. Without this policy, ultimately all problems confronting Europe directly or indirectly would end up on Germany’s plate. That would force Germany into a leadership role, which we do not want, and Germany no longer wants. As Thomas Mann put it, and others have repeated: it is a choice between a European Germany or a German Europe. European integration is the choice of Europe, including Germany, as the first alternative. The great changes which took place in eastern Europe almost ten years ago reinforced the need for European integration. The almost automatically unifying element of the confrontation with Communism thereby disappeared. The position of unified Germany was potentially, and in the long term, stronger. Germany not only became larger: through the developments in the east it also came to occupy a more central position in Europe, as it were. In addition to this motif there is another motif, which is narrower and also has an economic component. This is the advance of the de facto German monetary hegemony over the last decades. The Deutsche Bundesbank in effect largely determines the levels of interest rates in other European countries. And however successful those countries may have been, partly as a result, in achieving price stability, larger countries in particular cannot in the long term accept being tied to Germany’s apron strings in monetary matters. A European Central Bank places monetary policy within a European framework. In this way, it is an example of the movement from a German Europe to a Europe in which Germany is included. To this end, Germany is prepared to replace the Deutsche Mark with the euro. This should not be judged lightly. Germany is thereby, of its own volition, giving up a symbol, I would even say the symbol, of successful German policy since World War II, and relinquishing economic and administrative power. In this light it is quite understandable that Germany has continually asked for guarantees and makes repeated pleas for a stable euro. The process of integration in Europe is always, first and foremost, managed by means of the economic component. Integration may be expected to have a positive effect on prosperity: this is clearly documented in economic theory; but we can also expect that common economic interests will make conflicts less likely. European integration started with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early fifties, intended above all to remove two of the major constituents of heavy military armament, energy and iron, from national or, if you will, nationalistic decision-making, and has proceeded step by step to the Single Market programme and now to the introduction of the euro. The euro can be seen as the final piece in the Single Market. Failure to introduce the euro could put this in jeopardy. After all, one should not underestimate the extent to which depreciation of the currency can again lead to a flare-up of protectionist 'counter-measures'. The Single Market only operates well if there is sufficient exchange rate stability. In a Europe with free movement of capital it is no longer possible to guarantee this by means of a system of stable but adjustable exchange rates. Such systems have proved vulnerable and can fall prey to speculative attacks, which may be unwarranted by the underlying economic conditions. Even the traditionally super-strong link between the Dutch guilder and the Deutsche Mark is not permanently assured without EMU. However, the process of integration will not be completed with the introduction of the euro. The process of European integration will also continue because many countries in central and eastern Europe will wish to join the EU. The accession of these countries can only take place in stages. The introduction of the euro is the last stage, which must not be forced. First, these countries must integrate their economies solidly into the EU. Then participation in the new exchange rate mechanism can follow. Ultimately, the euro can be introduced. The prospective entrants will have to meet the same requirements as the countries which will introduce the euro at the start of next year. That will take considerable time - time which must also be used to consider any changes in the working methods of the ESCB if that is to consist of between 20 and 30 national central banks. There are issues here which may be even more difficult than the decision concerning which countries will participate on the first of January 1999. It would be advisable to consider these matters in good time. This would prevent the man in the street and politicians alike later being caught off guard and feeling overtaken by events, as often seems to be the case in European debates. How must the process of European integration be judged on the basis of its own objectives, as I have just formulated them? I say: positively. Participating countries have now known peace for more than 50 years and much has been achieved in the economic field. Of course I am not deaf to all criticism, nor unaware of friction among Member States, and the failures that sometimes occur. I also recognise that the next step, the introduction of the euro, is not without risk and undoubtedly there will be problems to be overcome. Whatever else it may be, it will not be dull. However, my attitude is that taking this step offers great opportunities and that the risks are manageable, as long as one is not blind to them. To break off the process of European integration at this point - which is what failure to introduce the euro would mean - would throw Europe into great confusion. No viable political alternative exists. Why, therefore, the introduction of EMU and the euro? First of all because of the political reasons discussed. They are no less important than economic reasons, nor is there any reason for economists to sneer at them. Peace and security can also be analysed in economic terms. I would add the footnote that the introduction of the euro will not automatically have an integrating effect. Some people feel that it will actually increase the potential for conflict, not only between those who are in and those who are out, but between those who are in, among themselves. I am not that pessimistic, but I am convinced that the euro can only contribute to political integration if all EU countries have the prospect of joining EMU, and if the countries which have joined demonstrate the political will to accept that the introduction of a single currency and a single monetary policy means that interest rates must be brought to the level which is best for the entire euro region and not for individual countries. The introduction of the euro also has clear economic advantages. It removes the uncertainty over exchange rates from a large part of Europe. That is good for trade, and particularly for countries such as the Netherlands, which conduct a great deal of trade within Europe. It increases the transparency of the European market, which makes it easier to benefit from economies of scale, but - or rather, in addition - it encourages competition. The European System of Central Banks will also try to bring about price stability over a large area which, if successful, will be an important condition for a sustainable, real (i.e. actual) growth in income and employment. The economic advantages of EMU increase in proportion to the size and stability of the euro region. Perhaps it is ironic that the advantages are greater the more countries which have in the past had long periods of stability problems are included in a stable EMU. The art, of course, is to combine size and stability as well as possible. This does not detract from the fact that risks may emerge and questions may be raised and that we must be prepared to learn from experience. That is why EMU is not the end of the process of integration, but the start of a learning process. In the rest of my lecture I would like to discuss a number of frequently raised issues and fears, without of course, making any claim to completeness.  One of the first views expressed is that unemployment is too high for the European Central Bank to give top priority to achieving price stability, as the Treaty of Maastricht does. This attitude is based on a - sadly persistent - misunderstanding, which is that unemployment in Europe can be solved by lax monetary policy. However, unemployment in Europe is primarily a structural phenomenon, which requires measures to allow markets to function better. The best contribution monetary policy can make to growth and employment is to ensure price stability. Artificially stimulating employment by means of lax monetary policy does not lead to lasting low levels of unemployment, but ultimately it does lead to higher inflation. In that sense, it is a policy of shooting oneself in the foot.  Another issue is why the European System of Central Banks has been made so independent of politics. Does that not mean that monetary policy has insufficient democratic legitimacy? Making the central banks independent is a world-wide trend. This is prompted by the realisation that monetary policy can have a direct effect on growth and employment in the short term, but only directly affects inflation in the long term. There is always a temptation to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the short term. The growth in employment - later shown to be artificial - and the consequent improvement in election prospects come first, inflation and economic instability come later. Politicians recognise the seductive call of these sirens and they want to avoid giving in to this strong temptation. Therefore, they allow themselves, like Odysseus, to be bound to the mast by giving an independent central bank the task of ensuring price stability as its sole purpose. In practice, this construction causes tension on one point, or, to stay with Homer, has one Achilles' heel. In the short term it is true that monetary policy affects growth and employment. This makes the conduct of policy very delicate and the reading of the economic situation very precarious. The conduct of policy will also depend on the state of budgetary policy and on wage developments. This all leads to a desire in society to call the central bank to account for the choices it has made. This is understandable and, in my opinion, justifiable, but one has to be careful not to throw the baby of independence out with the bathwater of accountability. After all, the fact that monetary policy only has short-term effects on growth and employment is the very reason for placing the central bank at a distance from politics. The desire for accountability must not run over into exerting pressure on the central bank. My conclusion for the European System of Central Banks is that monetary policy must be as transparent as possible. That means that the ESCB must always make clear in word and deed how it sees the situation and that it explains its measures. To the public and to politicians; to governments and parliaments; to the European Council of Ministers and to the European Parliament. It also means that the ESCB must quantify precisely what it understands by price stability and must announce in advance what its target is. The target itself must be clearly formulated and any deviation must be explained. Transparent monetary policy is not only important, and perhaps not even primarily important, in terms of the accountability of the central bank. It can also promote the efficiency of policy by creating the right expectations in the participants in the economic process concerning what the monetary authorities hope to achieve: monetary policy must be predictable. This contributes to achieving stable prices with as little friction as possible. The ESCB is a system for the entire euro region and that must be manifest in the communication of its decisions. The remark that the ESCB is for the entire euro region also means that not all communications need pass exclusively via the centre. The national central banks can also play a useful role. They can communicate in their own language, taking into account the particular circumstances of their own country. The point is that communication should be carried out consistently throughout the euro region. It is crucial that the Eurotower in Frankfurt, the seat of the ECB, does not become an ivory tower. The ESCB must be open to contact with politicians, both sides of industry and parliaments. In these contacts it must not only provide explanations but also be a good listener. The sine qua non is that the independence of the ESCB should be respected in these contacts. The democratic legitimacy of the ECB is based on the fact that its duties are laid down in law, that the members of its Executive Board are appointed by elected politicians and that it offers explanations and is accountable in various ways for its analyses and the measures based on them. Admittedly this does not go as far as in politics, since those to whom it is accountable cannot impose any sanctions on the ECB, but that is just an inevitable consequence of opting for independent decision-making. And that is a choice which was made for good reasons.  Another frequently asked question is: have the economies in Europe really converged sufficiently to be able to implement a single monetary policy? This is the key question, and it is not easy to answer. I do not agree with those who say that the creation of the right institutions is enough for the creation of a monetary union. My vision is closer to the economic theory of optimum currency areas, which says that certain conditions must be met if an area is to introduce a single currency. These conditions are not automatically met by introducing a single currency and setting up the right institutions. The latter can help, it is true, but it is not sufficient. It is therefore right that convergence criteria in the areas of inflation, long-term interest rates, exchange rate stability and government deficits and debt were formulated in the Maastricht Treaty. I do not deny that these criteria are, to a certain extent, arbitrary, almost by definition. Economic theory cannot come up with precise quantitative criteria to establish the viability of a monetary union. It will always require a certain amount of political will, and there will always be a certain amount of risk. The convergence will never be perfect. Therefore, the decision about the introduction of EMU is ultimately also a political decision. How is economic convergence going in Europe? You will appreciate that I will not talk about individual countries. In general, however, one may say that in many areas good, sometimes even remarkable, progress has been made. With regard to inflation and long-term interest rates, 14 of the 15 Member States already clearly meet the criteria. Also, over the last few years there has been a remarkable degree of exchange rate stability between the European currencies. Finally, government deficits and debt: there are still countries in a situation in which a sound analysis is required under the terms of the Treaty. This requires that a multitude of factors be taken into account, such as medium-term economic and budgetary prospects. The EMI will produce the said sound analysis in the report to be published on 25 March. The European Commission will also publish a report, as I said earlier. The decision will ultimately be taken by the Heads of State or Government. Although it is thus too early to draw conclusions, one thing is certain: among the participants in EMU there will be a large number who will have their work cut out in the next few years in the area of public finances. But that would have been equally true without EMU. Politicians are well aware of this: in the 'Stability and Growth Pact’ they agreed to endeavour to achieve budgetary positions that are close to balance or even in surplus.  A question which is linked to the previous one is whether labour and product markets in Europe really have the necessary flexibility to cope with the introduction of a single currency. This is a pertinent question, which arises from the idea that the official convergence criteria are not complete. There is a risk here and also a role for policy. The role of policy will be to go further towards allowing markets to operate more flexibly. Politically, this is not an easy matter, since it requires painful measures, the effects of which are not immediately perceptible. However, I would stress that this policy is necessary not only to ensure the smooth operation of EMU, but also to solve the biggest economic problem in Europe, namely high unemployment. Thus it is a double-edged sword: what is good for EMU is also necessary for the solution of the unemployment problem.  Another, related, question is: How can the euro countries adapt to economic setbacks which only affect them, or affect them more than other countries (what we call 'asymmetric shocks'), now that they can no longer use the instrument of devaluation and aim for a lower interest rate than other countries? This question is related to the previous one, and the answer is thus in part the same. One way of addressing this type of shock is to let wages and prices react flexibly to them. In addition I would point out that the appropriateness of the exchange rate as a mechanism for absorbing country-specific shocks must not be exaggerated. Devaluations only work if the workforce does not translate the resulting price rises into wage rises. If it does, as has often been the case historically, the result of devaluing a currency is simply higher inflation, and postponement of the inevitable adjustment to changed circumstances. This does not detract from, indeed it emphasises, the importance of adequate adjustment mechanisms. High mobility of labour is, I believe, unlikely to play any great role in Europe for the time being. The language barriers in particular are too high for that. In addition to flexibility of wages and prices, the design of EMU also provides for another important adjustment mechanism. The Stability and Growth Pact encompasses this. By keeping their budgetary positions roughly in balance in normal circumstances, governments create a margin to deal with disappointing economic trends without having to make cut-backs. Allowing the deficit to increase in such circumstances automatically counterbalances the economic problem. Of course, the ceiling for the deficit in the Maastricht Treaty must not be exceeded, except under truly exceptional circumstances. We are talking here about the familiar 3% of GDP. The margin this provides should not be underestimated. For the Netherlands it represents more than NLG 20 billion. This budgetary mechanism is not only available for country-specific shocks, it also helps to soften the blow of unfavourable trends affecting the euro area as a whole. The existence of this mechanism at national level makes loan financing at European level to offset country-specific shocks superfluous. National budgets can only fulfil their shock-absorbing role if they really are close to balance under normal circumstances. If not, then the shock is not absorbed, but hits the 3% safety rail prematurely. In view of the level (around 3%) of many government deficits at the moment, one must inevitably conclude that government deficits must continue to be reduced in the coming years.  The next issue I want to address is whether monetary union can exist without political union, or whether we need a budgetary counterpart to the ESCB? It is undoubtedly true that the establishment and functioning of a monetary union is easier if at the same time there is also a political union. There is then a single budgetary authority for the single monetary authority to deal with. It also simplifies the creation of a basis for monetary policy which by its very nature is single and indivisible in a region where developments will never quite be synchronised. However, in reality Europe is not at that stage, or has not yet reached that stage. Yet there are provisions in the Treaty, subsequently elaborated further, for example in the Stability and Growth Pact, which aim to create the conditions under which a monetary union would be workable without a political union in Europe. Think, for example, of the relationships, formal and informal, which are envisaged between the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN and the ECB. These relationships aside, the Stability and Growth Pact is an initiative to ensure that budgetary policy does not cramp the conduct of monetary policy. By reducing and practically eliminating government deficits, this can be guaranteed. The Pact is rather vaguer about assessing the budget situation in the euro region as a whole. It is conceivable that the sum of the budget balances, while individually in line with the Stability Pact, could produce an overall result which is unsatisfactory - for example, where the euro region as a whole has a balance of payments deficit. Then further co-ordination of the budgetary policies of the individual countries might be necessary. In any case, such a situation is not an immediate concern, since the euro region is expected to have a modest balance of payments surplus. All in all, there are sufficient channels for co-ordination and the exchange of information. Much will naturally depend on how these are used in practice. The agreements which have been made so far are not necessarily the last word. We will have to learn from experience. Further evolution may take place on the basis of that experience.  Now I come to the last question: Will the ESCB pursue too tight a monetary policy just to establish its credibility? An easy one for a change. This fear is unfounded. The ESCB must pursue whatever policy is necessary to achieve and maintain price stability. Don’t forget that this is laid down in the Treaty. Taking an extra-strong line would not contribute to the realisation of this goal. The point is to strike the correct balance between inflationary and deflationary risks, and to set interest rates in such a way that price stability is the most likely outcome. Monetary policy is partly an art. Monetary policy decisions cannot be taken mechanically; they can't be calculated. That is nothing new, but certainly at the start of EMU, when the financial sector will be in transition, predicting economic trends and the effect of policy measures may be more difficult than usual. In this context, it is very important that inflation rates in many European countries currently are not only close together, but also low. Inflation in the European Union is running at less than 2%. Many European national central banks consider this level to be in keeping with price stability. Complete absence of measurable inflation is not required, because the measurement of actual inflation is beset by errors, on balance on the positive side. If this situation can be maintained until January 1999 - and that is the objective of the current policy - then the ESCB will be able to start its work under favourable conditions. Tight monetary policy from the outset of the single currency will then be unnecessary. I draw three conclusions:      EMU must be seen as a process in a broad economic and political context.     EMU is not the end of this process, but another step on the way.     EMU offers economic and political opportunities. However, there are also risks, and the opportunities must not be passed up. Political will, sensible economic policy and the will to learn from experience are essential conditions for making EMU a success.     \"]\n",

Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Bankers’ Club Annual Banquet in London, 16 February 1998', '  The ESCB: independent, transparent and communicative   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Bankers’ Club Annual Banquet in London, 16 February 1998  Introduction  Undoubtedly, the establishment of European Economic and Monetary Union is one of the most significant developments in the international monetary system in the last fifty years. Although the United Kingdom has decided to make use of its opt-out negotiated at Maastricht, whether \"in\" or \"out\", the introduction of the euro will have a significant impact on the UK economy. I should like, therefore, to devote the first few minutes of my speech to the question of the United Kingdom’s position on EMU. However, I have chosen as my main theme this evening to talk about a number of key features of the ESCB. The ESCB will be independent, and I shall try to explain the background to this and what it means. I shall also discuss the issue of how central bank independence can be combined with accountability, with transparency in decision-making, and the way in which the ESCB may conduct a fruitful dialogue - an exchange of views and information - with government ministers, European institutions (such as the European Parliament), social partners and the general public. These are, of course, issues with which you will be familiar in the United Kingdom, not least because they have recently been discussed in this country in the context of the establishment of new arrangements for the conduct of monetary policy by the Bank of England.   The UK decision to opt out   Let me say, first of all, that of course I respect the decision as regards the opt-out made at the end of last year by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer. On the one hand, I think it is unfortunate that such an important country as the United Kingdom will not participate from the outset. However, it was useful to end the speculation and uncertainty that surrounded the UK’s position and I was pleased to hear that the government not only is in favour of joining EMU in principle, but also plans to assess this in terms of the economic benefits to the United Kingdom. The debate in the United Kingdom very often focuses on the political aspects or, if you want, the more psychological aspects of the matter. The Chancellor in my view rightly made it clear that EMU also needs to be assessed on the economic merits of the case. As to the possible entry of the UK to the euro-area, I only want to mention very briefly one particular issue. That is the issue of exchange rate stability of the pound sterling. Even allowing for the fact that the United Kingdom is not a member of the ERM, which according to the Treaty is a criterion for entry to EMU, there has not been a high degree of stability of the exchange rate. Achieving lasting exchange rate stability will be necessary for the UK to be eligible to join the euro-area. In the future, this will require an increased emphasis on the exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro in the framework of the UK’s monetary policy. I make this point not just for the sake of formality, because it is required in the Treaty. Above all, I say this for economic reasons: to strengthen credibility and inspire confidence in the irrevocable fixing of an exchange rate at a certain point in time, it is necessary that for a considerable period prior to that moment that exchange rate is perceived by the markets as stable, or \"quasi-fixed\", already. After all, this is the fundamental reason why the so-called exchange rate criterion was included in the Treaty in the first place. But let me now turn to the main subject of my talk.   Independence of the ESCB: the historical background   Before considering the independence of the ESCB as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, it is worth looking briefly at the historical background. Significant changes have taken place in the thinking with regard to the role of monetary policy in the last two decades. There has been a growing recognition, perhaps stemming from the turbulent experience of the 1970s, that in the long term monetary policy can only systematically control the price level and not real economic variables such as output growth or unemployment. Over a shorter horizon, monetary policy does indeed affect both real and nominal variables. However, it is by now widely accepted among policy-makers and in the academic literature that any deliberate attempt to exploit the short-run trade-off between prices and output is ultimately going to result in a permanently higher and more variable rate of inflation, with significant adverse consequences for resource allocation, long-run output and employment, productivity growth, as well as the income distribution. Against this background, the primary goal of monetary policy has increasingly become the achievement and maintenance of price stability, with any other economic objectives receiving emphasis only to the extent that price stability is not endangered. This is a recognition of the adverse consequences of inflation and of the efficacy of monetary policy in this field, while at the same time being an acknowledgement that there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve. Primarily, the monetary authorities can support job creation and the attainment of higher living standards by fostering a stable macroeconomic environment in which business decisions can be made. Partly as a consequence of this widespread consensus regarding the limits of monetary policy, there has been a tendency to delegate responsibility for conducting monetary policy to independent central banks, as the most appropriate way of ensuring price stability oriented policies. Modern economic theory emphasises the inflationary bias in economic policy, which relates in particular to the so-called time-inconsistency issue, i.e. the problem of convincing financial markets and the general public that the monetary authorities will resist the temptation to stimulate output growth in the short run by creating \"inflationary surprises\". The public may lack faith in the authorities’ promises to maintain low inflation if the authorities have succumbed to the temptation in the past. Unless these promises are underpinned by a credible form of pre-commitment, the equilibrium inflation rate will be higher than is needed, with no better performance in terms of output - and possibly even a deterioration. As a solution to this problem, it has been suggested that responsibility for monetary policy be separated from political control and that this should also be enshrined in legislation. According to this view, central banks should be given the freedom to formulate and execute monetary policy in line with their primary objective as determined by the legislator. This allows central banks to take a medium-term orientation and not to be distracted by short-term political motives, an approach which benefits the credibility, transparency, predictability and efficiency of monetary policy. In line with the foregoing analysis, more and more EU central banks - but also an increasing number of central banks outside Europe as well have over time been assigned the task of guaranteeing price stability, either explicitly by national law, or more informally as a reflection of an underlying culture of stability. In many cases, these reforms went hand-in-hand with the move towards a greater degree of central bank independence. This rather broad consensus - both with regard to the role of monetary policy and the appropriate institutional arrangements for its conduct - had been broadly reached prior to the initiation of deliberations on the design of the future ESCB. In this respect, we have been in the rather fortunate position of being able to utilise and implement this consensus in the design of the future ESCB; the fruits of this quite long monetary policy \"soul searching\", so to speak, are evident in the design of the ESCB. Thus, in the institutional arrangements for Stage Three of Monetary Union, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty and the ESCB Statute, the primary objective - the maintenance of price stability - is stated explicitly. The Treaty also states that, without prejudice to this objective, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community. Both the Treaty (in Article 107) and the Statute of the ESCB (in Article 7) contain very clear provisions regarding the independence of the ESCB. To quote a key sentence: \"neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body\". Moreover, the aforementioned authorities shall also - and I quote again - \"undertake to respect this principle and not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks\". For national central banks to become an integral part of the ESCB, Member States have to ensure that national legislation is compatible with the Treaty (Article 108) and the Statute of the ESCB (Article 14). This obligation of legal convergence does not require the full harmonisation of central bank statutes, but does insist that inconsistencies with the Treaty be eliminated in respect of features such as institutional, personal, functional and financial independence. With the exceptions of Denmark and the United Kingdom, this requirement applies to all Member States, including those which may initially be unable to adopt the single currency owing to insufficient economic convergence. Member States have made significant progress in recent years in amending their central bank statutes where needed in order to fulfil their Treaty obligations. For those interested in further details, I would refer you to the EMI’s report on legal convergence published last October, which contained a detailed account for each country of the provisions which would still need to be adapted. An update of this will be included in the EMI’s convergence report which is currently being prepared. The importance of these institutional arrangements for creating an appropriate monetary policy setting in Stage Three of EMU cannot be underestimated. The essence of good monetary policy is a sound institutional design and I would like to illustrate this by reference to the following two arguments. First, these arrangements underline the continuity with the experience of those EU central banks with the most successful track record in terms of price stability over the past decades. In fact, in legal terms the ESCB will enjoy an even higher degree of independence than the most independent national central bank at present. Moreover, these legal arrangements are firmly anchored in the Maastricht Treaty and could thus only be changed by a Treaty revision. As you know, this is a very difficult and time-consuming procedure, involving both the European Parliament and all the national parliaments, which thus ensures that such a step is not taken lightly. This brings me to a second point, namely that initially the ECB will have no track record of its own, although it may inherit some of the credibility of the national central banks that are part of it. This implies that financial markets and the general public will assess the performance of the ESCB to a great extent on the basis of the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework adopted and the ability to act in accordance with its primary objective. Taken together, these two arguments make it clear that the independence of the ESCB underpins the credibility and effectiveness of the single monetary policy and is thus a key condition for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Given this legal framework, the Governing Council of the ECB will be able to decide on the basis of its own judgement on the scope and timing of monetary policy actions and how they should be executed. Naturally, in its assessment the Governing Council will take account of a wide range of relevant factors - including the state of the economy in the Monetary Union - but always with the focus on price stability. This does not imply, as is sometimes suggested, that the secondary objective of providing support to the general economic policies in the Community has no real meaning. Nevertheless, under its mandate the ESCB can only pursue this additional goal provided it does not prejudice the primary objective of price stability. Moreover, as said, the best contribution monetary policy can make to a sustainable growth of income and employment is to pursue price stability. Price stability is not inconsistent with these ultimate goals of economic policy, but rather a pre-condition for their achievement on a durable basis. The benefits of central bank independence have also been appreciated in the United Kingdom, with the recent granting of operational independence to the Bank of England. Nonetheless, there is an important difference between the \"operational\" independence of the Bank of England and the type of independence which the ECB will enjoy. The ECB will be free to choose the timing and the extent of adjustment of the relevant instruments, as the Bank of England is now, in order to pursue its objectives. However, the ECB will also be responsible for setting its monetary policy target; while in the United Kingdom the government formulates the objective, which the Bank of England has to pursue.   The ESCB: transparent and communicative   Central bank independence has already proved to be a key institutional ingredient for achieving and maintaining price stability. However, I think that we would all agree that independence needs to be complemented by accountability. As a matter of principle, in a democratic society there is clearly no room for a lack of accountability in public institutions, and the ESCB, being an important public institution, must be accountable. In turn, accountability requires effective communication, since otherwise it would seem difficult, if not impossible, for any central bank to be held properly accountable. I am aware that it has sometimes been argued that there is a so-called \"democratic deficit\" in the current arrangements at an EU level ; that the ESCB will be a powerful, but \"unaccountable\", institution. I disagree with this view. The ESCB cannot afford, any more than existing European central banks, to contemplate the conduct of monetary policy \"in a vacuum\". The ESCB has to be accountable, and this has to be underpinned by a high degree of transparency and an active communications policy. But apart from the democratic duty of the ESCB to be accountable, coherence and being communicative also serve other practical purposes. For instance, well constructed and well explained monetary policies can influence the expectations of private agents, such as trade unions and employers. Market expectations are of importance for the effectiveness of monetary policy measures and clear as well as transparent and predictable policies may enhance and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy. Let me give you an example. If the central bank is known to react to excessive wage demands by raising interest rates, thereby stabilising prices at the cost of a temporary reduction in output and employment, the excessive wage demands may not occur in the first place. Thus, if economic agents understand how the central bank will react, the need for monetary policy measures - and the consequences in terms of foregone output and employment - may be substantially reduced. In addition, coherent and well-explained monetary policies are also needed in order to enable the national authorities to conduct compatible policies. This applies, in particular, to the overall fiscal policy stance in the Monetary Union. Monetary and fiscal co-ordination may be difficult in an environment of unpredictable and poorly understood monetary policies. Although the benefits of transparency and of being communicative are indisputable, the question is how best to organise such a process - and particularly a constructive dialogue with other policy-makers - as well as establish communication links with markets and the general public. The current situation in Member States is that the governor of the national central bank finds a natural sparring-partner in the minister of finance, with whom frequent contacts exist, often on a weekly basis. Sometimes the question is asked, \"who will the governor of the ECB have breakfast or lunch with?\" (referring to the arrangements in the United States and the Netherlands). In the environment of Stage Three, the situation is more complicated, but the Treaty does contain some provisions in this regard. The President of the ECOFIN Council (and also a member of the Commission) may participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, without the right to vote (Article 109b.1). The President of the ECB will be invited to take part in meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB are on the agenda (Article 109b.2). Furthermore, in addition to the national central banks, the ECB will participate with two members in the meetings of the Economic and Financial Council, the successor to the current Monetary Committee. Since the ECOFIN Council also includes delegates of EU countries that do not participate in the single currency, the decision has been taken to establish a forum made up of representatives of participating countries. It is currently called euro-x, until the number of euro countries is known. In view of the fact that the institutional provisions of the Treaty do not mention the creation of a new Community body with restricted membership, such a forum can only exist in an informal capacity. It goes without saying that the statutory independence of the ESCB is not in any way affected by its deliberations. Such a forum may play a role in organising an efficient dialogue between the ECB and national governments of the euro area countries. With regard to the currently envisaged arrangements, the President and the other members of the Executive Board of the ECB, at their own initiative or on request, may also be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament (Article 109b (3)). In October of last year, for instance, I had the pleasure of addressing the members of the Monetary Sub-Committee of the European Parliament on the progress of the move to Stage Three of EMU and the main challenges facing the EMI in the near future. I have already been invited and accepted the invitation, to present the EMI’s convergence report, which will be released on 25 March 1998. In order to facilitate the exchange of views, and to achieve its statutory objectives, it will be necessary for the ESCB to be as transparent as possible in its conduct of monetary policy. In addition to the means already described, the Treaty requires the ECB to publish an annual report covering the single monetary policy and other activities of the ESCB. The President of the ECB presents this annual report to the Council and the European Parliament, which on that basis could subsequently hold a general debate. For a fruitful dialogue with the ESCB it is crucial that its mandate of achieving price stability is respected and that it is acknowledged that it cannot be made responsible for short term employment objectives. Reports on the activities of the ESCB will also be published during the year, at least quarterly, in addition to weekly financial statements. The ESCB will announce a quantified definition of what it understands \"price stability\" to mean in terms of its Treaty obligations. The publication of specific targets for monetary policy, and an explanation for any deviations from the target together with an explanation of the policy response, will facilitate an assessment of its policy performance. This will further add to the transparency of the ESCB and thereby enhance its accountability. All these provisions - to which I may add the expectation that in the future there will also be many speeches to the public and statements to the press - will clearly promote the understanding of monetary policy objectives, intentions and actions. They thereby support the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the same time, the Treaty recognises that the ECB cannot be made responsible for outcomes in terms of inflation month-by-month, since there are lags between a change in the course of monetary policy and its effect on prices. Moreover, in the short term, the inflation outcome may reflect the incidence of certain temporary factors over which the ECB has no control.   Concluding remarks   To conclude, I have set out this evening to provide you with a description of some of the key features of the ESCB, which will be founded three months from now. The ESCB will be a powerful institution. Of that there is no doubt. It will be independent of political influence in pursuing the goal of achieving and maintaining price stability, as delegated to it under the Maastricht Treaty. The preparations and institutional arrangements are in place to enable the ESCB to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability within the euro area. Monetary policy has, therefore, to be conducted and also be assessed in a medium term framework. In the pursuit of its statutory objectives, it has to be an open organisation, so that the policies of the ESCB are clearly understood by national and European political bodies, financial markets and by the general public. The ESCB has to engage in an exchange of views and information with these parties. Ultimately, of course, the ESCB will be held accountable to the general public through its record of achieving price stability. And this accountability has to be underpinned by both the transparency of its monetary policy actions and an effective communications policy.  ']\n",

Duisenberg, President of the EMI,at the Katholieke Universiteit van Leuvenon 5 February 1998', '  EMU and the financial sector   Inaugural lecture to the Leerstoel Generale Bankby Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the EMI,at the Katholieke Universiteit van Leuvenon 5 February 1998 Ladies and gentleman, I am very honoured to be asked to deliver the inaugural lecture of the Generale Bank chair. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with you the current trends affecting the European financial sector and in particular the effects of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The advent of EMU represents new opportunities and challenges for financial institutions and markets. EMU may create a new environment for the production of financial services and become a catalyst for change, providing a \"critical mass\" which will allow progress to be made in financial integration. Nevertheless, Monetary Union will, in many respects, only accelerate current trends. This is the reason why I should like to describe, first, where the European financial sector stands now, before considering the effects of EMU on financial markets and institutions.   1. Current trends in the European financial sector   As I just indicated, I would like to set the stage by describing the current trends affecting the European financial sector. It is useful indeed to summarise briefly the most significant developments in the European financial system in order to give some flavour of the context in which EMU is going to take place. In my view, the European financial sector has been experiencing three major trends: (i) a general movement of deregulation and internationalisation; (ii) significant growth of financial markets, with effects on disintermediation, and (iii) rapid technological changes. Let me review them successively.   1.1 Deregulation and internationalisation   First, in comparison with the very regulated financial systems in Europe inherited from the post-war period, most European countries have been liberalising their financial services industry, beginning in the mid to late 1960s, then more significantly in the 1980s and 1990s. A marked trend towards the privatisation and, in some cases, the demutualisation of financial institutions has also been observable in all countries. At the same time, European countries have progressively opened up their financial markets and institutions to foreign competition. This was partly the consequence of independent national legislation, but also resulted from the dynamics set in train by the Treaty of Rome, which received a new impetus with the Single Market programme. The most significant restrictions on capital movements in the EU were lifted by the mid-1990s. The Second Banking Co-ordination Directive, implemented by 1 January 1993, introduced the single banking licence, which allows credit institutions to establish branches or supply cross-border services to all European Economic Area countries without prior authorisation from the authorities of the particular country. One should also mention the harmonisation in the securities industry under the Investment Services Directive, implemented by 1 January 1996. Earlier, harmonised rules applying to some investment funds were introduced with the UCITS Directive, implemented by 1 October 1989. One indicator of such an evolution is the progressive internationalisation of banking networks. Effectively, the share of foreign branches in banks’ total assets has increased continuously, to reach around 10% of the market for the majority of EU countries. In particular, the opening of banking markets in southern Europe was a major consequence of the Single Market programme. However, if one excludes the particular role of financial centres in countries like Ireland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, the level of internationalisation remains currently lower than in the United States, where foreign penetration is around 30%.   1.2 Growth of securities markets and disintermediation   The second major trend affecting the financial sector is the growth of securities markets. During the last 15 years, in Europe, intermediation between savers and investors has come to rely more on marketable instruments. The ratio of equities, bonds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper outstanding to GDP has increased significantly in most EU countries both absolutely and relative to traditional loans and deposits since the mid-1980s[1]. Another feature of this pattern is the more active role of institutional investors in conjunction with population ageing, which increases the demand for fully funded pension schemes in many EU countries, as well as leading to increased precautionary savings for old age (e.g. via life assurance policies) even when there is a comprehensive social security pension system available. As a consequence, one can observe a trend towards disintermediation - a shift of services or functions away from the traditional loans and services offered by the banking system - even if banks still offer the most important instruments of intermediation in many countries.   1.3 Technological developments   Third, technological innovation is leading to rapid changes in the financial sector, from the point of view of both financial \"processes\" and \"products\". I just want to mention a few examples of progress made in that area which have had effects on competition and performance. Firstly, in organised exchanges, new electronic continuous auction markets have been introduced since the early 1990s, particularly CAC in Paris, IBIS and, recently, XETRA in Frankfurt. Also, in derivatives markets, the Deutsche Termin Börse (DTB) now runs a fully electronic order-driven system with almost one-third of its members trading from workstations outside Germany. MATIF and LIFFE, traditionally specialised in open outcry systems, are currently also developing electronic trading systems. Secondly, in the banking area, the use of the Internet, as well as the development of electronic money are starting to affect the traditional distribution channels. Finally, computer-driven credit scoring systems challenge traditional bank-client relationships by reducing the information advantage of banks. Jointly with securitisation, these advances in information technology have been leading to the \"unbundling\" of banking activities (see Rajan, 1996), in the sense that activities formerly operated by a single bank are now processed by separate financial institutions. This paves the way for the entry into the industry of new players, in particular non-banks. One of the most recent examples is the growth of \"supermarket banking\" (where food retailers offer competitive deposit facilities and an increasing array of other financial services in-house) in the United Kingdom. All these trends are bringing about substantial change in the financial sector, leading to the narrowing of intermediation margins and a reduction in profitability. In such a context, EMU represents new challenges and opportunities that I want now to discuss, considering financial markets and institutions successively.   2. Effects of EMU on financial markets   The Single Currency will have significant effects on financial markets. The most immediate changes will affect the foreign exchange markets. Cross-trades between the currencies participating in Monetary Union, which currently represent about 10% of total transactions, will disappear. Demand for foreign exchange hedging transactions will also experience further reductions, although the bulk of such transactions usually involve the US dollar and should not be affected by EMU. New activities may also emerge, in particular those associated with the use of the euro as a reserve currency, but this will only develop as the euro becomes established. More predictable, though, are the likely effects of EMU on money and securities markets, on which I wish now to focus.   2.1 Money markets   EMU will have very significant effects on the money markets. The single monetary policy will create a new environment, to which the current money markets will have to adapt.   2.1.1 The single monetary policy framework will create a new environment...   The new framework for the implementation of the single monetary policy will create the necessary conditions for the integration of European money markets. First, the technical infrastructure to support a large European money market will be provided by the interlinking of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems through TARGET. Large cross-border payments denominated in euro will therefore be processed as smoothly as if they were domestic payments. Initially designed to carry out the single monetary policy, TARGET might also be available for other kinds of transfers as an alternative to private netting systems (such as the ECU Clearing), mainly at the wholesale level, and should therefore contribute substantially to reducing the kind of systemic dangers to which netting systems are exposed. Second, the ESCB will rely on monetary policy instruments designed to create a deep and liquid money market at the EU level. As indicated in the \"Framework Report\" published in January 1997 by the EMI, and explained in more detail in the so-called \"General Documentation\" published in September 1997, the ESCB will rely on open market operations as well as on standing facilities. The interest rate corridor between the latter (the deposit and the lending facilities) is expected to be relatively wide, although it may depend on the exact parameters chosen by the ESCB. Since these two rates are designed to bound overnight market rates, the likely width of the range means that significant leeway will be left to banks to manage their interest exposure, therefore encouraging market development. The ESCB will also rely on a broad range of counterparties. In addition, the ECB Governing Council might decide to make use of reserve requirements, and the averaging provisions mechanism might be viewed as contributing to increasing the volume of the interbank market. Compared with alternative ways of controlling volatility in the interbank market, reserves with averaging facilities will have the advantage of assigning a central role to market forces and of not requiring the central bank to be frequently in the market. Equal treatment of counterparties and the reliance on market-based policy instruments are consistent with the requirement, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, that the ESCB \"shall act in accordance with the principles of an open market economy with free competition\". One might anticipate that not only the harmonisation effect of the single monetary policy, but also the greater level of competition will progressively reduce arbitrage opportunities linked to liquidity differentials. However, the US case shows that it has not hindered the development of large money markets. In particular, the decision that the ECB will use reverse transactions as the main instrument for implementing monetary policy might provide a strong incentive for the development of an EMU-wide private repo market, where financial and non-financial entities may engage in short-term collateralised refinancing operations for conducting day-to-day treasury management (see Schinasi and Prati (1997)).   2.1.2 ...which will require member countries to adapt   The single monetary policy will, however, require market participants to adapt to the new environment. First, the harmonisation of Monetary Policy Instruments and Procedures (MPIPs) at the start of Stage Three will have an impact on banks’ refinancing. New facilities will be introduced, requiring further adjustment of techniques towards greater use of interventions at market rates in some countries. Of course, some countries have already made some adjustment (such as the use of repos by the Bank of England, development of the short-term money market in Germany) and changes realised in the past did not prove to be too difficult to implement for many countries. For a few other countries, however, the adjustment will be more significant. Second, in order to accommodate differences in financial structures across countries, two tiers of eligible collateral are to be allowed for monetary policy operations: the first one includes instruments that are common to all countries, while the second comprises marketable and non-marketable financial obligations as well as, in some cases, equities traded on a regulated market. In the case of Tier 2, the assets and eligibility criteria are established by each NCB, under ECB guidelines and with its approval. This would, for example, allow the inclusion of a large volume of trade bills and bank loans in Germany and France. It should finally be noted that very significant progress has already been achieved in the direction of the integration of European money markets, as is evidenced by the convergence of monetary policy intervention rates, as well as the nearly identical money market and swap yield curves over the past two years for the Belgian franc, the Deutsche Mark, the Dutch guilder and the French franc regarding maturities from one week to two years.   2.2 Securities markets   EMU will also have an impact on securities markets. First, EMU creates the potential for the emergence of deeper and more liquid financial markets. Second, it will have effects on the nature of products offered. Regarding the size of financial markets, EMU will offer EU countries the opportunity to compete in size with the United States and Japan. The capitalisation of existing (domestic and international) debt securities and equities in the EU-15 area amounted to 12,500 billions dollars at the end of 1995, as compared to 27,000 billions dollars for the US and Japanese markets taken together, on account of the large size of the EU domestic bond markets. The greater depth and liquidity of EU markets after the introduction of the Single Currency, as well as the strength and the stability of the euro, may also attract additional investors from outside the euro area. Regarding the nature of products offered on EU securities markets, EMU may have significant effects. First, one can expect that the disappearance of foreign exchange risk means that credit risk will become more important in relative terms, which may lead to the emergence of a \"credit risk culture\" in the management of debt instruments. While this will be favoured, in particular by the implementation of the \"no bail-out\" clause - which will have an impact on the rating of public debt, in the sense that domestic issues are likely to receive ratings similar to those currently attributed to foreign issues (see BIS (1996)) - fiscal discipline and the strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact should per se reduce credit differentials to a minimum[2]. Of course, a \"credit risk culture\" would also depend on the existence of a system of rating agencies really adapted to the needs of European investors. In countries where banks hold a significant proportion of government bonds (France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg), banks will have to adjust their portfolios in the light of perceived variations in this credit risk. At the same time, the zero credit risk weighting for zone A government debt (which includes all EU countries’ government debt) in the solvency ratio regimes will provide a strong incentive to invest in government bonds. Investors will also pay more attention to the liquidity characteristics of financial markets. Second, one could witness in the very near future the creation of a unified European capital market for prime borrowers. This would include the emergence of a single reference bond yield curve, as well as a European equity market for blue-chip stocks. Such markets would, however, not cover the whole spectrum of issuers, since securities from small and medium-sized companies would probably remain national. The latter compartment of the market will probably remain, to a large extent, separated, since investors’ home bias is likely to remain important, because of asymmetric information, tax differences, or attempts by national centres to protect their market shares. Third, other markets may also develop. The Stability and Growth Pact will, by constraining fiscal policy and imposing limits on government deficits, reduce governments’ recourse to the capital market, hence creating room for other issuers. In addition to population ageing, it will put additional pressures on pay-as-you-go pension systems in favour of funded ones. Non-government bond and equity markets should therefore grow, accelerating the general movement towards disintermediation. In addition, to the extent that the operational framework for monetary policy increases the demand for private paper, it will have an effect on financial market structures, by creating the \"critical mass\" which will allow new products to be sufficiently competitive to expand significantly. This will increase the scope for securitisation; it might even lead to the emergence of a low-grade bond market in addition to the market for prime borrowers. One qualification, however, is that, if securities markets are to expand and become more diversified to compete on an equal basis with the United States, securities settlement systems will have to further improve and develop significantly. Fourth, EMU will also have an impact on derivatives markets. Products linked with short-term interest rates will suffer falls in trading volumes, since the single monetary policy in Stage Three implies that there will be only room for one leading short-term contract. This may have consequences for the 16 European futures or options markets (including Switzerland). As far as long-term contracts are concerned, the coexistence of more than one reference bond market will not be a durable feature, so that one can anticipate either a single contract - although this may imply co-operation between financial centres, as it is currently the case between DTB and MATIF - or several identical ones with similar characteristics (margins, opening hours).   3. Effects oF EMU ON Financial institutions   Financial institutions constitute the backbone of the financial sector. In addition, given the progressive institutionalisation of financial markets, they are the ultimate participants. They will naturally be at the forefront of the changes ushered in by EMU. Following the standard (albeit sometimes criticised) paradigm in industrial economics, namely the Structure-Conduct-Performance approach, I wish to consider now how EMU will affect the nature of financial institutions’ activities and their competitive environment. Then I shall deal with the effects of EMU on the performance of financial institutions.   3.1 EMU changes the nature of financial institutions’ activities and their competitive environment   The single currency as well as the development of deeper financial markets create two challenges for financial institutions. First, it may reinforce securitisation in the \"narrow sense\" as well as in the \"broad sense\" of a growing use of instruments tradable in financial markets. Second, it will intensify competition. EMU is likely to increase the size of securities markets so that securitisation in the \"narrow sense\" - i.e. the transformation of banking assets into tradable securities through financial engineering - will make further progress, offering banks more flexibility in terms of asset/liability management. At the same time, with securitisation in the \"broad sense,\" the competitive disadvantage of traditional bank intermediation vis-à-vis financial markets and non-banks is likely to increase, with differential effects on deposit collection and credit activities. On the deposit side, banks are likely to increasingly face competition from institutional investors. Following the disappearance of foreign exchange risk, limits on portfolio diversification by institutional investors, like the \"currency matching rules\", are likely to be applied only outside the euro area[3]. This will boost the cross-border investment activity of institutional investors. As a consequence of the changing nature of demand, with the greater use of mutual funds, the maturity of banks’ deposit-taking may become shorter and deposit collection more costly. On the asset side, greater competition in the securities business will coexist with the persistence of asymmetric information in lending activities. In the latter case, the need to have a direct link with borrowers means that traditional financial intermediation is likely to remain substantial, in particular lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, for whom access to the securities markets is more difficult. Therefore, EMU represents both challenges and new opportunities, since, in this new environment, institutions currently involved in fee-generating activities, or offering services linked to financial markets, will have a competitive advantage in the faster growing segments of the financial sector. On the other hand, EMU will increase competition among financial institutions. Note that national banking markets are today relatively concentrated, more significantly so in the smaller countries. Against this background, EMU will, by removing the last obstacle to the circulation of financial services across European countries, induce, at least in the first years, a significant increase in competition. Using data provided by IBCA, a rating agency, one can compute an upper bound for the level of concentration of assets, loans and deposits, as measured by the share of the five largest EU credit institutions. Concentration ratios might be between 10 and 11% (between 13 and 14% for universal banks), as compared to 18% in the United States in 1993 (OECD, 1995). This reveals that there may exist some scope for further consolidation in Europe, in continuation of the trend observed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. To assess the overall effect of EMU, it is however useful to distinguish between wholesale and retail markets. Wholesale markets are already significantly internationalised and competitive, but competition in these markets will nevertheless evolve over time. The single currency will imply a further redistribution of banking activities to the extent that competitive advantages, partly based on the existence of national currencies, will disappear. In particular, the \"anchoring principle\" imposed by some central banks and requiring domestic financial institutions to lead manage bond issues will, if maintained, be enlarged to a wider zone, or even disappear[4]. In addition, the main currency-based competitive factor, namely the expertise in the domestic monetary environment will, according to Dermine (1996), disappear. However, other competitive factors are likely to be unaffected by the single currency in the short run. These include the existence of a distribution network of customers, as well as access to information on supply/demand flows, which help to assess the direction of price movements. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, the knowledge of the accounting, legal and fiscal environment also remains an important determinant. However, all these competitive advantages are not irreversible and may be progressively eroded by EMU. In addition, the importance of the size factor (i.e. the cumulative advantage of controlling a large market share, hence the ability to operate on a larger scale) indicates that current positions may be progressively overturned by European or even by other global players. In retail banking markets, EMU will induce further progress in payment systems, both directly and via interaction with technological innovation, the major driving force behind changes in payment systems. For instance, technological innovation may itself be fostered by the transition to the single currency. In particular, the liberalisation of telecommunications, favoured by the Single Market that EMU is due to complete, may lead to a more widespread use of phone, PC and Internet banking. Network-based e-money payments may also benefit from a global and highly competitive market. Changes in competition may therefore be expected to be more pronounced on the liabilities than on the assets side. In particular, remote access to banks in other Member States will become very easy in the context of a single currency and branches may lose their relevance as distribution centres of deposit products. Regarding the assets side, Monetary Union will enable operations in any national market to be financed through deposits obtained in the home country, hence also facilitating the remote supply of financial services. Consequently, competition in some segments of the market is likely to increase. This is the case of activities which are relatively homogeneous and closely related to the deposit function, like consumer credit and standard mortgage loans, as opposed to small-scale commercial loans and specialised consumer loans which require more direct contact with customers. On the other hand, there still exist legal, fiscal and institutional obstacles to full integration that will limit the effects of competition. However, being more visible in the single currency area, they may trigger further pressure, leading to their progressive disappearance.   3.2 EMU may have a significant impact on the performance of the banking industry   The move to EMU offers challenges for financial institutions. While the changeover process imposes constraints in the short run, the medium-term effects on the performance of these institutions will, in my view, certainly be positive.   3.2.1 EMU implies one-off costs associated with the changeover...   One should not deny that the changeover to the euro is a major undertaking which is costly for financial institutions. The changeover scenario agreed in Madrid in December 1995 is designed to minimise costs by adopting a decentralised approach. It is the principle of \"no compulsion, no prohibition\", which allows institutions to choose the most appropriate way and the pace at which they upgrade their operational systems. Costs vary across institutions depending on their activities. While being apparently low for firms active in securities business, costs would be higher for institutions specialised at the retail level, given their role of intermediaries, during Stage Three A (1999-2002), between agents and institutions proceeding at different paces regarding the introduction of the euro. Conversely, securities firms already operate in a multi-currency environment. It is interesting to note that various estimates tend to show that smaller and/or more specialised institutions may not always be disadvantaged, although their lower cost of organisation may in some cases be more than offset by limited expertise. Adequate planning and timing of the changeover seems to make a difference, since some changes are due to be made independently of the advent of EMU, in particular regarding preparations for the year 2000.   3.2.2 ...but the competitiveness of EU financial institutions should increase in the medium run   In the medium run, however, I see the costs of the changeover as a profitable investment for financial institutions. First, in a few instances, the move to Stage Three may help reveal organisational deficiencies at the level of institutions, the solution of which will, in the end, prove decisive in improving the competitiveness of successful European institutions. Similarly, the time-consuming process of the harmonisation of market conventions and codes of practices (day counts, business days, reference rates...) will not only ensure the continuity of operations when moving to Stage Three of EMU and the smooth functioning of the area-wide money market based on the euro, it will also promote the fungibility of instruments across countries, a necessary condition for the creation of deeper financial markets (see the Giovannini Report). Second, institutions will probably gain from returns to scale associated with activities extended to the EU area level, leading to the constitution of global players able to compete with non-euro institutions. One should, however, acknowledge that the economic literature does not provide clear evidence in favour of very significant returns to scale in banking. Similarly, regarding the existence of economies of scope that may justify the existence of large universal banks, the literature is, again, inconclusive. There is, at most, evidence of small gains of joint production for liquidity management, treasury and dealing activities, risk management and payment systems. There is also only anecdotal evidence that returns to scale in money market operations may also imply the concentration of other activities. However, although it is quite speculative to predict how banks will exploit possible returns to scale and react to potential competition, one possible scenario is that EMU will lead to the coexistence of a few Europe-based global players, alongside smaller institutions specialised either in given product groups or in specific regions. It is also difficult to predict which strategy will be preferred by banks after EMU - (1) specialising in specific \"niches\" involving particular skills; (2) building new strategic alliances among universal banks; or (3) accelerating the movement of concentration through mergers and acquisition. Third, from a more macroeconomic point of view, the priority given to price stability in Stage Three should provide an enhanced environment for the production of financial services. Less volatile inflation and interest rates are good for banks’ customers, and hence for banks. They will also benefit from higher expected economic growth via lower interest rates supported by a strong euro. Thus, EMU may increase the competitiveness of the whole European banking industry, and in particular of the international banking groups.   4. Conclusion   EMU will certainly have a major impact on the European financial sector. Of course, all trends currently apparent should not be exclusively explained by the \"EMU factor\". However, the single monetary policy will generate new activities, in particular in connection with the emergence of larger and deeper financial markets. In addition, competition is likely to increase significantly with the single currency, as one of the major obstacles to financial integration will disappear, although retail banking markets will keep, at least at the beginning of EMU, many of their \"local\" features, in particular those due to tax differences. Other speakers in this Lecture Series will come back later to this issue of tax convergence. Let me finish by indicating that the objective of the EMI is to ensure that the move to Stage Three takes place as smoothly as possible. Work to establish the infrastructural support for the conduct of the single monetary policy in areas like payment systems and statistics is broadly complete. The operational framework for monetary policy has been set out in detail. The ECB Governing Council will make the last few necessary adjustments in good time. Market participants are adapting their accounting and operational systems and can now define their strategies. Provided that the supply of financial services is adequately priced ex ante (this would require that all banks do not decide to invest in the same sectors and do not lend imprudently to new customers), I am convinced that financial institutions will soon reap the benefits of EMU.

Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the World Economic Forum Davos, 30 January 1998', '  The role of the future European System of Central Banks   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the World Economic Forum Davos, 30 January 1998  I. Introduction  With the single European currency moving from a distant dream to a virtual certainty, participants of this years\\' Davos World Economic Forum are devoting a considerable amount of time to the evaluation of the various implications of the introduction of the euro. The agenda quite rightly suggests that the start of Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is likely to trigger profound changes to the economic, political and social systems of the participating member states and inside the EU as a whole. Moreover, it is no exaggeration to state that the imminent merger of some European currencies into the euro will rank among the most important events that have influenced the international monetary system during the post-war period.  The closer we come to the starting point, the more people are becoming aware that with the unprecedented simultaneous transfer of monetary sovereignty to an independent, supra-national European System of Central Banks (ESCB) we are entering unchartered waters. But that in itself does not preclude the rationality of the project. It only means that in such an environment great attention must be devoted to the preparatory work in order to avoid the ship running aground and the potential benefits of the expedition being offset.  Obviously, the start of the necessary preparatory work could not await the establishment of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in May 1998. Therefore, a specific transitional body, the European Monetary Institute (EMI), has been set up at the future site of the ECB in Frankfurt in 1994. Its task is, inter alia, to specify the regulatory, organisational and logistical framework necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks right from the start of Stage Three on 1 January 1999. In other words the EMI will provide the draft screenplay which, subject to the approval and amendments by the ECB, will be rehearsed during the second half of 1998. Moreover, the ECB will be able to build on the internal infrastructure of the EMI as the latter goes into liquidation immediately after the establishment of the ESCB.   II. The three roles of the ESCB   The preparations are well under way, facilitated by the fact that the institutional framework for the ESCB enshrined in the Treaty and spelt out in the Statute of the ESCB and the ECB contains very precise rules for the swift and smooth take over as the central bank of the euro area. As this will be the most important role to be played by the ESCB, I shall first concentrate on it. Subsequently, I would like to devote some minutes on the system\\'s functions outside the euro area, acting as an anchor for the monetary and exchange rate policy of the EU Member States not yet participating in the euro area and progressively playing a role on the international monetary stage.   1. The ESCB as the central bank of the euro area    In the dual layer central bank system ...  But before developing these three roles of the ESCB further, it seems to be necessary to briefly introduce you to this new actor on the monetary scene. Whilst the name of the new currency, the euro, is today fairly widely known throughout the European Union, far fewer European citizens can name the central bank responsible for its management. This is certainly also due to the fact that the adopted concept of a dual layer central bank system differs substantially from the organisational structure of most national central banks. The ESCB consists of the national central banks of the Community and - at its decision-making centre - the ECB with the Governing Council as the supreme decision-making body for the euro area.   ... the ECB can effectively and efficiently implement a single monetary policy ...   The decision to opt for a federal system was taken because it corresponds best to the requirements for the new central bank and reduces the overhead to the minimum. With only some 500 staff members, the ECB can serve as a role model for a strong but efficient European administration. What is crucial is that the System will provide a monetary policy as a unified whole. The set of monetary policy instruments and procedures being prepared by the EMI will ensure that the Governing Council of the ECB and - for the day-to-day management - the ECB Executive Board are in a position to control the overall stance of monetary policy at all times, in conformity with the decision-making framework of the ESCB. Decisions will thus always be taken at the ECB level, whereas implementation will, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, be executed in a decentralised manner by the participating national central banks.   ... taking due account to differences between national financial markets ...  Reliance on the infrastructure and operational experience built up by the national central banks will undoubtly prove a valuable asset. The ESCB needs to be cognisant of the historically grown and substantial differences between national financial markets in the EU if it wants to successfully provide a level playing field for a broad range of counterparties throughout the euro area. This holds especially for the foreseeable period of rapid changes in market participants\\' behaviour also triggered by EMU itself.   ... and ensuring the necessary continuity with European central banking experience ...   An additional feature of the ESCB structure is that - despite some important institutional changes - it provides the necessary continuity with European central banking experience. The creation of the ECB follows an evolutionary process which has led to convergent views on the role and functions of monetary policy among central bankers and that conditions not only the structure of the system but also the way it will operate in practice. The progressively closer co-operation of monetary policy authorities during past years will be fostered further following the pre-announcement of the bilateral conversion rates in May 1998. The same Governors who are conducting monetary policy co-operation today will be members of the ECB Governing Council determining the single monetary policy in Stage Three. The ECB as the focal point of best European central bank traditions can inherit the track record of the best performers entering the System.   ... thereby fostering its credibility.  This statement seems to be confirmed by financial markets\\' expectations. Judging from long-term interest rates, market participants seem to be convinced that inflation will remain low in the euro area. Moreover, convergence of long-term interest rates towards the lowest level rather than the average indicates that a credible single monetary policy is expected.   Without any national bias ...   The decentralised structure of the ESCB is not inspired by the principle of subsidiarity which is often quite rightly \"en vogue\" elsewhere in the European integration process. The principle of subsidiarity applies only in areas which do not fall within the Communities\\' exclusive competencies, and is thus not applicable to the ESCB tasks. The national central banks are an integral part of the ESCB and shall act in accordance with the guidelines and instructions of the ECB. Hence, the decentralised modus operandi of the system is based on the assumption that the single monetary policy is best executed locally.   ... the single monetary policy will be implemented...  Moreover, the Governors of the participating central banks will not act as the representatives of their respective country or national central bank, but will act in a personal capacity with a responsibility for the entire euro area. This is, inter alia, reflected in the general voting rule -one person, one vote - which stresses the supra-national character of the ESCB\\'s tasks the most important of which are    to define and implement the monetary policy of the Community with the primary objective of maintaining price stability;      to conduct foreign exchange operations;    to hold and manage the official foreign reserves of the Member States; and    to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.      Outside the framework of the ESCB - and acting as national agencies - national central banks may perform functions other than those specified in this Statute - for instance providing fiscal agent services to the government - unless these interfere with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.   ... with the primary objective of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole.  I do not want to dwell on the crucial importance of the primary objective of maintaining price stabiliy. It is now widely accepted - not only in the central banking community but also in the academic world and among financial market practitioners - that only a monetary policy geared towards price stability can create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. An important element that may be worth mentioning, nevertheless, is that for the ESCB the objective of price stability concerns the whole euro area. It is the price level of the whole euro area that the single monetary policy will aim at stabilising. There will not be, and there could not be, differentiated policies for each region or country in the euro area depending on the prevailing inflationary conditions.   The high degree of independence of the ESCB ...  It is recognised that the ESCB has been granted a high degree of institutional, personal, functional and financial independence, consistent with the desire of the political authorities that signed the Maastricht Treaty to put the ESCB in the best possible position to achieve its primary objective. The Treaty also requires that the Statutes of the national central banks be adapted to conform with that of the ECB. This process is under way and the Statutes of the NCBs, even those that were recognised as being among the most independent, are being upgraded to satisfy the Treaty\\'s requirements.   ... does not preclude good co-operation ...  However, a high degree of independence will and should not seduce the ESCB into enclosing itself in an \"ivory Eurotower\", therebyalso running the risk of violating its second objective established by the Treaty which is - \"without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability - to support the general economic policies of the Community.\" The harmonious economic development of the Community in Stage Three will call for a fruitful dialogue between the ECOFIN Council - which is at the centre of the economic decision-making process for the Union - and the ECB as the body responsible for the monetary policy of the single currency area.  The Maastricht Treaty already provides for a number of formal communication channels between both, for instance the Economic and Financial Committee, bringing together senior officials from the national central banks and the ECB as well as from the finance ministries. In addition, I would like to mention the right of the President of the ECOFIN Council and a member of the European Commission to participate - without having the right to vote - in meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Treaty provides in turn for the ECB President to attend ECOFIN Council meetings when it discusses matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB. Moreover, last month, in a resolution on economic policy co-ordination in Stage Three of EMU it was agreed that the finance ministers of the States participating in the euro area will meet informally - as the so-called Euro X - to discuss related issues with the participation, when appropriate, of the ECB.  Formal and informal communication channels enabling both sides to explain to one another the policy actions for which they are respectively responsible are fully compatible with the independence of the ESCB. Moreover, they can prove very helpful for the participating member states to find the appropriate fiscal policy stance vis-à-vis a single monetary policy which, by definition, cannot accommodate specific national needs. I therefore very much appreciate that the European Council acknowledged the specific responsibilities of the member states of the euro area for the single currency. This will be helpful in order to avoid the ECB becoming a scapegoat for a wrong policy mix at an individual national level.   ... and the necessary accountability via-à-vis the EU-Institutions ...  The Treaty also provides for a comprehensive list of reporting commitments. The ECB shall address an annual report on the activities of the ESCB and on the monetary policy of both the previous and the current year to the European Parliament, the EU Council, the European Commission and the European Council. On the basis of that report, the European Parliament may hold a general debate. In addition, the ECB President and the other members of the ECB Executive Board may, at the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament. These reporting lines vis-à-vis EU institutions do not preclude the maintainance of well-established communication channels at national level. However, the respective political bodies involved should respect the fact, that in the EMU environment \"their\" central bank governor now has a responsibility for the whole euro area.   ... and ultimately the European people.  Beyond these very precise reporting procedures one should not overlook the fact that, ultimately, the ESCB will be accountable to the European citizens on its ability to defend the purchasing power of their money holdings. If the ESCB does not perform a good job with respect to its primary objective, it will be penalised by the citizens, as savers, who will reduce their holdings of money balances in euro and ask for higher returns to compensate for the depreciation of their currency. The stability of the euro is the ultimate judgement of savers on the performance of the central bank. Communication with the general public will, therefore, involve the public announcement of a quantified definition of what the ESCB understands to be price stability; the publication of specific targets and details of their derivation - against which its policy performance can be assessed; and the explanation of deviations from the target and concomitant policy responses by the ESCB. This will increase the transparency of the ESCB\\'s actions and thereby enhance its accountability. The ESCB should be as transparant as possible.   2. The ESCB providing an anchor for the \"pre-ins\"  Let me now briefly turn an eye on the external tasks of the ESCB, starting with its role as the anchor for the monetary and exchange rate policy of the Member States not yet participating in Stage Three of EMU, the so called \"pre-ins\". Not all EU Member States will initially participate in the euro area. Some have opted out - hopefully only for a relative short period of time; others might not yet have reached the necessary degree of economic convergence. In this context the question arises how the ESCB can help to avoid a division between those participating in the euro area and those outside giving rise to foreign exchange movements which could potentially endanger the internal market.  I would like, first, to remind you that, except formally for the two opt-out countries, the Treaty establishes a political commitment for all EU countries to join the euro area and to adopt policies consistent with this aim. In particular, in stipulating that member states with a derogation shall continue to treat their exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest the Treaty provides for a further means for avoiding that exchange rate developments create distortions within the EU. This, by itself, will create a strong drive towards adopting sustainable economic policies that ensure stability and macroeconomic convergence. In this respect, the creation of the euro represents a catalyst, a force of attraction, that should foster stability also in the other EU countries.  In addition, the Treaty foresees a number of explicit mechanisms for monitoring and co-ordinating Member States\\' economic policies in which the ESCB is involved. Such co-ordination aims at promoting economic convergence, thereby contributing to exchange rate stability.  The third decision-making body of the ECB - the General Council - which includes the Governors of the central banks not initially participating in the euro area, will serve as an appropriate forum within the ESCB to discuss related issues and to monitor the functioning of the new exchange rate mechanism between the euro and the currencies of the other EU countries. This so-called ERM2 has been designed in order to supplement the aforementioned Treaty provisions and should - like a powerhouse - help current and future EU Member States to find their course to adopt the euro. As regards the main features of the system, I would only like to stress, that if they were to be in conflict with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, the ECB could suspend automatic interventions at the margins and that the ECB, too, will have the right to initiate a confidential procedure aimed at reconsidering central rates.   3. The ESCB becoming a major actor on the international monetary stage  The ESCB will play its role inside the EU, with of course extra-european repercussions. The international dimension of the euro and its potential as a major reserve and transaction currency are certainly more than a detail of EMU. I am convinced that, in the long run, a stable euro will prove to be an attractive investment opportunity. However, the valuation of a currency by the financial markets as expressed in the exchange rate cannot be administered but should be seen as the outcome of all other economic policies. Recent experience has repeatedly shown that exchange rate policies that are out of line with economic fundamentals eventually end in a major set-back with negative consequences for the ability of the country in question to attract international investors for quite some time.  Article 109 of the Treaty, which deals with the external policies of EMU, provides some safety precautions against such failures which were spelt out further in the Resolution of the European Council meeting in Luxembourg one month ago. According to this Resolution, the Council may only under exceptional circumstances formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to non-EU currencies. These orientations will always have to respect the independence of the ESCB and be consistent with its primary objective of maintaining price stability.  According to the Treaty, the competence to represent the Community internationally should follow the internal allocation of responsibilities for monetary, exhange rate and economic policy between the ESCB, the Council and the national Member States, respectively. However, representation in international organisations has to take account of those organisations\\' rules. Hence, many issues such as the ESCB\\'s representation in the International Monetary Fund - where membership is confined to individual states and not open for the group of euro area countries as such - still have to be clarified.  The ECB for its part will be well equipped to ensure that the euro area speaks consistently with one voice, which is a major asset in international fora.   III. Conclusion  In conclusion, I am confident that the ESCB in conjunction with the other elements of a stability-orientated policy framework outside the realm of monetary policy - especially the strict implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact with its accompanying Council Regulations - will act as a credible guardian of a stable euro, a reliable anchor for future participating countries, and thereby will contribute to the stabilisation of the international monetary scene./.

      "['1998-01-22', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'EMU - How to grasp the opportunities and avoid the risks', \"Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Forum de l'Expansion Paris, 22 January 1998\", '  EMU - How to grasp the opportunities and avoid the risks   Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Forum de l\\'Expansion Paris, 22 January 1998      Introduction    It is a great pleasure for me to speak to you about Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) which is a unique enterprise that provides a broad range of promising opportunities. The benefits of a single currency are by now well known, On the other hand, as with any such undertaking, Monetary Union also involves some risks. However, I am convinced that the risks can be contained, if not fully avoided, by a high degree of sustainable convergence of those countries which participate in Monetary Union, by a single monetary policy which strictly aims at price stability in the euro area as a whole, by stability-oriented economic and fiscal policies and by sound wage developments in Stage Three.. If all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, the chances far outweigh the risks - or, in other words, the net benefits to be expected from EMU are clearly positive. It is of utmost importance for the success of Monetary Union that a high degree of convergence be achieved for the participating countries. The dangers of there being a lack of convergence at the start of EMU are obvious. In particular, if national fiscal positions are not under control from the outset, the single monetary policy may be overburdened and adverse spillover effects may arise within the Monetary Union as a whole, and thus also for those countries whose fiscal policies are under control. I should like to address the issue of what monetary policy, but also other areas of economic policy, in particular those responsible for fiscal and labour market developments, can contribute to grasping the opportunities and avoiding the risks of EMU.      The contribution of monetary policy: maintaining price stability    First, the most important contribution that the ESCB can make towards exploiting to the maximum the opportunities and avoiding the risks of EMU is to fulfil its primary objective to maintain price stability. Given the considerable lags between monetary policy measures and price developments, policy decisions directed at price stability must inevitably be both forward-looking in their formulation and pre-emptive in their implementation. This implies that the ESCB will have to take appropriate and timely action to ensure that the final objective is achieved. Therefore, it will have to carry out a thorough and broad analysis of all economic developments - in the euro area and beyond - which could potentially endanger current or future price stability. To achieve this goal, the ESCB will also express its views on other policy areas which can potentially have an impact on its primary objective of price stability. Consequently, the ESCB will try to convince both policy-makers and the general public of the advantages of stability-oriented budgetary policies, of moderate wage developments and of structural reforms which make labour and product markets more responsive to economic signals. Second, a high degree of credibility of the single monetary policy will certainly further heighten the advantages associated with an environment of stable prices. Credibility can be enhanced by the transparency of the monetary policy strategy - whichever strategy the ESCB will finally adopt - and by a policy which leaves no doubt regarding its determination to keep prices stable. In this context, it should be taken into account that given the long lags of monetary policy measures, the monetary stance in the current year will already have a significant impact on price developments in 1999 and beyond. Thus, current national monetary policies, in particular in the second half of this year, will de facto be responsible for ensuring price stability in the euro area in the initial phase of Stage Three, which is of crucial importance for the credibility and reputation of the ESCB. To achieve this aim in a consistent and effective way, co-ordination in the conduct of national monetary policies will have to be intensified further once the selection of the participants in Monetary Union has been carried out. The independence of the ESCB, as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, is a key factor in ensuring a high level of credibility of monetary policy geared to price stability. Therefore, it is of great importance that there is no doubt that the European Council clearly supports the independence of the ESCB. In its Resolution of last December the European Council states that only in exceptional circumstances may the Council formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to non-EU currencies. Moreover, the European Council points out that \"these general orientations should always respect the independence of the ESCB and be consistent with the primary objective of price stability\" and also that the dialogue between the Council and the ECB should respect all aspects of the independence of the ESCB. Third, it should be emphasised that the single monetary policy has to focus on the euro area as a whole. This implies that product and labour markets should be more flexible in Stage Three than was needed before to absorb the impact of regional shocks. I will come back to this issue later in my presentation. Fourth, accountability and transparency are important principles for the ESCB. Accordingly, the Governing Council of the ECB should be in a position to inform the general public in detail about its strategy and the rationale for its decisions.. This should stabilise inflationary expectations at a low level and, thus, enhance the advantages of EMU. Therefore, the ESCB will publish a quantified definition of the final objective of price stability and the specific targets against which the public can assess the ESCB\\'s performance. Regarding the former, it would be fair to say that a rate of consumer price inflation not exceeding 2% is probably close to a level with which central banks would normally be quite satisfied. Moreover, when explaining the general monetary policy strategy to the public, the ESCB will make clear what the single monetary policy can and cannot achieve, and how other areas of economic policies can support monetary policy and thereby enhance the benefits associated with price stability. This should also contribute to avoiding illusions and overly optimistic expectations regarding the direct contribution of EMU to resolving the problems of high unemployment and overburdened social security systems. Furthermore, one may argue that Article 105.1 of the Treaty gives the ESCB the opportunity, if not the obligation, to support the general economic policies in the Community also by giving appropriate advice to those responsible for these policies and that this advice should be given with a view to supporting price stability and an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources. Moreover, to the extent that price stability has been firmly established, the ESCB will implement its monetary policy with a view to supporting the realisation of other economic policy goals, to the extent that this does not endanger future price stability.      The contributions of fiscal and labour market policies: achieving a balanced policy mix    For the monetary policy decisions of the ESCB to be well-informed and, thus, optimal with respect to its objectives, there is evidently a need for regular dialogue and an exchange of information with third parties on issues of common interest. This will apply in particular to national economic policies, wage developments and the overall fiscal policy stance in the Monetary Union. This dialogue may also contribute to improving the economic environment of the single monetary policy and, thereby, the chances of achieving a balanced policy mix, i.e. of maintaining price stability without the need to adopt restrictive monetary policy measures.. Clearly, the dialogue will have to be conducted in such a way as to avoid any interference with the independence of the ESCB and the primary objective of price stability. I have already mentioned that the full benefits of the single currency will not come quasi-automatically with a monetary policy geared towards price stability, but only if there is appropriate support from other economic policies, especially fiscal and wage policies, and if structural reforms are carried out in these areas. Thus, price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for grasping all the opportunities of EMU. Therefore, I would now invite you to have a brief look at the possible contribution of these policy areas towards ensuring that the potential benefits of EMU are fully realised and that the risks are minimised. The ESCB may be forced to tighten its policy stance in order to keep prices stable, if it is confronted with inflationary budgetary policies and wage developments. In this case, there may be transitory losses in terms of economic activity and employment in the whole euro area and, thus, the overall benefits of EMU may be diminished. However, given that the ESCB, according to the Treaty, has the obligation to maintain price stability, those economic policies which threaten price stability should ultimately be regarded as responsible for this undesirable result. How can this risk be avoided? It should be emphasised that a monetary policy which tolerated the inflationary impulse would not improve the situation - on the contrary, it would very likely lead to higher interest rates, increasing further the long-term risks to growth and employment creation. Thus, the only solution seems to be for all areas of economic policy to try to contribute to stable prices and, especially, to avoid measures which worsen inflation prospects. In this context, I appreciate that the European Council obviously takes this issue very seriously. The Luxembourg European Council based its agreement on economic policy co-ordination in Stage Three of EMU on the fact that national economic developments can have an impact on inflation prospects in the euro area as a whole and, thereby, will influence monetary conditions in this area [1]. Thus, inflationary pressures stemming from national policies in some countries could have negative consequences for other parts of the euro area. Economic policy co-ordination should help to avoid such negative spill-over effects. As already indicated, in Stage Three national authorities will face a new environment, characterised by the Stability and Growth Pact, by the permanent prohibition of monetary financing of the government deficit, by the inability of monetary and exchange rate policy to react to purely country-specific shocks, and by the likely - but difficult to predict - changes in the shape of financial markets following the introduction of the single currency. Moreover, there will be a strengthened economic co-ordination among Member States in Stage Three [2]. The significance of these changes, of course, may vary across countries, depending on the institutional environments and fiscal conditions as well as on the monetary and fiscal policy strategies prevailing in Stage Two. This new environment, in particular the Stability and Growth Pact, will provide a good basis for sound public finances and should help to further reduce government deficits. However, there are still some problems and risks, in particular as some countries may start with a deficit of close to 3%. In the case of an economic downturn in one or more of these countries, this would imply either a substantial constraint on automatic stabilisers or the risk of breaching the reference value. Thus, it is important to reduce deficits further to levels close to balance or in surplus. This is not only required by the Stability and Growth Pact, but also by economic rationality and by the need to avoid an overburdening of younger and future generations. Moreover, in Stage Three of EMU the option of using monetary and exchange rate policy in the event of country-specific problems in the real or the financial sector, including overly high labour costs, or with the aim of reducing the burden of financing a high level of government debt will no longer be available. To be sure, such monetary policy strategies did not and do not solve the underlying economic problems. However, by producing transitory improvements in economic conditions or by giving some relief to certain sectors which are in trouble, they sometimes allowed authorities to postpone the necessary and urgent reforms and policy measures. This will no longer be possible in Stage Three. The absence of a monetary policy oriented to the economic situation in individual member countries puts even greater premium on removing rigidities, particularly in product and labour markets. These markets should be flexible enough to allow wages and prices to be adjusted quickly. Such flexibility would be needed to avoid increased unemployment should local economic conditions worsen - due, for example, to an asymmetric shock or a relatively weak local productivity increase. Sufficient flexibility of national wages and prices could also be required if increases in indirect taxes and regulated prices were to contribute to rising area-wide inflationary pressures. In addition, national budgets should allow for sufficient room for manoeuvre to enable automatic stabilisers to work, while respecting the deficit limits of the Stability and Growth Pact. Unemployment in most EU countries, though showing signs of stabilising, remains unacceptably high. As the bulk of EU unemployment is of a structural rather than of a cyclical nature, the key factors for securing existing jobs and creating productive new employment opportunities are continued moderation in wages, lower overall taxes and social security contributions and a reduction in structural rigidities in labour and product markets. The prevailing structure of social security contributions, taxes and transfer payments in a number of EU Member States sometimes cause disincentives for employers to create new jobs. Labour market and fiscal reforms can contribute to increasing the incentives and the scope to create and offer new productive jobs. While such policies and structural reforms would support price stability and increase the benefits of EMU, they normally do not deliver employment miracles in the short-run. Their positive impact on employment will be stronger and quicker, if they are decisive and credible and if the private sector can be convinced that they will be sustained in the long-run. Under certain conditions as for example cost neutrality a policy of shortening working hours may also be an element in employment policies. I know and understand that it is sometimes rather difficult to implement structural reforms. Nevertheless, they are needed to reduce unemployment, independently of EMU. However, EMU makes them even more urgent and indispensable.      Conclusion    To conclude, Monetary Union provides the great opportunity to create and maintain a large zone of price stability in Europe. However, while price stability is a necessary conditions for fully grasping the opportunities of EMU, it is not in itself sufficient. I am confident that policy-makers in all areas are determined to take the new environment of Stage Three and its consequences appropriately into account when forming their policies. Monetary Union, in this sense, offers the great opportunity to substantially improve living conditions in the medium-run. However, as I have explained, these gains will not come as a quasi automatic benefit of EMU. As regards the mandate of the ESCB to maintain price stability, I am convinced that the application of the convergence criteria and the institutional arrangements laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact will guarantee that the ESCB will be a powerful institution which will ensure that the euro will be a stable currency.      [1] See \"Resolution of the European Council on economic policy co-ordination in Stage 3 of EMU and on Treaty Articles 109 and 109b\" adopted last December in Luxembourg. The Resolution emphasises in its first Article that \"to the extent that national economic developments have an impact on inflation prospects in the euro area, ... they will influence monetary conditions in this area\". The European Council regards this as the \"basic reason that the move to a single currency will require closer Community surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies among euro-area Member States.\"    [2] \"This was agreed by the European Council in Luxembourg : \"..strengthened economic co-ordination among States which will be sharing a single currency and between those States and States which will not yet be in a position to participate in the euro\".

Duisenberg (Hong Kong, 19 January 1998)', '  EMU: many countries - one monetary system   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg (Hong Kong, 19 January 1998) Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, etc.  I have great pleasure in being in Hong Kong once again to address issues concerning European Economic and Monetary Union.   1. Introduction        Since the last time I was here - on the occasion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank\\'s annual meeting - two developments have taken place.  In Europe preparations for EMU have continued unabated: at the latest European Councils - held on 22 November and on 12 and 13 December - the Heads of State or Government approved common lines for coherent employment creation policies and finalised an agreement on the co-ordination of economic policies in the European Union after the start of EMU and on the dialogue between the Council of Ministers and the European Central Bank.  In parallel a severe financial crisis has shaken the economies of some countries in Asia - requiring the mobilisation of international multilateral support under the aegis of the IMF for Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. In other countries of the region the authorities have intervened repeatedly in order to re-establish confidence in the stability of their banking and financial systems.  Although the main impact of the financial turbulence in Asia will be felt in Asian countries, the rest of the world will also be affected. This underscores the importance of the Asian economies and their share in the globalisation process. However, the prospect that EMU will start in January 1999 remains unaltered. This prospect is underpinned by a low level of inflation and by renewed progress towards convergence - also in the domain of public finances, where further consolidation is nevertheless required.  While not disregarding international developments, in particular those in this part of the globe, I shall concentrate my address today on illustrating how the EU countries are building a common monetary system which is almost the opposite of your situation, where two monetary systems exist in one country. I should like to address the process by which EMU is being established, focusing specifically on three aspects: first, the technical preparations for the introduction of the single currency - the euro; second, the management and the conduct of the single monetary policy by a European System of Central Banks (the ESCB, which will consist of the European Central Bank (the ECB) and the national central banks of the EU Member States); and, third, the elaboration of economic policies in the EU after 1999.   2. Organising the transition to the single currency         2.1 The procedure in 1998  In a report to be published on 25 March, the EMI will make public its analysis of the progress made by individual Member States in terms of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of a number of criteria. In parallel the European Commission will publish its own report and formulate a recommendation based on the outcome of the report. The EMI\\'s and the European Commission\\'s reports, which will be released simultaneously, will guide the Council of Ministers - composed of the Finance Ministers of the EU Member States - in drawing up its recommendation to the European Council - composed of the Heads of State or Government - on which Member States are ready to adopt the single currency from the beginning of 1999. The European Parliament will be consulted on the matter and will forward its opinion to the European Council. I do not want to dwell on this topic today. I can only observe that many countries have already reaped some of the benefits they were expecting from participation in EMU: low inflation, lower interest rates and reduced exchange rate volatility.  The Heads of State or Government will select the Member States eligible to participate in the first round of EMU during the first weekend of May of this year. Thereafter, the Executive Board of the ECB will be appointed and the ESCB will be established. The Executive Board will consist of the President and Vice-President, plus up to four executive directors. The ESCB will carry out, in the period lasting until 1 January 1999 (the so-called interim period), the adoption and testing of the monetary policy framework prepared over the past few years. Economic and Monetary Union will start on 1 January 1999. In the interim period, monetary policy will remain a national responsibility, but the monetary policies of the individual Member States will become increasingly co-ordinated. The bilateral exchange rates between the participating currencies - which will be used for determining the euro conversion rates - will be pre-announced on the date of the selection of the first countries to participate. On the eve of EMU, the rates at which the participating currencies will be irrevocably converted into euro will be fixed. One euro will then be equal to one ECU at that point in time. Euro conversion rates cannot be pre-announced owing to the Treaty requirement that one ECU will be equal to one euro at the start of EMU. The ECU is a basket currency, also comprising currencies which will not be converted into euro, such as the pound sterling. The euro will not be a basket currency, but a normal currency just as the Deutsche Mark and the US dollar are today.   2.2 The changeover in 1999-2001  The organisation of the transition to the single currency has been a complex and demanding exercise, as the authorities have had to strike a balance between two different and sometimes conflicting demands: a common framework for the single currency area as a whole, as defined in Madrid in December 1995, and the need to provide scope for adaptation to differing national environments. A three-year transitional period is envisaged.  From the start of the three-year transitional period, the lawful currency of the European Union will be the euro, issued by the ESCB. The national currencies of the participating Member States will legally be equivalent to non-decimal subdivisions of the euro. The ESCB will operate exclusively in euro from the very start of EMU. New marketable public debt will also be issued exclusively in euro. For the rest, public and private agents will be able to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to use the new or the old currency denominations, which will in any case be irrevocably linked together. The euro will assume the appearance of the national monetary tokens. This means that fiduciary retail payments will continue to be mainly in banknotes denominated in national currencies.  Legal certainty will be guaranteed by a common legal framework which has been agreed at the European level. This framework establishes the principle of the continuity of contracts, thereby preventing any contractual party from refusing to perform outstanding obligations for the simple reason that EMU has entered into force.  Similar legal amendments in relation to the continuity of contracts and the euro have already been enacted in the United States, e.g. in the State of New York, the State of Illinois and in the State of California.  This common framework has been supplemented by a host of preparations at the national level, which encompass all economic sectors. I shall refer only to some of the most significant developments:  - the governments of most Member States have published national changeover schemes which have been validated by committees and other planning bodies consisting of representatives of all sectors of the economy. In some cases, draft laws have been presented to or already approved by parliaments;  - all Member States intend to redenominate outstanding public debt in euro at the start of Stage Three, that is to say three years before the date by which secondary markets for bonds are to change over to the euro;  - industry associations and institutions linked to the financial markets have been preparing for the complete integration of financial markets.  In summary, Member States have been given considerable leeway in the area of changeover preparations to implement different strategies for the introduction of the single currency. However, a competition-led process of mutual emulation has brought most public and private entities to similar conclusions. The developments I have just described highlight the intention of the great majority of public authorities and market participants throughout the EU to accelerate the pace of the changeover to the euro. The preparatory work for the euro is seen as a golden opportunity to upgrade the services provided by the public sector and to increase the efficiency of the financial system.   2.3 Developments after 1 January 2002  As from 1 January 2002, euro banknotes and coins will be introduced in all the Member States participating in Economic and Monetary Union at the same time. However, each Member State has the right to determine the pace of the cash changeover in its economy, provided it is completed by the middle of that year, i.e. end-June 2002. From that point onwards, only the euro will be in use as the national unit of account and means of payment in the participating countries of the Economic and Monetary Union and national currencies will no longer have legal tender status.   3. The single currency of Europe as a symbol of unity  I should now like to turn to the management and conduct of monetary policy once Economic and Monetary Union has been launched in January 1999.   3.1 Decision-making bodies and the decision-making process in the euro area  The monetary policy decisions will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB by simple majority. The Governing Council will be composed of the President and Vice-President, the other members of the Executive Board and the governors of the national central banks of the participating countries. Each member of the Governing Council will have a single vote. The execution of policy decisions will to a large extent be decentralised and rely on the infrastructure of the national central banks.   3.2 The ECB as guarantor of a stable euro  From the first day of Economic and Monetary Union, national central banks will transfer their monetary policy competencies to the ESCB, which will have the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and thus be the guarantor of a stable euro.   3.3 Strategy and instruments for the conduct of the single monetary policy  The EMI has published material in which it recommends two possible monetary policy strategies for the ECB to consider: monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. The final decision on which one - or on which combination - of the two strategies to adopt will need to be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB in 1998.  In its theoretical description, monetary targeting involves the central bank choosing a monetary aggregate as its intermediate target and deciding its monetary policy actions solely on the basis of comparisons between the target and actual monetary developments. By contrast, an inflation targeting strategy aims at directly steering the final target variable, the inflation rate, without the use of a separate intermediate target variable. Monetary policy actions are based on a comparison between the target for inflation and the forecast inflation rate.  The practical differences between these two theoretically distinct strategies are not so great and their application in different countries has shown that several variants integrating elements of both strategies may exist. Both strategies are based on the same final objective, price stability; they are forward-looking, and they employ a wide range of indicators to assess the appropriateness of the stance of monetary policy.  To achieve price stability, the ESCB will use a number of monetary policy instruments within the context of the chosen monetary policy strategy.  The EMI has already published a blueprint for the monetary policy instruments of the ECB. These will mainly comprise open market operations, supplemented by two standing facilities which will provide a ceiling and a floor to the corridor of official interest rates. Whether or not, in addition, use will be made of minimum reserve requirements remains to be decided by the Governing Council of the ECB.  The EMI has not recommended an exchange rate objective as an appropriate monetary policy strategy for the ECB, given that for an area potentially as large as the euro area, such an approach might be inconsistent with the internal goal of price stability. The external value of the euro will thus mainly be an outcome of the ECB\\'s monetary policy.  This is not to say, however, that the euro area will totally disregard exchange rates. The Treaty on European Union provides for the possible conclusion of formal exchange rate arrangements with non-EU countries. It is unlikely that such arrangements will be made in the foreseeable future. The Treaty also provides for the formulation of general exchange rate orientations vis-à-vis non-EU currencies. But it has already been agreed that these will be resorted to in exceptional circumstances only and in any event without prejudice to the ESCB\\'s primary objective of maintaining price stability. The ESCB will also have the technical capacity to conduct intervention operations in order to counteract excessive or erratic fluctuations of the euro against the major non-EU currencies. In addition, the ESCB will be a party to the so-called ERM II arrangement, the successor to the current EMS, under which EU Member States which have not yet adopted the euro will manage their exchange rate against the euro.   3.4 The international role of the euro  There is no doubt that the creation of a single currency area will transform the international monetary landscape. Academics seem to be divided between those who expect the birth of a European monetary pole to contribute to more stable international exchange rate relations and those who anticipate increased volatility in the medium term in the foreign exchange markets. As the European economy will be characterised by stable low inflation and sustainable fiscal policies in the Member States, there is no a priori reason to expect increased exchange rate volatility; indeed, one could even expect the contrary. By conducting similar policies in all major industrial countries, one of the pre-conditions for a stable international monetary system will be in place.  The euro can be expected to become a major international currency, not only because it will be the currency of a large area but also because it is based on monetary and fiscal policy driven by the objective of stability. However, the international role of the euro will probably develop gradually.         4. Economic policy in EMU and some challenges        I should now like to address the question of how economic policy will be conducted in the European Union as from the start of Economic and Monetary Union.   4.1 The other components of a stability-oriented economic framework  Since EMU is not only about monetary union but also about economic union, it is evident that national economic policies cannot be conducted with total disregard to their potential spillover effects on neighbouring countries. On the other hand, economic union does not require a supranational decision-making on economic policies, and the Treaty clearly reflects this distinction between the monetary and the economic arrangements in Stage Three. This being said, there must be common institutional procedures to enable crucial issues of economic policy, almost - by definition - of common concern in the EU, to be raised and resolved at the Community level. Such procedures were already provided for in the Treaty and put into practice, but with the advent of Monetary Union they will need to be strengthened. I should like to highlight three such procedures.  The first mechanism is the formulation of broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Community, as stipulated in Article 103 of the Treaty. Monetary Union will inevitably create greater interdependence between the participating countries as well as the other EU countries bordering on the euro area. It is thus reasonable to assume that governments will feel the need to hold joint discussions and formulate economic orientations. The recent conclusions drawn by the European Council in Luxembourg (on 12 and 13 December 1997) confirm that the ECOFIN Council, which is the Council of all fifteen EU Finance Ministers, will be the centre of co-ordination for Member States\\' economic policies.  A second instrument is the so-called \"Stability and Growth Pact\", the terms of which were agreed at the Amsterdam Council of 16 and 17 June 1997. The Pact, which builds on and refines rules already laid down in the Treaty on the joint surveillance of economic developments (Article 102, paragraph 3) and joint EU procedures in the event of an excessive deficit in one or more Member States (Article 103), contains a shared goal for Member States - namely that of bringing government budgets in the medium term close to balance or even into surplus and to take corrective action to avoid excessive budgetary deficits. In this way, it will be possible to let the automatic stabilisers work, without causing public deficits and debt levels to increase and reach unsustainable levels.  A third element is what has been coined the \"Euro-x\" Council, which will informally gather the Finance Ministers of the Member States of the euro area for discussions on issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency. The Commission, and the ECB when appropriate, will be invited to take part in these meetings. Whenever matters of common EU-wide interest emerge, they will normally be discussed within the ECOFIN Council.  Other policy rules firmly enshrined in the Treaty with a disciplining effect on the behaviour of groups and institutions in the governmental area should not be overlooked: the prohibition on extending central bank credit to governmental institutions; the ban on any form of preferential access to credit by the public sector; and the \"no bail-out clause\", which prevents the transfer of one government\\'s liabilities to the Community or to other Member States.    4.2 The most frequent objections from economists overseas: the lack of a federal budget of the EU and insufficient labour mobility across national borders  Insufficient mobility of the labour force across the euro area is seen by some academics as a serious cause for concern for the longer-term viability of Economic and Monetary Union. Other compensatory mechanisms - such as large-scale financial transfers to the affected country or countries - will also be ruled out in Europe given that the budget of the Community will be very small.  But the existence of the Stability and Growth Pact leads to the conclusion that EMU does not need a centralised budget. With national budget positions close to balance or in surplus, countries have ample room for manoeuvre to cope with adverse economic developments.  Certainly, Europe requires more market flexibility to better ensure adjustments in EMU. However, labour market flexibility is required independently of EMU. The current excessive level of unemployment cannot be solved unless major structural reforms, especially in the labour markets, are implemented. That which is needed to make EMU work is also required in order to reduce unemployment in Europe. It is important to underline that the introduction of the euro, although in itself an important step in the further economic integration of Europe, will not - and cannot - solve all the problems and needs to be accompanied by other policies.   5. Conclusion  European integration has always been an evolutionary process.  Economic and Monetary Union in Europe is a further step in this process.  The euro will be a stable currency and, as such, it may become a symbol of unity and shared values among Europeans. As the destinies of the peoples of the world become increasingly interdependent, the experience gained from European integration may be useful to all.   ']\n",

A three-year transitional period is envisaged.  From the start of the three-year transitional period, the lawful currency of the European Union will be the euro, issued by the ESCB. The national currencies of the participating Member States will legally be equivalent to non-decimal subdivisions of the euro. The ESCB will operate exclusively in euro from the very start of EMU. New marketable public debt will also be issued exclusively in euro. For the rest, public and private agents will be able to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to use the new or the old currency denominations, which will in any case be irrevocably linked together. The euro will assume the appearance of the national monetary tokens. This means that fiduciary retail payments will continue to be mainly in banknotes denominated in national currencies.  Legal certainty will be guaranteed by a common legal framework which has been agreed at the European level. This framework establishes the principle of the continuity of contracts, thereby preventing any contractual party from refusing to perform outstanding obligations for the simple reason that EMU has entered into force.  Similar legal amendments in relation to the continuity of contracts and the euro have already been enacted in the United States, e.g. in the State of New York, the State of Illinois and in the State of California.  This common framework has been supplemented by a host of preparations at the national level, which encompass all economic sectors. I shall refer only to some of the most significant developments:     the governments of most Member States have published national changeover schemes which have been validated by committees and other planning bodies consisting of representatives of all sectors of the economy. In some cases, draft laws have been presented to or already approved by parliaments;    all Member States intend to redenominate outstanding public debt in euro at the start of Stage Three, that is to say three years before the date by which secondary markets for bonds are to change over to the euro;    industry associations and institutions linked to the financial markets have been preparing for the complete integration of financial markets.     In summary, Member States have been given considerable leeway in the area of changeover preparations to implement different strategies for the introduction of the single currency. However, a competition-led process of mutual emulation has brought most public and private entities to similar conclusions. The developments I have just described highlight the intention of the great majority of public authorities and market participants throughout the EU to accelerate the pace of the changeover to the euro. The preparatory work for the euro is seen as a golden opportunity to upgrade the services provided by the public sector and to increase the efficiency of the financial system.       Developments after 1 January 2002    As from 1 January 2002, euro banknotes and coins will be introduced in all the Member States participating in Economic and Monetary Union at the same time. However, each Member State has the right to determine the pace of the cash changeover in its economy, provided it is completed by the middle of that year, i.e. end-June 2002. From that point onwards, only the euro will be in use as the national unit of account and means of payment in the participating countries of the Economic and Monetary Union and national currencies will no longer have legal tender status.        The single currency of Europe as a symbol of unity    I should now like to turn to the management and conduct of monetary policy once Economic and Monetary Union has been launched in January 1999.      Decision-making bodies and the decision-making process in the euro area    The monetary policy decisions will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB by simple majority. The Governing Council will be composed of the President and Vice-President, the other members of the Executive Board and the governors of the national central banks of the participating countries. Each member of the Governing Council will have a single vote. A key feature of the ECB is its independence in monetary policy decision-making, which is enshrined in the Treaty. The Bank of Japan\\'s independence - a process undertaken last year - confirms the importance of this feature. The execution of policy decisions will to a large extent be decentralised and rely on the infrastructure of the national central banks.       The ECB as guarantor of a stable euro    From the first day of Economic and Monetary Union, national central banks will transfer their monetary policy competencies to the ESCB, which will have the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and thus be the guarantor of a stable euro.       Strategy and instruments for the conduct of the single monetary policy    The EMI has published material in which it recommends two possible monetary policy strategies for the ECB to consider: monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. The final decision on which one - or on which combination - of the two strategies to adopt will need to be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB in 1998.  In its theoretical description, monetary targeting involves the central bank choosing a monetary aggregate as its intermediate target and deciding its monetary policy actions solely on the basis of comparisons between the target and actual monetary developments. By contrast, an inflation targeting strategy aims at directly steering the final target variable, the inflation rate, without the use of a separate intermediate target variable. Monetary policy actions are based on a comparison between the target for inflation and the forecast inflation rate.  The practical differences between these two theoretically distinct strategies are not so great and their application in different countries has shown that several variants integrating elements of both strategies may exist. Both strategies are based on the same final objective, price stability; they are forward-looking, and they employ a wide range of indicators to assess the appropriateness of the stance of monetary policy.  To achieve price stability, the ESCB will use a number of monetary policy instruments within the context of the chosen monetary policy strategy.  The EMI has already published a blueprint for the monetary policy instruments of the ECB. These will mainly comprise open market operations, supplemented by two standing facilities which will provide a ceiling and a floor to the corridor of official interest rates. Whether or not, in addition, use will be made of minimum reserve requirements remains to be decided by the Governing Council of the ECB.  The EMI has not recommended an exchange rate objective as an appropriate monetary policy strategy for the ECB, given that for an area potentially as large as the euro area, such an approach might be inconsistent with the internal goal of price stability. The external value of the euro will thus mainly be an outcome of the ECB\\'s monetary policy.  This is not to say, however, that the euro area will totally disregard exchange rates. The Treaty on European Union provides for the possible conclusion of formal exchange rate arrangements with non-EU countries. Its is unlikely that such arrangements will be made in the foreseeable future. The Treaty also provides for the formulation of general exchange rate orientations vis-à-vis non-EU currencies. But it has already been agreed that these will be resorted to in exceptional circumstances only and in any event without prejudice to the ESCB\\'s primary objective of maintaining price stability. The ESCB will also have the technical capacity to conduct intervention operations in order to counteract excessive or erratic fluctuations of the euro against the major non-EU currencies. In addition, the ESCB will be a party to the so-called ERM II arrangement, the successor to the current EMS, under which EU Member States which have not yet adopted the euro will manage their exchange rate against the euro.       The international role of the euro    There is no doubt that the creation of a single currency area will transform the international monetary landscape. Academics seem to be divided between those who expect the birth of a European monetary pole to contribute to more stable international exchange rate relations and those who anticipate increased volatility in the medium term in the foreign exchange markets. As the European economy will be characterised by stable low inflation and sustainable fiscal policies in the Member States, there is no a priori reason to expect increased exchange rate volatility; indeed, one could even expect the contrary. By conducting similar policies in all major industrial countries, one of the pre-conditions for a stable international monetary system will be in place.  The euro can be expected to become a major international currency, not only because it will be the currency of a large area but also because it is based on monetary and fiscal policy driven by the objective of stability. However, the international role of the euro will probably develop gradually..        Economic policy in EMU and some challenges    I should now like to address the question of how economic policy will be conducted in the European Union as from the start of Economic and Monetary Union.      The other components of a stability-oriented economic framework    Since EMU is not only about monetary union but also about economic union, it is evident that national economic policies cannot be conducted with total disregard to their potential spillover effects on neighbouring countries. On the other hand, economic union does not require a supranational decision-making on economic policies, and the Treaty clearly reflects this distinction between the monetary and the economic arrangements in Stage Three. This being said, there must be common institutional procedures to enable crucial issues of economic policy, almost - by definition - of common concern in the EU, to be raised and resolved at the Community level. Such procedures were already provided for in the Treaty and put into practice, but with the advent of Monetary Union they will need to be strengthened. I should like to highlight three such procedures.  The first mechanism is the formulation of broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Community, as stipulated in Article 103 of the Treaty. Monetary Union will inevitably create greater interdependence between the participating countries as well as the other EU countries bordering on the euro area. It is thus reasonable to assume that governments will feel the need to hold joint discussions and formulate economic orientations. The recent conclusions drawn by the European Council in Luxembourg (on 12 and 13 December 1997) confirm that the ECOFIN Council, which is the Council of all fifteen EU Finance Ministers, will be the centre of co-ordination for Member States\\' economic policies.  A second instrument is the so-called \"Stability and Growth Pact\", the terms of which were agreed at the Amsterdam Council of 16 and 17 June 1997. The Pact, which builds on and refines rules already laid down in the Treaty on the joint surveillance of economic developments (Article 102, paragraph 3) and joint EU procedures in the event of an excessive deficit in one or more Member States (Article 103), contains a shared goal for Member States - namely that of bringing government budgets in the medium term close to balance or even into surplus and to take corrective action to avoid excessive budgetary deficits. In this way, it will be possible to let the automatic stabilisers work, without causing public deficits and debt levels to increase and reach unsustainable levels.  A third element is what has been coined the \"Euro-x\" Council, which will informally gather the Finance Ministers of the Member States of the euro area for discussions on issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency. The Commission, and the ECB when appropriate, will be invited to take part in these meetings. Whenever matters of common EU-wide interest emerge, they will normally be discussed within the ECOFIN Council.  Other policy rules firmly enshrined in the Treaty with a disciplining effect on the behaviour of groups and institutions in the governmental area should not be overlooked: the prohibition on extending central bank credit to governmental institutions; the ban on any form of preferential access to credit by the public sector; and the \"no bail-out clause\", which prevents the transfer of one government\\'s liabilities to the Community or to other Member States.       The most frequent objections from economists overseas: the lack of a federal budget of the EU and insufficient labour mobility across national borders    Insufficient mobility of the labour force across the euro area is seen by some academics as a serious cause for concern for the longer-term viability of Economic and Monetary Union. Other compensatory mechanisms - such as large-scale financial transfers to the affected country or countries - will also be ruled out in Europe given that the budget of the Community will be very small.  But the existence of the Stability and Growth Pact leads to the conclusion that EMU does not need a centralised budget. With national budget positions close to balance or in surplus, countries have ample room for manoeuvre to cope with adverse economic developments.  Certainly, Europe requires more market flexibility to better ensure adjustments in EMU. However, labour market flexibility is required independently of EMU. The current excessive level of unemployment cannot be solved unless major structural reforms, especially in the labour markets, are implemented. That which is needed to make EMU work is also required in order to reduce unemployment in Europe. It is important to underline that the introduction of the euro, although in itself an important step in the further economic integration of Europe, will not - and cannot - solve all the problems and needs to be accompanied by other policies.        Conclusion    European integration has always been an evolutionary process.  Economic and Monetary Union in Europe is a further step in this process.  The euro will be a stable currency and, as such, it may become a further symbol of unity and shared values among Europeans. As the destinies of the peoples of the world become increasingly interdependent, the experience gained from European integration may be useful to all.   ']\n",
      "['1997-11-27', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Monetary policy in Europe - Quo Vadis?', 'Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Monetary Institute London, 27 November 1997', '  Monetary policy in Europe - Quo Vadis?   Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Monetary Institute London, 27 November 1997 Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in a fortunate position in Europe. We have been able to prepare a new monetary regime for Europe at a time when a consensus about the role of monetary policy exists among central bankers and the large majority of politicians and academics. We are thus able to shape the new institutions accordingly.  Let me first explain what I mean by the current consensus about the role of monetary policy among macroeconomists. Second, having established the state of the art (and it is certainly still true that central banking is more of an art than a science), I shall briefly describe my vision of how monetary policy could ideally be run in Europe, while illustrating my view that the structure of the ESCB and its operating procedures are in line with these standards, and may thus be able to transform that vision into reality.   A consensus in monetary policy   The views expressed in the following statements would nowadays be shared by a large majority of economists:  1 Monetary policy cannot influence the growth rate of the economy by having an effect on aggregate demand in the long run. Economic growth depends on the productivity and the supply of factors of production such as labour and capital. No central bank in the world is able to increase its country\\'s growth rate permanently by printing money or even by reducing the nominal interest rate to zero. The reason being that any excess demand over the production of goods and services will sooner or later be reflected in inflation. Persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Although monetary policy action can exert a temporary influence on the level of real economic activity - due particularly to sluggish adjustment of wages and prices. An \"activist\" monetary policy though aimed at boosting growth without due regard for price stability will merely cause inflation.  2 Expectations of market participants such as trade unions and employers are of crucial importance for the effect of any policy measure, and the expected reaction pattern of the central bank affects current decisions by the private sector. Let me give you an example. If the central bank is known to react to excessive wage demands by raising interest rates, thereby stabilising prices and temporarily reducing output, instead of by lowering rates to dampen the burden on firms affected by the wage shock, excessive wage demands may not occur in the first place. Thus, if the goal of price stability is evident and credible, stable monetary policy will become much easier to implement.  3 High inflation hampers economic growth. High and volatile inflation imposes substantial economic costs, such as those arising from increased uncertainty about the outcome of investment decisions and profitability, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-term interest rates and the reduced allocative effectiveness of the price and market system. In addition, social costs arise because the weaker members of society have more difficulty in protecting themselves against the adverse effects of inflation. There is agreement that inflation should be low, but no full consensus on what that exactly means in quantitative terms. Many of my European colleagues and myself would put the level at between 0 and 2%. Some others would envisage a somewhat wider range.   Implications for European monetary policy  On the basis of these views, the implications for a price stability oriented monetary policy in Europe are clear, and can be articulated as follows:  (i) given the desirability of low inflation, and since persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, it follows that a central bank\\'s goal should be price stability;  (ii) in pursuing the goal of price stability monetary policy may contribute to smoothing the level of economic activity in the short run, if inflationary pressures tend to follow a cyclical pattern. It should be noted that the success of such action depends crucially on the credibility of monetary policy;  (iii) it goes without saying that monetary policy and fiscal policy should be well aligned as an adverse policy mix would imply placing an excessive burden on monetary policy;  (iv) the importance of conditioning expectations and thus establishing the credibility of the central bank\\'s anti-inflationary stance requires independent central banking. A monetary authority should be able to act free of political pressure, and according to transparent policy rules which should also be communicated to the public. A rule which aims at stabilising prices - either via a direct inflation target or a money supply target - will smoothen the business cycle and allow the economy to grow at its potential growth rate;  Some of the past mistakes and deficiencies of monetary policy which have contributed over time to the emergence of the consensus I have just described have stemmed from a lack of independence. This has included attempts to use monetary policy for fiscal purposes (such as trying to reduce the real debt burden by surprise inflation) and the many unsuccessful attempts to boost growth through inflation, ignoring the effects on market expectations. A central bank which abandons its price stability target for a transitory gain in economic activity only contributes to higher average inflation. A central bank which has been susceptible to public pressure usually hits the brakes too late, too hard and, I might add, with unnecessarily heavy wear and tear on the \"tyres\" - aggravating the volatility of the business cycle rather than smoothing it out. I say this despite some proposals (Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist of the World Bank) claiming that \"we should not follow a policy of pre-emptive strikes, but rather one of cautious expansionism\" with which I disagree. This kind of strategy would mean in case of doubt letting the central bank err on the side of being too expansionary. The argument is that the costs of a minor increase in average inflation will be more than compensated by gains in employment. In my opinion, this argument again neglects the effect of market expectations. When people realise the systematic bias in the central banks monetary policy rule, there will be no output gain attached to the undoubtedly higher inflation rate. Nevertheless, there are costs involved. Even starting from low levels, higher inflation means higher volatility, which will then be reflected in higher risk premia and thus higher real interest rates - and eventually lower growth rates.   The future ESCB  If we cast an eye over the structure of the future European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the impression we get is that lessons have been learned and economic theory applied in the best possible manner. Maintaining price stability will be the ESCB\\'s primary responsibility. Without prejudice to this primary objective of price stability, the ESCB will support the general economic policies in the European Union. The Maastricht Treaty assigns independence to the ESCB for the purpose of carrying out its mandate. With regard to monetary strategy, monetary and inflation targeting are seen as the two benchmarks on the basis of which the ESCB\\'s strategy in Stage Three will be selected. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty, which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact clearly defines the exceptional circumstances under which excessive deficits are allowed and provides for a procedure which will ensure that excessive deficits are swiftly corrected, should they nevertheless arise, thus protecting the euro area against an unfavourable policy mix. The ESCB is prohibited from financing government debt. Thus the ESCB is relieved of any possible pressure to accommodate public debt by means of an expansionary monetary policy, which could otherwise have been interpreted as a constraint on its independence.  I would like to conclude by stating that the essence of good monetary policy is good institutional design. Apparently, lessons have been learned and principles have been applied successfully. Europe has the opportunity to bring what has at times been a tumultuous chapter in its monetary history to a close. It should seize that opportunity and enjoy the benefits that sustained price stability will bring. The task ahead is to broaden and deepen the public\\'s understanding of and support for the strategy and tactics of monetary policy and to lock in credibility for achieving low inflation, stable growth and lasting employment creation.

      "['1997-11-20', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Monetary policy in EMU', 'Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Monetary Institute Third International Finance and Economic Forum Vienna, 20 November 1997', '  Monetary policy in EMU   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Monetary Institute Third International Finance and Economic Forum Vienna, 20 November 1997 It is a great pleasure to be here to speak to you about monetary policy in Stage Three. Although the Maastricht Treaty assigns the European System of Central Banks, which will be composed of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the EU, the unambiguous primary objective \"to maintain price stability\", the strategy for pursuing this objective is not laid down in the Treaty, and hence needs to be defined. In fact, the monetary policy strategy for the euro area will only be chosen after the establishment of the ESCB, shortly after the initial composition of Monetary Union is decided in May 1998. Nevertheless, the EMI has an important role to play in preparing the decision on an appropriate strategy for the ESCB. In my remarks, I shall first discuss the importance of price stability before going on to examine the two possible monetary policy strategies for Stage Three.   I Monetary policy and price stability  The importance of price stability for the successful long-term performance of the economy is now widely recognised. Indeed, there seems to be a world-wide convergence of thinking among central bankers and politicians alike on the importance of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. Moreover, empirical research has shown that both the average rate of inflation and its variability tend to decline in line with increased central bank independence. Accordingly, a growing number of central banks have been given a legal mandate in recent years to ensure price stability.  The aim of ensuring price stability must be viewed in a long-term context as a permanent goal and not as a short-term one-off objective. Enterprises and households are concerned about the long-term effects of inflation and price developments on decisions related to investment and saving. Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve, has said that price stability is achieved when the public no longer takes account of actual or prospective inflation in its decision-making. To achieve this goal, monetary policy must be oriented beyond the horizon of its short-term impact on inflation and the economy.  The purpose of monetary policy actions is to set the economy on a long-term, permanent path towards price stability and, in so doing, to create the conditions necessary for sound economic growth. Price stability is a means of promoting sustainable economic growth and job creation, and improving both productivity levels and living standards. Conversely, a rising price level - even at moderate rates of inflation - imposes substantial economic costs, such as those arising from increased uncertainty about the outcome of investment decisions and profitability, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-term interest rates and the reduced allocative effectiveness of the price and market systems. In addition, social costs arise because the weaker members of society have more difficulty in protecting themselves against the adverse effects of inflation.  The Maastricht Treaty guarantees the independence of the ESCB, which will be composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the EU. As I explained a moment ago, it assigns an unambiguous primary objective to the ESCB, namely \"to maintain price stability\". Some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that the ECB will no longer be concerned about output and employment growth. I do not agree with this view.  First, the most important contribution that monetary policy can make towards balanced growth and employment is to provide a stable price environment. However, it would be misleading to assume that the ESCB will bear sole responsibility for establishing and maintaining price stability for the euro. Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound budgetary policies and wage developments in line with productivity growth. In other words, the overall policy mix must be appropriate. Without adequate support from other policy areas, the ESCB may be forced to take measures in the fight against inflation which will entail a short-term loss in output and employment. This explains the importance attached to the fact that the Maastricht Treaty assigns a high degree of independence to the ESCB in carrying out its mandate. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact clearly defines the exceptional circumstances under which excessive deficits are permitted and, should any arise, provides for a procedure which will ensure their swift correction.  Second, it should be clear that the single monetary policy in EMU will apply to the euro area as a whole. As a consequence, it cannot be used for solving regional problems or responding to country-specific economic shocks. These require, above all, smoothly functioning labour and product markets which allow wages and prices to be adjusted, should local economic conditions change. In addition, national budgets must allow sufficient room for manoeuvre to enable automatic stabilisers to work. As a key element of the Stability and Growth Pact, all Member States have committed themselves to achieving a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus in the medium term.  Third, sustainable growth and job creation require more than just an appropriate monetary policy. This can be illustrated by the current unemployment problem in Europe. As its underlying causes are structural, its solution will require structural remedies and not an expansionary monetary policy. As the experience of recent years has shown, those Member States that have undertaken fundamental labour market reforms have achieved both a strong recovery of employment and stable prices. At the same time, they have often successfully managed to reduce their budget deficits. The general lesson to be learnt is that if all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, price stability will go hand in hand with a well balanced economic development in the longer term.  To summarise, it will be essential to ensure that an appropriate overall policy mix is achieved in Stage Three of EMU. A stable price and financial environment enhances the capacity of monetary policy to react appropriately to cyclical weakness in the economy. Some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that the ESCB will act contrary to output and employment growth. I believe this view to be wrong. Rather, stable prices are a condition for sound long-term growth and the sustainable creation of employment. Moreover, if price pressures are lowest at the trough of the business cycle, monetary policy can, in pursuing its objective of price stability, as a by-product also contribute to smoothing the business cycle. Such a result requires, however, that price stability be established and the credibility of the central bank in respect of its efforts to safeguard that goal be not in doubt.   II Monetary policy strategy in EMU  Given the lead times involved, both the framework for monetary policy implementation and the instruments and procedures required for this needed to be prepared well in advance of EMU. The EMI also has an important role to play in selecting a strategy for the ESCB. On the basis of current practice at the central banks and taking theoretical considerations into account, two potential candidate strategies have been considered by the EMI for Stage Three: monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.  The application of these two strategies in different countries has shown that several variants combining elements of both strategies exist, with the borderlines between them being sometimes blurred. In its extreme theoretical variant, monetary targeting would involve the central bank choosing a monetary aggregate as its intermediate target and deciding on its monetary policy actions on the sole basis of comparisons between the target and actual monetary developments. In practice, a central bank following monetary targeting adopts a more flexible approach which involves, in addition to the pursuit of the target, the monitoring of supplementary variables, including indicators of future inflation. It should be noted that several central banks pursuing monetary targets also set quantitative medium-term norms for the final objective, price stability, in order to increase the transparency of their policy.  Inflation targeting strategies, in contrast, aim to steer the final target variable, the inflation rate, directly without having recourse to the use of a separate intermediate target variable. Since monetary policy affects the final objective with a lag, monetary policy actions under direct inflation targeting strategies are based on a comparison between the target for inflation and the forecast inflation rate. In several countries which practise inflation targeting, monetary aggregates play a prominent role among the various inflation indicators that are employed, including the setting of quantitative \"monitoring ranges\" as reference values for these variables.  This brief description helps to indicate that, in practice, the differences between monetary and inflation targeting strategies are not overwhelming, since both strategies typically have the following key features in common: they are based on the same final objective, price stability; they are forward-looking (i.e. they are not based on current inflation developments); and they employ a wide range of indicators to assess the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.  The main distinguishing factor between the two strategies is the role played by monetary aggregates. While monetary aggregates are taken into account as part of inflation targeting strategies, a strategy which publicly sets targets for monetary growth clearly places more emphasis on monetary developments. This central role of monetary aggregates in the monetary targeting strategy is based on the assumption that excessive money growth will generate inflation and that the chosen monetary aggregate has certain properties which make it a suitable intermediate target variable for monetary policy.  The assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies for the ESCB should be guided by a certain number of principles, including effectiveness, accountability, medium-term orientation and continuity. Allow me to say a few words about these guiding principles.  The effectiveness of monetary targeting depends very much on whether a stable (or at least predictable) relationship exists between the chosen monetary aggregate and the final price objective. It also depends on whether monetary aggregates possess desirable leading indicator properties for future inflation. Recent empirical studies carried out for different groups of EU countries show that EU-wide money demand functions appear to be relatively stable and some monetary aggregates have leading indicator properties for inflationary developments. On the other hand, these studies may not be representative of the situation in Stage Three. The possibility of damage to the credibility of the ESCB under a monetary targeting strategy could not be excluded if monetary aggregates were highly volatile at the start of Stage Three. Direct inflation targeting provides a quantitative reference for future inflation which is aimed specifically at anchoring inflation expectations. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the ability of the central bank to forecast accurately and to control future inflation.  With regard to accountability, any strategy will need to involve the formulation and announcement of targets so that the ESCB can be held accountable to the public for its actions. An inflation targeting procedure would directly stress the responsibility of the ESCB for maintaining price stability, although it should be noted that inflation is affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the central bank. On the other hand, a monetary targeting strategy would make the central bank responsible for developments which are directly observable by the public and which are more directly under control.  Both strategies can be seen as being oriented towards the medium term, thereby providing an anchor for inflation expectations. In this respect, both strategies provide some scope for allowing short-term deviations from the target, if these can be explained to the public. Finally, the adoption of monetary targeting would offer the advantage of ensuring continuity with the strategy of the EU central bank whose currency has hitherto performed the anchor function in the ERM. On the other hand, it could be argued that the experience so far of those EU central banks which use direct inflation targets has also been relatively successful.  Under any monetary strategy, the ESCB will also have to define \"price stability\". While it is difficult to provide a precise theoretical definition of price stability, it would be fair to say that a rate of consumer price inflation not exceeding 2% is probably close to a level with which central banks would normally be quite satisfied. In this context, issues of price measurement will be especially important. Progress towards a consistent measure of inflation across the EU countries has been made with the publication of harmonised consumer price indices by EUROSTAT. It is particularly important to cater for the effects of rapid technological progress, innovation and the role of consumer services. As noted by my colleague, Alan Greenspan, in a recent speech, inflation may be overestimated if such elements are not dealt with carefully and accurate measurement of inflation is especially crucial when the overall rate of inflation is low. In the same speech, Mr. Greenspan pointed out that further progress may be necessary to ensure the broadest possible coverage of consumer goods and services. The EMI also advocates as broad a coverage as possible; to meet this aim, EUROSTAT has already proposed a timetable for an expansion of the coverage of the harmonised index of consumer prices, part of which will take place in January 1999 at the outset of Monetary Union.  Before moving on from the issue of monetary policy, I should like to add that preparation of the infrastructure needed for either monetary policy strategy is proceeding satisfactorily. Statistical preparation is well under way, notably for the case of monetary data. The EMI has also started to prepare tools for forecasting, such as a \"multi-country econometric model\", that will be made available to the ESCB. Furthermore, the preparation of a number of tools for analysing and monitoring the economic situation in Stage Three is ongoing.  Work on the instruments and procedures to be used in EMU is also progressing well. In September, the EMI published a further report on monetary policy instruments and procedures, the so-called \"General documentation\". The report updates the \"Framework Report\" and takes into account the progress made in the specification of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy instruments and procedures in the meantime. The main aim of the report is to provide financial institutions with the information they need in order to prepare for participation in monetary policy operations with the ESCB.   Conclusion  The continuing challenge for central banks is to ensure long-term credibility for monetary policy by sustaining an environment of low inflation. Maintaining price stability will be the ESCB\\'s primary responsibility. With regard to monetary strategy, monetary and inflation targeting are seen as the two main benchmarks in the light of which the choice of the ESCB\\'s strategy in Stage Three will be made. Both strategies have a number of key elements in common, such as the objective of price stability, a forward-looking nature and the use of a wide range of indicators in determining the monetary policy stance. In selecting its strategy, the ESCB will be confronted with a situation in which there will still be some structural differences between participating countries, as well as cross-country differences in economic policies. Furthermore, the transition to Stage Three will increase uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission process. In this respect, a thorough analysis of all the relevant factors will be essential, whatever the circumstances, as will a careful explanation of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy actions in the context of its monetary strategy. This will also make it easier to cope with a new and changing environment at the start of Stage Three./.   ']\n",
      "['1997-11-15', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Monetary policy in EMU', 'Speech by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute Universidade Nova De Lisboa Lisbon, 15 November 1997', '  Monetary policy in EMU   Speech by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute Universidade Nova De Lisboa Lisbon, 15 November 1997 It is a great pleasure to be here to speak to you about monetary policy in Stage Three. Whereas the Maastricht Treaty assigns an unambiguous primary objective to the ESCB, which is \"to maintain price stability\", the strategy to pursue this objective was not laid down, and hence a choice needs to be made. In fact, the monetary policy strategy for the euro area will only be chosen after the establishment of the ESCB, shortly after the initial composition of the Monetary Union is decided in May 1998. Nevertheless, the EMI has an important role to play in preparing the decision on a appropriate strategy for the ESCB. In my remarks, I shall first discuss the importance of price stability before going on to examine the two possible monetary policy strategies in Stage Three.   I Monetary policy and price stability  The importance of price stability to the successful long-term performance of the economy is now widely recognised. Indeed, there seems to be a world-wide convergence of thinking among central bankers and politicians alike on the importance of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. Empirical research has shown that both the average rate of inflation and its variability tend to decline in line with increased central bank independence. Accordingly, a growing number of central banks have been given a legal mandate to ensure price stability in recent years.  Ensuring price stability must be viewed in a long-term context as a permanent goal and not as a short-term one-off objective. Companies and households are concerned about the long-term effects of inflation and price developments on decisions related to investment and saving. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has said that price stability is achieved when the public no longer takes account of actual or prospective inflation in its decision-making. To achieve that goal means that monetary policy must be oriented beyond the horizon of its short-term impact on inflation and the economy.  The purpose of monetary policy actions is to set the economy on a long-term, permanent path to price stability and thereby to create the conditions for sound economic growth. Price stability is a means of promoting sustainable economic growth, employment creation and of improving productivity levels and living standards. Conversely, a rising price level - even at moderate rates - imposes substantial economic costs, such as those arising from increased uncertainty about the outcome of investment decisions and profitability, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-term interest rates and the reduced allocative effectiveness of the price and market systems. In addition, social costs arise because the weaker members of society have more difficulty in protecting themselves against the adverse effects of inflation.  The Maastricht Treaty guarantees the independence of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which is made up of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the EU. It assigns an unambiguous primary objective to the ESCB, namely \"to maintain price stability\". Some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that the ECB will be no longer concerned about output and employment growth. I believe this view to be wrong.  First, the most important contribution that monetary policy can make towards balanced growth and employment is to provide for a stable price environment. It would be misleading to assume that the ESCB bears sole responsibility for establishing and maintaining price stability for the euro. Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound budgetary policies and wage developments in line with productivity growth. In other words, the overall policy mix must be appropriate. Without adequate support from other policy areas, the ESCB may be forced to take measures in the fight against inflation which entail a short-term loss in output and employment. This explains why it is so important that the Maastricht Treaty assigns a high degree of independence to the ESCB in carrying out its mandate. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact clearly defines the exceptional circumstances under which excessive deficits are allowed and provides for a procedure which will ensure that excessive deficits are swiftly corrected should they nevertheless arise.  Second, one should realise that monetary policy in EMU applies to the euro area as a whole. As a consequence, it cannot be used for solving regional problems or country-specific economic shocks. These require above all well-functioning labour and product markets which allow wages and prices to adjust if local economic conditions have changed. In addition, national budgets must have sufficient room for manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers work. As a key element of the Stability and Growth Pact, all Member States have therefore committed themselves to the achievement of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term  Third, sustainable growth and creation of employment require more than just an appropriate monetary policy. This can be illustrated by the current unemployment problem in Europe. As its underlying causes are structural, its solution requires structural remedies and not an expansionary monetary policy. As the experience of recent years shows, those Member States that have undertaken fundamental labour market reforms have achieved both a strong recovery of employment and stable prices. At the same time, they often successfully managed to reduce their budget deficits. The general lesson to be learnt is that if all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, price stability will over the longer term go hand in hand with a balanced economic development.  To summarise, it is essential to ensure that in Stage Three of EMU an appropriate overall policy mix is achieved. A stable price and financial environment enhances the capacity of monetary policy to react appropriately to cyclical weakness in the economy. A central bank\\'s long-term commitment to price stability does not mean that monetary policy will ignore the short-term impact of economic events and developments in the business cycle. When price stability is established and the credibility of the central bank in respect of its efforts to safeguard that goal is not in doubt, monetary policy can play a role in stabilising the business cycle, provided this is not at the cost of price stability and provided so-called fine-tuning is avoided.   II Monetary policy strategy in EMU  Given lead times, the framework for monetary policy implementation, the instruments and procedures needed to be prepared well in advance of EMU. The EMI has also an important role to play in preparing for the decision on a strategy for the ESCB. On the basis of current central bank practices and taking into account theoretical considerations, two possible strategies have been considered by the EMI for Stage Three: monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.  The application of these two strategies in different countries has shown that several variants combining elements of both strategies exist, with the borderlines between them being sometimes blurred. In its extreme theoretical variant, monetary targeting would involve the central bank choosing a monetary aggregate as its intermediate target and deciding on its monetary policy actions on the sole basis of comparisons between the target and actual monetary developments. In practice, a central bank following monetary targeting adopts a more flexible approach which involves, in addition to the pursuit of the target, the monitoring of supplementary variables, including indicators of future inflation. It is notable that several central banks pursuing monetary targets also set quantitative medium-term norms for the final objective, price stability, in order to increase the transparency of their policy.  Inflation targeting strategies, in contrast, aim to steer the final target variable, the inflation rate, directly without having recourse to the use of a separate intermediate target variable. Since monetary policy affects the final objective only with a lag, monetary policy actions under direct inflation targeting strategies are based on a comparison between the target for inflation and the forecast inflation rate. In several countries pursuing inflation targeting, monetary aggregates play a prominent role among the various inflation indicators that are employed, including the setting of quantitative \"monitoring ranges\" as reference values for these variables.  This brief description already indicates that, in practice, differences between monetary and inflation targeting strategies are not overwhelming. In fact, both strategies typically have the following key features in common: they are based on the same final objective, price stability, they are forward-looking (i.e. they are not based on current inflation developments) and they employ a wide range of indicators to assess the appropriateness of the stance of monetary policy.  The main factor distinguishing the two strategies is the role played by monetary aggregates. While monetary aggregates are taken into account under inflation targeting strategies, more emphasis is clearly placed on monetary developments in a strategy which publicly sets targets for monetary growth. This central role of monetary aggregates is based on the assumption that excessive money growth will generate inflation and that the chosen monetary aggregate satisfies properties which makes it a suitable intermediate target variable for monetary policy.  The assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies for the ESCB should be guided by a certain number of principles, including effectiveness, accountability, medium-term orientation and continuity. Let me say a few words on these guiding principles.  The effectiveness of monetary targeting depends very much on whether a stable (or at least predictable) relationship exists between the chosen monetary aggregate and the final price objective. It also depends on whether monetary aggregates possess desirable leading indicator properties for future inflation. Recent empirical studies carried out for different groups of EU countries show that area-wide money demand functions appear relatively stable and some monetary aggregates have leading indicator properties for inflationary developments. On the other hand, these studies may not be representative of the situation in Stage Three. The possibility of damage to the credibility of the ESCB under a monetary targeting strategy could not be excluded if monetary aggregates were highly volatile at the start of Stage Three. Direct inflation targeting provides a quantitative reference for future inflation which is aimed specifically at anchoring inflation expectations. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the ability of the central bank to forecast accurately and to control future inflation.  With regard to accountability, any strategy will need to involve the formulation and announcement of targets so that the ESCB can be held accountable to the public for its actions. Targeting inflation directly would stress the ESCB\\'s responsibility of maintaining price stability, although it should be noted that inflation is affected by numerous factors outside the control of the central bank. On the other hand, a monetary targeting strategy makes the central bank responsible for developments which are directly observable by the public and which are more directly under the control of the central bank.  Both strategies can be seen as oriented towards the medium-term, thereby providing an anchor for inflation expectations. In this respect, both strategies provide some scope for allowing short-term deviations from the target, if these can be explained to the public. Finally, the adoption of monetary targeting would offer the advantage of ensuring continuity with the strategy of the EU central bank whose currency has performed the anchor function in the ERM. On the other hand, it might be argued that the experience of EU central banks with direct inflation targets so far has also been relatively successful.  Under any monetary strategy, the ESCB will also have to define what \"price stability\" means. While theory does not provide a precise definition of price stability and while there are various statistical measures of inflation, one could say that a rate of consumer price inflation not exceeding 2% is probably not far off what central banks would normally be quite satisfied with.  At this point, let me briefly mention the issue of the external value of the euro. The average degree of openness of the Member States of the EU (as measured by the share of exports in GDP) is currently 30%, compared with 8% for the United States and 9% for Japan. If intra-EU trade is excluded, the degree of openness of the European Community is 10%, similar to that of the United States and Japan. Its economic and commercial weight is comparable to that of the United States and larger than that of Japan. In other words, we are dealing with a large but relatively closed economy. With a low import and export ratio, the effect of exchange rate movements on internal price developments and competitiveness will be limited. This will allow the ESCB to focus primarily on \"domestic\" inflationary risks and to consider fluctuations in the euro exchange rate only to the extent that these significantly affect \"domestic\" prices. This also explains why any so-called orientations that might be formulated by the ECOFIN Council in the field of exchange rate policy for the euro area will have to be limited to exceptional circumstances. As stated in the Treaty, such general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability.  This does not mean that the euro area should adopt an attitude of \"benign neglect\" with regard to the external value of the euro. First, exchange rate developments will continue to be monitored informally by the major global players, as is currently the case although in the context of new institutional arrangements to be devised. The introduction of the euro may indeed strengthen policy co-ordination between the US, Japan and Europe and contribute to the promotion of exchange rate stability since these three blocs are each pursuing policies aimed at internal stability. Of course, there may still be residual fluctuations in exchange rates owing to differences in cyclical positions and associated policy responses.  Second, in terms of the exchange rate, the relationship between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries will be of considerable significance. Following preparatory work by the EMI, the European Council adopted a resolution on the new mechanism (ERM II) this year. ERM II will ensure that trade and financial flows between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries will not be distorted by large swings in exchange rates. It will also help those countries not joining EMU at the beginning of Stage Three to orient their policies towards convergence, so that they may qualify for participation as soon as possible after the start of Stage Three. To summarise, the internal value of the euro - price stability - will be the objective of the ESCB and when other countries also adhere to this objective, this will create favourable conditions for a stable external value of the euro.  Before leaving the issue of monetary policy, I may add that preparation of the framework for monetary policy implementation, the instruments and procedures in EMU has advanced. The EMI has published in September a further report on monetary policy instruments and procedures, the so-called \"General Documentation\". That report updates the \"Framework Report\" and takes into account the progress made in the specification of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy instruments and procedures in the meantime. The main aim of this report is to provide financial institutions with the information they will need in order to prepare for participation in monetary policy operations with the ESCB. Moreover, the EMI has started preparing tools for forecasting, such as a \"Multi-country econometric model\", that will be made available to the ESCB. Furthermore, preparation of a number of tools for the analysis and monitoring of the conjunctural situation in Stage Three is ongoing.   Conclusion  The continuing challenge for central banks is to ensure long-term credibility for monetary policy by sustaining an environment of low inflation. Maintaining price stability will be the ESCB\\'s primary responsibility. With regard to monetary strategy, monetary and inflation targeting are seen as the two main benchmarks on the basis of which the choice of the ESCB\\'s strategy in Stage Three will be made. Both strategies have a number of key elements in common, such as the objective of price stability, a forward-looking nature and the employment of a wide range of indicators in the determination of the monetary policy stance. In the selection of its strategy, the ESCB will be confronted with a situation in which there will be remaining structural differences across participating countries as well as cross-country differences in economic policies. Furthermore, the transition to Stage Three will increase uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission process. In that respect, a thorough analysis of all relevant factors will be requested under all circumstances as well as a careful explanation of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy action in the context of its monetary strategy. That will also help to cope with a new and changing environment at the start of Stage Three./.   ']\n",
      "['1997-11-14', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Conditions for the success of EMU', 'Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, Pamplona, 14 November 1997', '  Conditions for the success of EMU   Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, Pamplona, 14 November 1997  1 Introduction  I would like to address the issue of the conditions necessary for EMU to be a success. I should like to focus on three topics: first, the technical and institutional requirements related to the establishment of the ESCB and the single monetary policy; second, the need for sustainable convergence among the countries which will form the euro area and, finally, the need for a balanced policy mix between monetary and other economic policies in Stage Three of Monetary Union.   2 Technical requirements  The first topic - the technical and institutional requirements - will also enable me to give you a brief outline of what we are doing at the EMI. The EMI is responsible for preparing the operational framework that will enable the ESCB to conduct the single monetary policy in Stage Three of EMU. In this context, we are nearing the conclusion of several years of tough but ultimately successful preparatory work. I should like to summarise very briefly the achievements in some of the most important fields of this work.  With regard to the monetary strategy to be adopted by the ESCB, the EMI has retained two potential strategies as candidates for approval, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting, both of which are used by the national central banks. At this stage, it appears neither desirable nor necessary to choose between them. The final decision on which strategy to adopt will be the responsibility of the ECB.  By contrast, the framework for the instruments and procedures of monetary policy - which will be used to guide short-term interest rates - has already been broadly defined. The ESCB will mainly use open market operations, in most cases employing reverse transactions, but it will also offer two standing facilities: a marginal lending facility and a deposit facility. The interest rates on these facilities will set the upper and lower limits for short-term money market interest rates. A broad range of counterparties will have access to the ESCB operations, and it has been agreed that the bulk of monetary policy operations will be carried out, in a decentralised manner, by the national central banks. Preparations have also been made for an infrastructure that will allow the ECB to impose minimum reserve requirements, if it so chooses. Our recent report entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three, General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\", which was released in September of this year, updates the operational framework, taking account of the most recent progress made in its specification. The main aim of this report is to provide financial institutions with the information they will need to prepare for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations in Stage Three.  To ensure that a single money market interest rate holds across the euro area, the integration of payment systems is an essential element of the technical preparations for Stage Three. The EMI and the NCBs are developing an interbank funds transfer system, called TARGET, which will be able to process cross-border payments denominated in euro as smoothly as if they were domestic payments. It will interlink the domestic real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems which the NCBs have agreed to implement in their respective countries. Furthermore, this year the EMI Council endorsed the decision to choose S.W.I.F.T. as the Interlinking network provider and a contract was finalised. The testing of NCBs\\' links with the EMI\\'s test centre has begun. The EMI has just published a further progress report, covering detailed issues such as the harmonisation of the operating time of domestic RTGS systems linked to TARGET and pricing policy.  In the field of foreign exchange policy, the ESCB will have the capacity to conduct foreign exchange intervention by means of transactions in foreign reserves valued at up to EUR 50 billion, which will be transferred from the NCBs to the ECB. All decisions related to intervention will be taken by the ECB, while the implementation of such decisions will be either centralised or decentralised within the ESCB. Furthermore, following preparatory work by the EMI, the European Council adopted a resolution on the new exchange rate relationship between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries - the so-called ERM II - in Amsterdam in June of this year.  The recent political decision by the ECOFIN Council, to pre-announce the bilateral exchange rates which will be used for determining the euro conversion rates of the currencies of the participants in Monetary Union at the time of their selection, was well received by market participants, as it was seen as a strong sign of commitment to the EMU process. The pre-announcement is expected to reduce the risk of exchange rate instability in the so-called interim period prior to the irrevocable fixing of the euro exchange rates against the euro area currencies on 1 January 1999. In the interim period the co-operation in the conduct of monetary policies has to be intensified further. It is too early to tell what the common short term interest rate of the euro-area members at the end of 1998 will be. What is clear, however, is that there is a widespread misconception that this rate has to be an average of the actual short term rates in some group of EU-countries. The only thing that can be said now is that the rate should be at the level required for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.  Following the agreement at the December 1995 Madrid summit on the EMI\\'s plan for the changeover to the euro, the authorities pre-announced a chronological sequence of events, which was formulated on the basis of a small number of critical benchmark dates. The preparations for the changeover to the euro have gained momentum over the past twelve months. National changeover scenarios have been defined in most EU countries. Meanwhile the legal framework for the changeover process has been substantiated in two Council Regulations which will form the lex monetae of the Community. One element still to be agreed is the common date for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. In line with subsidiarity, the practical arrangements for the changeover will have to be made by the EU Member States. In parallel, there has been an increasing amount of investment by the private sector in the adaption of systems and procedures across the entire European Union.  Finally, I would just like to mention that the EMI and the NCBs have started to reflect on the functions of the ECB, as well as the nature of relationships between the ECB and the national central banks within the ESCB. A great deal of thought has been given to these issues within the EMI, and the EMI Council has given serious consideration to staffing requirements. I consider it likely that around 500 staff members will be required; the EMI currently employs around 350 members of staff.   3 Sustainable convergence  Besides bringing the preparatory work to a successful conclusion, it is of utmost importance for the success of Monetary Union that a high degree of sustainable convergence be obtained with regard to price stability, sound fiscal positions, exchange rate stability and the convergence of long-term interest rates for those countries which participate in Monetary Union. These criteria are intended to \"level the playing-field\" in order to ensure a smooth start for the single monetary policy. Moreover, the fiscal criteria will continue to apply in the monetary union. The provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact will contribute towards making Monetary Union sustainable in the longer term.  The dangers of there being a lack of convergence at the start of EMU are obvious. In particular, if national fiscal positions are not under control from the outset, there may be repercussions on the single monetary policy and adverse spillover effects across borders affecting Monetary Union as a whole. Similarly, significant inflation differences across countries might lead to unsustainable divergences in prices and costs within the euro area or to an unnecessarily tight monetary policy for countries that have achieved price stability.  Under the Maastricht Treaty, the EMI and the Commission have been given the task of examining the progress towards convergence and of assisting the European Council in establishing which EU countries fulfil their obligations in respect of the achievement of the convergence criteria. The results of these examinations will be presented in the spring of 1998.  Current performances indicate that a significant downward convergence towards price stability has taken place in recent years. This reflects the determination of the national central banks across the entire European Union to pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy. In no less than fourteen countries, inflation observed over the past twelve months was below the reference value calculated according to the Treaty. The inflation rate for the EU as a whole is currently below 2%. There has also been considerable progress in bond yield convergence, and - with some exceptions - exchange rate stability has been broadly maintained throughout the EU over the past couple of years.  On the fiscal side, despite significant progress over the past few years, the sustainability of public finances in EU countries remains an issue. The latest official data show that in 1996 many EU countries had exceeded the reference values for public deficits and debt ratios laid down in theTreaty. For 1997, forecasts from the European Commission and the IMF suggest that most countries are expected to meet the reference values for public deficits, although the projections have yet to be confirmed by outcomes. When assessing the soundness and durability of the correction of public finances in early 1998 on the basis of the 1997 figures, the EMI will, inter alia, take careful note of the potential impact of temporary or \"one-off\" measures. If the impact of temporary effects on the budget deficit figures proves to be significant, this will signal the necessity to implement in 1998 additional measures with permanent effects in order to guarantee the sustainability of public finances. It is, however, rather difficult to distinguish permanent influences on the budgetary position, even when one-off or temporary measures are excluded, which renders the assessment of sustainability more difficult. In analysing the issue of sustainability the EMI will follow both a backward and forward looking approach. Our final view will be expressed in the Convergence Report which will be published in the spring of 1998.  Convergence is required not only in macroeconomic terms, but also in legal terms. The achievement of central bank independence is an important precondition in order to qualify for participation in EMU. Considerable progress has been made by Member States in adapting the statutes of their respective central banks in order to comply with the requirements arising from the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB/ECB. The statutes of some central banks require further adaptation, in particular with a view to their integration into the ESCB. Where this is the case, legislative action is under way.   4 A balanced policy-mix  The ECB will be established shortly after the decision is made on the list of countries that will participate in EMU. On 1 January 1999 the ESCB will start conducting the single monetary policy with a view to maintaining price stability in the euro area. The pursuit of this objective, in full independence, will serve to safeguard the foundations for balanced growth and employment in the longer run. It would, however, be incorrect to say that the ESCB will have the sole responsibility for maintaining price stability in the euro area. Monetary policy needs to be supported by other economic policies; in particular, fiscal policies need to be sound and wage developments need to be in line with productivity growth. Without adequate support from other policy areas, the ESCB may be forced to take measures to dampen inflationary pressures, which may entail a short-term loss in output and employment. This might have negative consequences for public acceptance of the single monetary policy.  It has been argued that it will be more difficult in Monetary Union to cope with real asymmetric shocks, such as German unification. I do not, however, believe that shocks of the nature and magnitude of German unification are likely to be repeated in the future. Moreover, the past ten to fifteen years have witnessed a considerable convergence of the economic and social structures of the EU countries. Accordingly, our national problems - those relating to unemployment, social security and pension systems - have also become quite similar, and their solution will therefore require a similar approach. Furthermore, most of the real shocks in the past created problems not so much because they were asymmetric, but because the policy responses were different. The oil shocks in the 1970s serve as good examples. Our policy philosophies - both in monetary and fiscal terms - have undergone a thorough and welcome convergence process since then. However, one cannot exclude entirely the possibility that it will be necessary to accommodate asymmetric shocks hitting individual countries participating in Monetary Union. Sustainability in fiscal positions would give enough room to cope with asymmetric shocks and adverse cyclical developments by letting the automatic stabilizers work. This provides a supplementary incentive for sound fiscal positions and is an element of the Stability and Growth pact. Europe does not need a centralised budget to cope with asymmetric shocks. This is taken care of at the national level.  Turning to structural issues affecting fiscal sustainability, it is also important that governments should implement measures for coping with new budgetary challenges, such as ageing populations, where governments face massive future liabilities of social security systems. In the absence of appropriate reforms, sizable increases in contributions or even substantial increases in government indebtedness would appear to be forthcoming which may also be a threat to maintaining price stability.  There are also a number of other significant challenges in the economic environment; notably, there is a clear and insistent need for structural adjustment, in particular in labour and product markets. Unemployment in most EU countries, though showing signs of stabilising, remains unacceptably high, and the forecast for the situation in labour markets is not one of significant improvement in the absence of structural reforms. The weak employment performance in Europe seems to a large extent to be due to a wide range of institutional rigidities, and how to tackle them decisively enough to reduce unemployment will be a major challenge. Removing these rigidities is also important to make EMU a success, since flexible wages and prices are necessary adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union. Therefore, in this area what is required for solving the unemployment problem is also necessary for making monetary union work.  The task is thus to ensure that in Stage Three of EMU an appropriate overall policy mix is achieved. For the monetary policy decisions of the ESCB to be well-informed and optimal with respect to its objectives, there is evidently a need for regular dialogue and an exchange of information with third parties on issues of common interest. This will apply in particular to national economic policies, wage developments and the overall fiscal policy stance in the Monetary Union. If all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, price stability will, over the longer term, be consistent with balanced economic development.   5 Conclusion  To conclude, a high degree of sustainable convergence and a balanced policy mix are necessary conditions for EMU to be a success. EU Member States have made considerable progress in terms of economic convergence, although challenges remain in terms of structural reforms, notably in the area of fiscal policy and labour markets. Considerable progress has also been made by the EMI in terms of the necessary technical preparations for the single currency to be introduced, on schedule on 1 January 1999. The greatest challenge that lies ahead is to maintain price stability within the euro area after the start of Stage Three, in fulfilment of the mandate given to the ESCB under the Maastricht Treaty. Personally, I am convinced that the application of the convergence criteria, the institutional arrangements for the ESCB and the preparations made to date will ensure that the euro will be a stable currency and that the ESCB will be a powerful institution which will safeguard the value of the new currency./.

Duisenberg, President of the EMI, at the National Conference of the Confederation of British Industry, Birmingham, 10 November 1997', '  Where do we stand in the EMU process?   Keynote address by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the EMI, at the National Conference of the Confederation of British Industry, Birmingham, 10 November 1997 In addressing you on the issue of where we are in the EMU process, I shall consider progress in respect of economic convergence, foreign exchange policy, the changeover to the euro and preparatory work for the single monetary policy in Stage Three. I shall conclude with observations on the conduct of monetary policy by the ESCB in Stage Three.   1 Ensuring sustainable convergence  The key outstanding economic challenge in the EMU process is undoubtedly the selection, in the Spring of next year, of countries deemed eligible to take part in EMU as of 1 January 1999. The EMI stresses the importance of countries achieving a high degree of sustainable convergence.  One of the untercertainties in the selection of the Euro-area countries has recently been removed. The UK will not participate in EMU from the outset. On the one hand, I think it is unfortunate that such an important country as the United Kingdom will not be among the founding fathers of the euro. On the other hand, it is welcome that one of the main uncertainties surrounding the EMU-process no longer exists. It is also welcome that the UK-Government is in favour of EMU in principle.  The UK debate on EMU very often focuses on psychological and political aspects such as the so-called transfer of sovereignty to the ESCB. Important as these issues may be, the statement of the Chancellor rightly makes clear that EMU needs also to be assessed on economic grounds.  In this respect, it is essential that UK economic policies remain aimed at further convergence. I note with satisfaction that the Chancellor has stated that he will ensure that UK fiscal rules and the plan for deficit reduction continue to be consistent with the terms of the Stability pact and that he has underlined his commitment to avoid an excessive deficit. His intention to lower the inflation target, if international conditions permit, is important. It may foster convergence of UK-inflation on the lower inflation levels in many other EU countries. I would like to recall that the core of EMU is the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates. A single monetary policy, a single currency and a common Central Bank are impossible without it. Reflecting this, Article 109j of the Treaty requires exchange rate stability as an entry criterion for EMU; the related Protocol requires a country to respect the normal fluctuation margins of the ERM for at least two years without severe tensions and, particularly devaluations of bilateral central rates. For countries with a derogation, the Treaty emphasises that exchange rates are a matter of \"common interest\".  As regards current performance in the EU in relation to convergence, progress has been made in respect of the downward convergence of inflation, which illustrates the determination of the national central banks across the entire Union to pursue price stability as the objective of monetary policy. In no less than fourteen countries, inflation, observed over a period of 12 months was below the reference value calculated according to the Treaty on the basis of harmonised figures recently published for July 1997. This was against the background of a historically low inflation rate for the Union as a whole of below 2%. There has also been considerable progress in bond yield convergence and - with some exceptions - exchange rate stability has, over the last couple of years, been broadly maintained throughout the EU.  However, on the fiscal side, the sustainability of public finances in EU countries remains an issue. The latest official data show that in 1996 many EU countries were above the reference values for public deficits and debt ratios laid down in the convergence criteria. Reflecting this situation, the EMI\\'s report entitled \"Progress towards convergence 1996\" concluded that \"most countries had not yet achieved a situation which, in a broader view, might be judged as sustainable in the medium term\". For 1997, the recent autumn forecasts from bodies such as the Commission and the IMF suggest that most countries are expected to meet the \"headline\" reference values for public finances in respect of public deficits, and to have a declining debt ratio although the projections are still to be confirmed by outcomes. To assess the soundness and durability of the correction of public finances which will be shown by the final data for 1997 available in early 1998, the EMI will, inter alia, take careful note of the potential impact of temporary or \"one-off\" measures adopted by various countries in order to comply with the convergence criteria on deficits and debt in 1997. Sustainability will be examined from both a backward and forward looking perspective. Our final view will be expressed in the Convergence Report to be produced under Article 109(j) and published (together with a similar report produced by the European Commission) in the spring of 1998.  Convergence is not only required in macroeconomic terms, but also in legal terms. The achievement of central bank independence is an important precondition in order to qualify for participation in EMU. This obligation of legal convergence does not require the full harmonisation of central banks\\' statutes. It does, however, imply that national legislation and the statutes of central banks will need to be adjusted before the ESCB is established in order to eliminate incompatibilities with the Treaty in respect of features such as institutional, personal, functional and financial independence. The EMI has developed a list of the remaining incompatibilities which could serve as guidance for national legislators. Considerable progress has been made by Member States in adapting the statutes of their respective central banks in order to comply with the requirements arising from the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB/ECB. The statutes of some central banks, require further adaptation, in particular with a view to their legal integration into the ESCB. An updated report on legal convergence has just been issued.   2 Exchange rate issues  Speaking here among industrialists, I need hardly stress the importance of exchange rate stability to trade and international investment. One of the main benefits of EMU is after all the elimination of exchange rate volatility, notably the risk of medium-term deviations of exchange rates from fundamentals which have often been observed historically - not least in this country. In discussing progress towards EMU, I should like to focus on two issues linked to foreign exchange policy which should be helpful in this regard.   First, I welcome the recent political decision by the ECOFIN meeting, on a recommendation by the EMI, to pre-announce the bilateral conversion rates applicable to the currencies of participants in Monetary Union at the time of their selection. This should reduce the risk of exchange rate instability in the so-called interim period prior to the irrevocable fixing of the euro exchange rates against the euro-area currencies which is set to take place on 1 January 1999. The so-called \"pre pre-announcement\" was well received by market participants and seen as a sign of commitment to the EMU process. It will in my view also have to be complemented by strengthened cooperation in the conduct of monetary policies. This is essential not only for a stable development in the interim period but also because monetary conditions at the beginning of Stage Three depend on the stance of monetary policy prior to its commencement.   Second, given that not all Member States are likely to participate from the start of Stage Three, the exchange rate relationship between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries will be of great importance.  Following preparatory work by the EMI, the European Council adopted a resolution on the new mechanism (ERM II) in Amsterdam in June of this year, and a draft Central Bank Agreement to be signed by the Executive Board of the ECB and the NCBs concerned has been almost finalised. ERM II includes the following features: It will be based on central rates, defined vis-à-vis the euro for non-euro area currencies. A standard fluctuation band will be established for these currencies around their central rates. The margins of the standard fluctuation band will be relatively wide: +/-15%. Central rates and the standard wide band will be set by mutual agreement between the ECB, the Ministers of the euro area Member States and Ministers and Governors of the central banks of the non-euro area Member States. The ECB will have the right to initiate a realignment and the possibility of suspending intervention and financing if these were to threaten the pursuit of price stability. The ERM II allows for forms of closer exchange rate co-operation between non-euro area NCBs and the ECB agreed on a case-by-case basis.   3 The changeover and preparations in the private sector  Following the agreement on the EMI\\'s plan for the changeover to the euro at the 1995 Madrid summit, the ESCB will conduct its monetary policy operations in euro as of 1 January 1999 and Monetary Union Member States will issue all new debt in euro. Most Monetary Union Member States also envisage redenominating their outstanding debt in euro from the start of Stage Three. A broad timetable for the rest of the changeover has been finalised. The preparations for the changeover to the euro have gained considerable momentum over the past twelve months. National changeover scenarios have been defined in most EU countries. Meanwhile, the legal framework for the changeover process has been substantiated in two Council Regulations which will form the lex monetae of the Community. Most importantly, the lex monetae will ensure the continuity of contracts denominated in euro or in the former national currencies, which will be treated as if they were in euro. One element still to be agreed is the common date of introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.In line with subsidiarity, the practical arrangements for the changeover will have to be made by the EU Member States. \"Fine-tuning\" at the Community level is deemed to be neither possible nor desirable. I note that a standing committee has been set up to co-ordinate preparations in the United Kingdom.  As industrialists, you will certainly be aware of the need to prepare for the implications of the changeover to the euro. It is evident that in parallel with the public preparations, there has been an increasing amount of investment by the private sector in the adaptation of systems and procedures across the entire Union, notably by banks, other financial institutions and large non-financial companies. But we should not be complacent; in many area, there remains a great deal of work to be done.  Banks are acting collectively. Recently, eight EU-wide banking associations and two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs) submitted a \"joint statement on market conventions for the euro\" to the EMI. Their statement - subsequently supported by several other banking associations - is a non-binding catalogue of market standards which are proposed by the signatory associations to issuers of financial instruments and other market participants for inclusion in new wholesale financial products after the start of EMU. The EMI has welcomed and supported the initiative. In discussions with the EMI, representatives of some EU-wide banking associations have also stressed that they would favour the ESCB participating in a neutral manner in the calculation of an overnight reference rate to be used in the context of derivatives contracts for the euro area. The EMI Council has agreed to assist in the calculation of this rate, although it will not take responsibility for its specification or publication.   4 Technical preparations for the single monetary policy  The EMI is responsible for preparing the framework that will enable the ESCB to perform its monetary policy tasks in Stage Three. Given the lead times involved, progress was essential at an early stage in the preparation of a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures - the operational framework of the ESCB, which will be necessary to control interest rates. Preparations are on track. As required by the Treaty, in January of this year the EMI published a report entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: Specification of the operational framework\". The report confirmed that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations, in most cases employing reverse transactions, but that it will also offer two standing facilities (a marginal lending facility and a deposit facility), and that a broad range of counterparties will have access to ESCB operations. Preparations have also been made for an infrastructure that will allow the ECB, if it so chooses, to impose minimum reserve requirements. The EMI has just published a further report on the subject of monetary policy instruments and procedures, the so-called \"General documentation\", which updates the operational framework, taking account of recent progress made in its specification. The main aim of this report is to provide financial institutions with the information they will need to prepare for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations in Stage Three.  While the Treaty provides unambiguous guidance as to the ultimate objective of the ESCB, namely price stability, it does not specify the monetary strategy to be adopted. In this context, early decisions were less crucial, since the adoption of a strategy requires relatively less preparation and does not require action from others to implement it. Nevertheless, as a basis for the ECB Council\\'s later decision, the EMI published an assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies in February of this year, entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: Elements of the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB\". It identified two potential strategies, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. Overall, it concluded that the similarities in the behaviour of those central banks that pursue these two strategies are greater than the differences; they all monitor a wide and similar set of economic and financial variables as indicators in determining the monetary policy stance.  Preparation of the infrastructure needed to pursue either strategy has also advanced. For example, the estimation of econometric forecasting models is under way and research on a number of topics linked to the analysis and monitoring of the conjunctural situation in Stage Three is ongoing. Moreover, work has been under way for some time on the statistical infrastructure for EMU. In this respect, the EMI has recently issued a provisional list of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) - primarily intended for use by reporting institutions and compilers of statistics -, in support of its aim to produce a homogeneous reporting population for the production of properly articulated money and banking statistics in Stage Three. A future Addendum will cover Money Market Funds.  In order to ensure that a single interest rate obtains across the euro area, it is essential that payment systems be fully integrated. In early 1995 the EMI Council agreed to establish the TARGET system of linked real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems; since then, besides specifying the system in two reports, we have focused on elaborating the organisational aspects of TARGET, the technical implementation of the system and the associated legal issues. The EMI has just published a further progress report, covering detailed issues such as the harmonisation of the operating time of domestic RTGS systems linked to TARGET and pricing policy, as well as providing further information regarding the provision of intraday liquidity to non-euro area NCBs.  Technical preparations also include forging an agreement on the organisation of the ESCB itself and how it operates. The main issues outstanding as regards the degree of centralisation and decentralisation of operations within the ESCB have been resolved. However, one significant challenge in the coming months will be to determine the functions and the structure of the ECB. In this context, I consider it likely that around 500 staff members will be required initially. Further consideration is now being given to institutional issues, in particular the form which co-operation between the ECB and the NCBs will take.   5 The outlook for monetary policy in Stage Three   Finally, I should like to turn to a few more general considerations concerning the task of the ESCB in Stage Three. As you know, the core task of a central bank is to safeguard the purchasing power of money or, to put it differently, to create a zone of monetary stability. The concept of monetary stability comprises in any case the requirement that money has a stable internal value - that there is price stability. When foreign countries also adhere to price stability, this creates favourable conditions for the currency to have a stable external value of the currency, in other words, exchange rate stability.  A growing number of central banks throughout the world have been given the legal mandate to ensure price stability. As I have already observed, such a mandate also applies in the case of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). Following a definition which has been advocated by my colleagues Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, price stability obtains when the public no longer takes account of actual or prospective inflation in its decision-making. A rate of consumer price inflation not exceeding 2% is probably consistent with this definition. Some European central banks have indeed set themselves quantitative monetary or inflation targets that reflect this benchmark for price stability.  How does exchange rate stability fit in? For several EU countries it has proved highly beneficial in past decades to aim for a stable external value of the currency against the strongest and most credible EU currencies as the key to achieving price stability. In contrast, some central banks of other, usually larger, EU countries have preferred to focus their monetary policy directly on the achievement of price stability and thereby also to lay the foundations for a stable exchange rate. While this has allowed them to set official interest rates in line with domestic price requirements, these were nonetheless influenced by the interaction between exchange rate developments and inflation. As experience has shown, the success of either form of monetary policy orientation depends crucially on the support of economic policies directed at sound public finances, responsible wage behaviour and efficient markets.  In Stage Three of EMU, the ESCB will carry out its mandate of ensuring price stability in a somewhat different economic environment, comparable to the situation of the Federal Reserve in the United States. The euro area will be a large internal market with strong trade relations among its partners stimulated by the existence of a single currency. As a natural consequence, trade flows with the rest of the world will be relatively small. This will allow the ESCB to focus primarily on \"domestic\" inflationary risks and to consider fluctuations in the euro exchange rate only to the extent that these significantly affect \"domestic\" prices. This also explains why any so-called orientations that might be formulated by the ECOFIN Council in the field of exchange rate policy for the euro area will have to be limited to exceptional circumstances. As stated in the Treaty, such general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability.  Some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that the ESCB will no longer be concerned about output and employment growth. I believe this view to be wrong. Rather, stable prices are a condition for sound growth and the sustainable creation of employment. A stable price and financial environment also enhances the capacity of monetary policy to react appropriately to cyclical weakness in the economy. A central bank\\'s long-term commitment to price stability does not mean that monetary policy will ignore the short-term impact of economic events and developments in the business cycle. When price stability is established and the credibility of the central bank in respect of its efforts to safeguard that goal is not in doubt, monetary policy can effectively play a role in stabilising the business cycle, if price pressures are least at the low point in the business cycle.   Conclusions  To conclude, the main challenge still remaining in the EMU process is to ensure that the countries entering Stage Three of EMU are fully qualified to do so. Progress towards price and exchange rate stability as well as bond yield convergence is promising but fiscal consolidation remains a key issue; the analyses of the EMI and the Commission of the degree of convergence due early next year, will show the extent to which countries\\' undoubted efforts are considered to have resulted in sustainable positions. Meanwhile, foreign exchange policies vis-à-vis countries not initially participating in the euro area have been agreed in ERM II and the recent decision to pre-announce bilateral conversion rates should help to avoid instability in the interim period. Banking associations have put forward catalogues of market standards, while individual institutions are undertaking their own technical preparations.  The overall preparations for the operating framework for monetary policy in Stage Three are well on track, as is the accompanying infrastructure. The monetary strategy options have been set out in detail for decision by the Governing Council of the ECB, and the accompanying infrastructure will be prepared so that we may start mimicking the procedures for the preparation of day-to-day policymaking during the second half of 1998. On balance, provided the choice of the Member States adopting the euro is credible, the institutional arrangements for the ESCB and the preparations that have been made to date will ensure that the euro will be a stable currency and that the ESCB will be a strong institution, safeguarding the value of the new currency./.

Duisenberg,President of the European Monetary Institute,at the Conference on \"European Monetary Union: Prospects for EuropeanFinancial Markets\"Paris, 22 October 1997', '  The European System of Central Banks: a profile   Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg,President of the European Monetary Institute,at the Conference on \"European Monetary Union: Prospects for EuropeanFinancial Markets\"Paris, 22 October 1997  1. Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen, it is no exaggeration to state that the establishment of the European System of Central Banks - or ESCB - at the latest in about eight months\\' time, and of the euro fourteen months from now, ranks among the most significant developments in the international monetary system during the post-war period.  My task today is to describe the profile of the new institution which will be in charge of managing the euro. It is not an easy task, you will concur, because this institution does not yet exist. It is being built. What I intend to do is to examine the main pillars on which the institution is being built. I will distinguish three main pillars: first, the ESCB blueprint as contained in the EC Treaty; second, the substance given to that blueprint by the EMI\\'s preparatory work; and third, the continuity with the European central bank experience.   2. The ESCB blueprint: key elements  The key elements of the blueprint for the ESCB were spelt out in 1989, when the so-called Committee for the Study of EMU - better known as the Delors Committee - submitted its report to the European Council meeting in Madrid. The sixteen members of this Committee comprised all twelve EU central bank Governors at that time, acting in their personal capacity. (Incidentally, both the previous as well as the current EMI President sat on that Committee.)  The Committee advocated the establishment of an independent central banking authority to conduct the single monetary policy geared towards achieving price stability. Its key characteristics, including its federal structure, the role of the national central banks within that structure and the relationship between independence and accountability, are contained in one single paragraph (paragraph 32) of the Committee\\'s 1989 report, the thrust of which has remained unchallenged ever since.  The draft Statute of the ESCB and the ECB, which the Committee of Governors subsequently prepared, was by and large adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference. Its core elements are reflected in the Treaty:      Article 105 states that the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability;    Articles 107, 108 and 109a deal with various aspects of the independence of the ESCB;    Article 109b (3) refers to the accountability of the ESCB.      I would like to say a few words to clarify these three key features of the ESCB Statute.  First, let me start with the primary objective of price stability. I do not need to justify the importance of this objective for monetary policy. It is now widely agreed - not only in the central banking community but also in the academic world and among financial market practitioners - that only a monetary policy geared towards price stability can create the conditions for sustainable economic growth. An important element that may be worth mentioning, nevertheless, is that for the ESCB the objective of price stability concerns the whole euro area. It is the price level of the whole euro area that the single monetary policy will aim at stabilising. There will not be, and there could not be, differentiated policies for each region or country in the euro area, depending on the inflationary conditions prevailing there.  The second important feature of the ESCB Statute is its independence. Independence is established in four main areas: institutional independence, personal independence, functional independence and financial independence.  To summarise, institutional independence protects the ESCB from interference by other bodies in the pursuit of its statutory objectives. Personal independence provides the members of the ESCB decision-making bodies with the necessary security of tenure and avoids conflicts of interest with a view to ensuring that they can be in a position to fulfil their duties. Functional independence aims at providing the ESCB with all the necessary instruments to perform its functions. Finally, financial independence is established with a view to ensuring that the ESCB can avail itself autonomously of the appropriate economic means to fulfil its mandate.  In all these areas, it is recognised that the ESCB has been granted a high degree of independence, consistent with the desire of the political authorities that signed the Maastricht Treaty to put the ESCB in the best possible position to achieve its primary objective. The Treaty also requires that the Statutes of the national central banks are adapted to conform with that of the ESCB. This process is under way and the Statutes of the NCBs, even those that were recognised as being among the most independent, are being upgraded to satisfy the ESCB\\'s requirements.  The ESCB will also have clear reporting commitments. The Treaty describes all the requirements, in particular with respect to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Council. These define the context in which the ESCB will give an account of its own activities and performance with respect to the achievement of its primary objective. Beyond these very precise reporting procedures one should not overlook the fact that, ultimately, the ESCB will be accountable to the European citizens on its ability to defend the purchasing power of their money holdings. If the ESCB does not perform a good job with respect to its primary objective, it will be penalised by the citizens, as savers, who will reduce their holdings of money balances and ask for higher returns to compensate for the depreciation of their currency. The strength of the currency is the ultimate judgement of savers on the performance of the central bank.  A final point that I would like to underline concerns the institutional relationship between the ESCB and the authorities in charge of economic policy in the Community.  The Treaty has provided for a number of communication channels between what one could call the political (or budgetary) and the monetary arms of the single currency area, meaning the Council and the ECB. This is perfectly compatible with the requirement of an independent central bank and I see no reason why the ESCB should try to avoid contact with those responsible for the general economic policies in the Community, which the ESCB will support, without prejudice to its primary objective of maintaining price stability. As a matter of fact, it is very important that an exchange of information and views takes place between the ECB and the ECOFIN Council. There already exist formal and informal communication channels for both sides to explain to one another the policy actions for which they are responsible.   3. The EMI\\'s preparatory work in shaping the ESCB  Let me turn now to the technical side of the EMI\\'s preparatory work in shaping the ESCB. In essence, this work revolves around two questions:      How will the ESCB achieve its final objective of price stability - in other words, which monetary policy strategy should it pursue?    How will it effectively implement the single monetary policy - in other words, to be efficient, which instruments and procedures should it employ?      With regard to the monetary policy strategy or, if you wish, the set of procedures according to which the ESCB will decide how to achieve its final objective of price stability, the decision will be taken once the ESCB has been established.  The EMI Council has considered several possible candidate strategies and ultimately narrowed down the number of options to two, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. Any further narrowing down was considered neither necessary nor possible at this stage. The EMI is now preparing the common key building blocks of both strategies so that a final choice by the ECB Governing Council - which does not necessarily have to be an \"either/or\" choice - can be made fully operational in the latter part of 1998. Having at its disposal a monetary policy strategy fully capable of being implemented by the end of next year is a key element for the credibility of the ESCB.  Communication with the general public will also be essential. It will involve the public announcement of a quantified definition of what the ESCB understands to be price stability; publication of specific targets and details of their derivation - against which its policy performance can be assessed; and the explanation of deviations from the target and concomitant policy responses by the ESCB. This will increase the transparency of the ESCB\\'s actions and thereby enhance its accountability.  The second aspect concerns the practical implementation of the single monetary policy. The EMI has devised a set of instruments and procedures and a supporting framework which can be used in a decentralised way by the national central banks, whenever possible and appropriate, so that they can act as the operational arms of the System. Reliance on the infrastructure and operational experience built up by the national central banks will prove a valuable asset. Given that the ESCB needs to be cognisant of differences between financial market participants and structures in the EU, operating through the national central banks will ensure that it has the best possible knowledge of market conditions throughout the euro area.  It would not be useful for me to repeat here what has been described at length in various EMI publications on how the ESCB will conduct its business. You are certainly aware of the existence of the EMI\\'s specification of the operational framework for the single monetary policy which was made public in January of this year. Following up on this work, the EMI last month published two documents which provide further details of how the decentralised operational framework will function in the areas of monetary policy and payment systems respectively. I am referring here to the General Documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures and to the Second Progress Report on the TARGET Project.  To summarise, it is envisaged that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations to manage the liquidity situation of the market and steer interest rates; it will also offer two standing facilities, so as to enable banks to borrow or deposit reserves at the end of the day. The two facilities will bound overnight market interest rates and the interest rates applied to them will help signal the general stance of monetary policy. In addition, preparations are being made for an infrastructure that will allow the ESCB to impose minimum reserve requirements if the Council were to decide accordingly. It may serve the purpose of stabilising money market interest rates, creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the money market and possibly contributing to the control of monetary expansion.  What is crucial is that the system of monetary policy instruments will ensure that the Governing Council of the ECB is in a position to control the overall stance of monetary policy at all times, in conformity with the decision-making framework of the ESCB. Decisions will thus always be taken at the ECB, whereas implementation will, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, be executed in a decentralised manner by NCBs.  To give you an example of this allocation of responsibilities within the ESCB, let us consider the conduct of the main refinancing operations of the ESCB, which will provide the bulk of refinancing to the financial sector and which will be executed through standard tenders. The tender announcement will be made by the ECB, via public wire services, and supplemented by announcements by NCBs via national wire services and directly to individual counterparties. Submission of bids will be organised at the level of the NCBs. Tender allotment, involving the addition of all bids received, will be decided at the level of the ECB. The tender results will be announced by the ECB, and the NCBs will directly certify the individual allotment result to all counterparties that have submitted bids. Settlement will be effected in the books of the NCBs. These procedures make maximum use of the operational experience of the NCBs, they rely as much as possible on the existing infrastructure at the national level and they allow for the participation of a broad range of counterparties under conditions of equal treatment. In sum, these procedures will permit a solid operational involvement by the ESCB, as it continues to use elements of well-tested national practices in combination with harmonised elements conforming to decisions taken at the level of the ECB\\'s decision-making bodies.   4. Continuity with European central banking experience  The key question that is often put is: how will the ESCB take its decisions? How will it operate in the new environment in practice? It is often stated that the ESCB has no track record of its own and that it will have to establish its own credibility at the start. The impression is sometimes given that the ECB is created out of nothing. This is not correct. The creation of the ECB follows an evolutionary process that conditions not only its structure but also the way it will operate in practice.  Concerning its structure, there is clear continuity with the past. This pertains to both the status of the NCBs and to the monetary policy instruments and procedures that will be used by the ESCB, as I have already explained.  Concerning the way it will operate, there is no quantum jump here either. Let me just take as an example the recent official interest rate increases by a number of EU central banks. Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the price level, this move will produce its effect on the real economy after May of next year, when the list of initial participants in EMU is known and their bilateral conversion rates have been pre-announced. For this reason, it is essential that a high degree of monetary policy co-ordination is established so that the monetary policy conditions of the euro area in its initial phase are influenced by co-ordinated national central bank policies. The recent move is an example of such co-ordination. The same Governors who are conducting this co-ordinated monetary policy today will be members of the ECB Governing Council determining the single monetary policy in Stage Three. There is thus full continuity, although in a different institutional context, between the decision-making of today and that of the ESCB.  This seems to be confirmed by the behaviour of financial markets. Judging from long-term interest rates, market participants seem to be convinced that inflation will remain low in the euro area. Moreover, convergence of long-term interest rates towards the lowest level rather than the average indicates that expectations are of a strong euro, built on the credibility of the ESCB\\'s single monetary policy.  Of course, such expectations are not only influenced by the prospect of a strong ESCB. There are other factors at work, such as:  - the continuing reduction of budget deficits;  - the prospective current account surplus of the euro area; and  - the potential role of the euro as a reserve currency.  In general, economic performance in the Community over the last few years has made very big strides towards convergence and this convergence has gone in the direction of the best possible performance, not the average. Inflation has been brought down to levels not seen since the 1960s; long-term interest rates have been converging to the German level, which itself is near the lower end of its observed historical range. Budget deficits have been declining at a slower pace, but, as the recent forecasts of the European Commission show, retrenchment is set to continue over the coming years, taking advantage of faster economic growth rates in Europe. The markets have fully understood these developments, which are reflected in European long-term yields.  Once Monetary Union is there, budgetary policy will be subject to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact with its accompanying Council Regulations on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure and on the strengthening of surveillance in the Community. Further enhancements to economic policy co-ordination in Stage Three may still be forthcoming. I will not dwell on these matters any further as they are evidently outside the EMI\\'s sphere of competence. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the contribution that a monetary policy geared to price stability can make towards balanced growth and employment will be significantly boosted when underpinned by other conditioning fiscal and structural policies. This will, in turn, enhance the standing of the ESCB.   5. Conclusion: a strong ESCB as a credible guardian of a stable euro  In conclusion, the Treaty already provided the blueprint of a solid ESCB able to achieve independently its primary objective. The EMI\\'s preparatory work is seeing to it that this ESCB, acting as a credible guardian of a stable euro, is in the making, in conjunction with the other elements of a stability-oriented policy framework, outside the realm of monetary policy. I am therefore confident that this newly created central banking system, which has an ECB equipped with all the necessary euro area-wide expertise and which builds on the credibility of equally strong NCBs for the execution of its policy, will be able to achieve its objective. I am also convinced that the ESCB will enjoy the area-wide public support for the benefits to be derived from a low-inflation environment and it will go to great length to continuously \"earning\" that support by being transparant. The single monetary policy will thus be seen as making a valuable contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the Community./.   ']\n",

Duisenberg', '1999 - A new European monetary system', 'Speech by Wim Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the conference \"The euro and the European innovative industry\" in Toulouse, France, on 17 October 1997', '  1999 - A new European monetary system   Speech by Wim Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the conference \"The euro and the European innovative industry\" in Toulouse, France, on 17 October 1997  Introduction  Stage Three of Monetary Union is little more than 14 months away. Preparations for this historic project are underway. As far as the EMI is concerned, the operational framework for the ESCB\\'s monetary policy has been defined and specified; we have entered the stage of technical implementation.  EMU will contribute to the creation of a large zone of monetary stability in Europe. The euro, in particular, will be a strong and stable currency that will foster further economic and financial integration among member countries, thereby completing the internal market. It can be expected, nevertheless, that not all countries will initially participate in the euro area. Some may opt out; others might not yet be ready by 1 January 1999 as regards economic convergence. The question thus arises of how to avoid that the euro produces divisions within the European Union, between those that are in the euro area and those that are outside, with potential foreign exchange turbulences that endanger the internal market.  There are several ways to tackle this question. I would like, first, to remind that, except for the opt-out countries, the Treaty establishes a political commitment for all EU countries to join the euro area and to adopt policies consistent with this aim. This, by itself, will create a strong drive towards adopting sustainable economic policies that ensure stability and macroeconomic convergence. In this respect, the creation of the euro represents a catalyst, a force of attraction, that should foster stability also in the other EU countries.  Another aspect to keep in mind is that the Treaty foresees a number of explicit mechanisms for monitoring and co-ordinating Member States\\' economic policies such as, for instance, the annual broad guidelines for economic policies and the multilateral surveillance process which are required for member countries, independently from whether they are in the euro area or not. Such co-ordination aims at promoting convergence of policies and economic developments, thereby contributing to exchange rate stability. In this respect, the Treaty provision that exchange rates need to be treated by the Member States as a matter of common interest aims at avoiding that exchange rate developments create distortions within the EU.  To supplement these Treaty provisions, an exchange rate mechanism between the euro and the currencies of the other EU countries has been designed; it is ERM2.  ERM2 has been designed in close co-operation between the European Council, the Council of Ministers and the EMI. The EMI has contributed to this process in particular through its detailed report annexed to the conclusions of the European Council of Dublin in December 1996. On the basis of this document, the European Council adopted a Resolution on the ERM2 at its meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997. In parallel, the EMI has completed the Central Bank Agreement dealing with the operational aspects, which will be submitted for signature to the ECB and the non-euro area national central banks in 1998. The EMI is currently setting up the required technical infrastructure to ensure that the arrangement will be fully operational from 1 January 1999.  I would like to address with you today three main issues related to ERM2. First, what are its objectives and principles? Second, which are the main features? Third, what can be expected from ERM2 in terms of contributing to monetary and exchange rate stability and thus creating a favourable business environment within Europe?   1. Objectives and principles of the ERM2  Five main objectives and principles have guided the creation of ERM2.   First, as I already mentioned, Member States are required to treat their exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest. This is not only a Treaty requirement but a necessary condition with a view to avoiding that the single market is damaged by excessive exchange rate fluctuations.   Second, exchange rate stability is an important element of economic convergence. As you are well aware, the Treaty\\'s convergence criteria include the observance of the normal ERM fluctuation margins without severe tensions for at least two years. In particular, a Member State is not allowed to devalue its currency\\'s bilateral central rate against any other Member State\\'s currency on its own initiative. Member States joining the euro area, including those entering at a later stage, have all to fulfil this condition.   Third, anchoring the exchange rate to a stable currency, as the euro will be, can be of help for non-euro Member States in their convergence efforts necessary to enter the euro area. It establishes a focal point for agents\\' expectations and may enhance the credibility of stability-oriented policies.   Fourth, exchange rate stability can be achieved only in the presence of continued convergence of economic fundamentals - in particular price stability - and sound fiscal and structural policies. Unless these conditions are met, there is no point - and it may even be counterproductive - to try to artificially stabilise exchange rates.   Fifth, ERM2 should ensure, as far as possible, continuity with the present exchange rate mechanism. At the same time, the arrangement must fully take account of the new economic and institutional environment in Stage Three. I would underline in this respect the ECB\\'s and the non-euro area national central banks\\' statutory requirement to maintain price stability, which must be safeguarded.  A final point that needs to be mentioned is that participation in ERM2 will, as in the present ERM, be voluntary. Nevertheless, the Dublin and Amsterdam European Council conclusions have stated that a Member State with a derogation can be expected to join the mechanism.   2. Main features of ERM2  The main operational features of ERM 2 may be summarised under four points.   First, for each participating non-euro area currency, a central rate vis-à-vis the euro will be defined. Unlike the present ERM, there will no longer be a \"parity grid\". The new so-called \"hub-and-spokes\" approach puts the euro at the centre of the system. Around the euro central rates, a standard fluctuation band of +/- 15% will be established. This rather wide band reflects the good experience with the operation of the current ERM. It avoids offering \"one-way bets\" in periods of speculative pressure. It also allows temporary deviations from the central rates to accommodate minor asymmetric economic disturbances. The recent experience in the ERM has shown that central rates exert a strong magnetic force for exchange rates, thus contributing to avoiding misalignments. In practice, exchange rate fluctuations have, for most currencies, proved to be even more limited than in the former 2.25% narrow band of the ERM. This effect has been reinforced after the decision taken at the Mondorf Informal ECOFIN in mid-September to announce bilateral conversion rates in May 1998.  In summary, ERM2 is an asymmetric system, centred around the euro. There have been in the past many discussions concerning the asymmetric nature of the current exchange rate mechanism, and the desirability of this asymmetry. I think that there can be no doubt that ERM2 will have to be asymmetric, given the euro area\\'s size and the stability-oriented policies that will be pursued in the euro area, in particular by the European System of Central Banks.  A second feature is that central rates and the standard wide band will be set by mutual agreement between all parties. These parties are the euro-area Finance Ministers, the ECB, and the Finance Ministers and central bank Governors of the non-euro area Member States participating in ERM2. The European Commission will, as today, be involved in the procedure. All parties to the agreement, including the ECB, will have the right to initiate a procedure for reconsidering central rates. This will ensure that any adjustment of central rates will be conducted in a timely fashion.  A third feature is that, as today, there will be automatic and unlimited foreign exchange intervention and financing when exchange rates reach the fluctuation margins. As a general principle, it is understood that intervention will have to be used to support - not replace - other policy measures, including appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. Furthermore, an explicit safeguard clause has been introduced, and this is new, by which both the ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs are allowed to suspend intervention and financing if these were to impinge on their price stability objective. The central banks participating in the agreement will retain the possibility of co-ordinated intramarginal intervention, to be decided by mutual agreement in parallel with other appropriate policy responses.   Finally, there is the possibility to have closer links between non-euro area NCBs and the ECB. A non-euro area Member State that has reached an advanced degree of convergence with the euro area may request closer exchange rate co-operation. This may take various forms. It can entail participation in formal narrower bands, to be agreed upon in a procedure analogous to that for central rate decisions. Alternatively, informal arrangements can be made, for instance target ranges, which might not be made public.   3. How will ERM2 contribute to monetary and exchange rate stability in the EU?  I believe that the new arrangement is equipped with the necessary devices to contribute to exchange rate stability in Europe. Naturally, these features and instruments will have be used in an appropriate way. The existence of a system in itself is not a guarantee for stability. The experience of the last few years is nevertheless encouraging. There is now a common understanding on the way economic policies should be conducted in the ERM framework, with a view to fostering sustainable exchange rate stability. I would like to be more specific in this respect and examine with you how, I think, ERM 2 can be expected to foster stability.  I would distinguish four main aspects.   First, the ERM2 provides a framework to counter major competitive distortions within Europe. It will do so primarily by providing a policy co-operation mechanism through which monetary stability is fostered in countries not initially participating in the euro area. This forms an important pre-condition for stable exchange rates. On the other hand, ERM2 provides a way to initiate timely realignments of the central rates vis-à-vis the euro if prices and costs in the non-euro area countries still diverge with respect to the euro area. This ensures that major distortions do no longer build up, leading to misalignments. The experience of the so-called \"hard ERM\" between 1987 and 1992 by which nominal exchange rate stability was not accompanied in some cases with adequate convergence of prices and costs, is unlikely to be repeated. The brusque adjustment of exchange rates to compensate for the accumulated differences in inflation rates will be avoided as realignments will take place more promptly.  Looking at ERM experience since the widening of the fluctuation bands, it is evident that the authorities have been quite successful in avoiding misalignments. Building on this positive track record, ERM2 seems to be fully equipped with all the necessary devices to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations within the Union.  The second way in which ERM2 will contribute to a stable monetary environment within the EU is by limiting short-term exchange rate volatility. As I have already mentioned, the widening of the fluctuation bands has reduced the incentive for market participants to test the sustainability of the narrow margins. A two-way risk arises as exchange rates move away from central rates, thereby discouraging speculative attacks. The most recent experience is encouraging in this sense. In 1997, exchange rate volatility among ERM currencies has been the lowest since 1992.  The ERM2\\'s flexibility also allows for closer - formal or informal - exchange rate links, where this is appropriate in the light of economic convergence and the policy strategy pursued by the respective country. All in all, ERM2 can be expected to reduce short-term exchange rate uncertainty. This will be to the benefit of European exporters and importers.   Third, participation in ERM2 implies the commitment to stability-oriented fiscal and monetary policies. It also implies a commitment to structural reforms with a view to facilitating the longer-term adjustment of the economy and entry into the euro area. This commitment to sound economic policies is further enhanced by the reinforced monitoring of convergence policies which will accompany the establishment of ERM2.  Let me elaborate a little on these procedures. From the start of Stage Three, all EU countries - both those participating and those not participating in the euro area - have to avoid excessive deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact will also apply to the non-euro area countries, except for a few provisions referring to sanctions. Equally, the reinforcement of the multilateral surveillance of budgetary positions and the co-ordination of economic policies fully involves both the euro area and the non-euro countries. Thus, all non-euro area countries have to submit convergence programmes. If a risk of slippage from the medium-term budgetary objective arises, an early-warning procedure is established.   Finally, by providing assistance and incentives for economic convergence, ERM2 is a way to support countries not initially participating in the euro area to join as soon as possible. Over time, the larger the euro area, the larger the area where the benefits of the single currency - such as the elimination of exchange transaction costs or the elimination of any residual exchange rate uncertainty - can be obtained.   Conclusions  Overall, ERM2 is equipped with the necessary instruments to ensure exchange rate stability and to avoid that the move to the euro creates tensions and segregation in the European Union.  I am fully aware that what I have been talking about until now may sound a bit theoretical. I do not want to shy away from the real question that you want to be tackled, which I believe is:  How can it be avoided that a country not entering the euro area from the start is \"left out in the cold\", to use the expression of an academic, with the consequence of severe exchange rate tensions, depreciation, competitive distortions that are a detriment not only to the country itself but also to the economies of the euro area?  I am fully aware that ERM2 provides only part of the answer. It represents a framework for monetary and foreign exchange policy co-operation; it does not ensure by itself that the right policies are in the end implemented, in particular in the countries outside the euro area. ERM2 is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient. But I believe that the creation of the euro will represent an additional impulse for further economic integration in Europe.  In other words, I believe that the euro need not be a factor of division of Europe but rather will have the potential of becomig an instrument for accelerating its integration./.   ']\n",

Duisenberg', 'Monetary stability and economic growth or: Why stable prices are good for private enterprise in France and the Netherlands', 'Speech delivered by Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, to the French/Dutch Chamber of Commerce in The Hague, 14 October 1997', '  Monetary stability and economic growth or: Why stable prices are good for private enterprise in France and the Netherlands   Speech delivered by Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, to the French/Dutch Chamber of Commerce in The Hague, 14 October 1997 I shall today address a subject which is very familiar to central bankers: namely, the relationship between monetary stability, monetary policy and economic growth. More particularly, I would like to focus my remarks on the benefits of stable prices for private enterprise.   MONETARY STABILITY IN EMU  As you know, the core task of a central bank is to safeguard the purchasing power of money or, to put it differently, to create a zone of monetary stability. The concept of monetary stability comprises in any case the requirement that money has a stable internal value or, to express this in more familiar terms, that there is price stability. Under specific circumstances, namely when foreign countries also adhere to price stability, this also creates favourable conditions for a stable external value of the currency, in other words, exchange rate stability. Let me dwell for a moment on these two aspects of monetary stability, their interlinkages and their relative weight in formulating monetary policy in Europe.  A growing number of central banks throughout the world have been given the legal mandate to ensure price stability. Such a mandate also applies in the case of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), as the Maastricht Treaty explicitly states that \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". Following a definition which has been advocated by my colleagues Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, price stability obtains when the public no longer takes account of actual or prospective inflation in its decision-making. What this definition actually means in operational terms is somewhat difficult to specify, given the various available statistical measures of inflation - that is, of the increase in the general price level. Moreover, there is a degree of upward bias in measured inflation. Taking this into account, however, one could say that a rate of consumer price inflation not exceeding 2% is probably not far off what central banks would normally be quite satisfied with. Some European central banks have indeed set themselves quantitative monetary or inflation targets that reflect this benchmark for price stability.  Let me now move on to the external aspect of monetary stability, namely that of a stable exchange rate. For several EU countries it has proved highly beneficial in the past decades to aim for a stable external value of the currency against the strongest and most credible EU currencies as the key to achieving price stability. In small open economies, the existence of close trade relations is a further major justification for such an indirect approach to fighting inflation, as a stable currency removes an artificial barrier to international competition and thus promotes trade with other partners. In contrast, some central banks of other, usually larger, EU countries have preferred to focus their monetary policy directly on the achievement of price stability and thereby also to lay the foundations for a stable exchange rate. While this has allowed them to set official interest rates in line with domestic price requirements, these were nonetheless influenced by the interaction between exchange rate developments and inflation. As experience has shown, the success of either form of monetary policy orientation depends crucially on the support of economic policies directed at sound public finances, responsible wage behaviour and efficient markets.  In Stage Three of EMU, the ESCB will carry out its mandate of ensuring price stability in a somewhat different economic environment, comparable to the situation of the Federal Reserve in the United States. The euro area will be a large internal market with strong trade relations among its partners stimulated by the existence of a single currency. As a natural consequence, trade flows with the rest of the world will be rather small. This allows the ESCB to focus primarily on \"domestic\" inflationary risks and to consider fluctuations in the euro exchange rate only to the extent that these significantly affect \"domestic\" prices. This also explains why it has now been agreed that any so-called orientations that might be formulated by the ECOFIN Council in the field of exchange rate policy for the euro area will be limited to exceptional circumstances. As stated in the Treaty, such general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability.  Against this background, some people have asked me \"Where does all this leave economic growth?\" Behind this question seems to be the idea that the ESCB could - or even should - use monetary policy to promote growth and employment in EMU, especially in view of the high level of unemployment in Europe. In answer to this question, I refer to the Statutes of the ESCB which stipulate that \"without prejudice to the objective of price stability, it shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to the achievement of the objectives of the Community\", which include inter alia sustained non-inflationary growth and a high level of employment. Also relevant in this context is the sentence that the ESCB \"shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources\".  Before I go on to discuss the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in more detail, it may be useful to recall the costs of inflation - or, to put it differently, the reasons why a climate of price stability provides substantial benefits, especially for private enterprise. My remarks should make clear that I see no conflict between price stability and a balanced development of economic activity in EMU; on the contrary, a stable price environment provides excellent conditions for a flourishing market economy and thus supports a healthy creation of employment. Indeed, the best way for monetary policy to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Community is precisely by focusing on price stability.   BENEFITS OF PRICE STABILITY  To arrive at a clearer understanding of the economic and social costs of inflation it is helpful to distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated inflation. Let me start with the case of inflation which is fully expected. Although the public will normally have taken account of expected price increases in their economic decision-making, this aspect of inflation nonetheless imposes non-negligible costs. They relate in particular to attempts by the public to economise on non-interest-bearing money holdings, the need to constantly revise price lists, and the misallocation of resources due to the operation of tax systems which are not fully indexed. At first sight these costs might appear somewhat trivial. The truth of the matter is, however, that the efficiency losses can be very large.  This is perhaps most evident in the case of the tax argument. Taken by itself, the imposition of personal and corporate income taxes distorts the allocation of productive resources in a market-based economy because it leads to a bias towards current consumption relative to savings and investment. Recent academic studies have found that the interaction between inflation and income taxes has the unintended effect of exacerbating these distortions. Calculations for the United States suggest that the negative impact of 2 percentage points extra inflation could be as high as 1% of GDP on a permanent basis, in other words output is 1% lower each year. Although this outcome is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, similar work undertaken for some EU countries (Spain) broadly confirms the conclusion that reducing inflation and thereby the magnitude of tax distortions brings substantial benefits which, over the longer term, exceed the transitional disinflation costs. Given the adverse effects associated with inflation, it is thus worthwhile accepting the transitional sacrifices in output of moving to price stability.  The costs associated with unanticipated inflation are perhaps even more evident, as they arise above all from the uncertainty that goes with it. Clearly, an environment of stable prices offers a much more reliable basis for corporate decision-making. In evaluating investment opportunities, it is crucial for firms to be able to rely on the signals conveyed by relative price changes, as these will tell them whether or not it is profitable to engage in a certain productive activity. For this mechanism to function properly, firms must be able to discriminate between relative price adjustments and general changes in the price level. However, this is a particularly difficult exercise in periods of high and variable inflation. This also explains why the prospect of a single currency produces large benefits; it allows cross-border relative price comparisons to be made without the distorting influence of exchange rate fluctuations. The more reliable the information on relative prices, both nationally and across borders, the more an efficient allocation of scarce resources and the ability of a market economy to function properly is promoted.  The same positive result for resource allocation arises from the fact that in a non-inflationary environment firms are more willing to enter into long-term investment contracts. After all, when considering a long time period for evaluating costs and revenues they face a smaller risk of unanticipated inflation wiping out expected real profits. At times of high and variable inflation, however, they tend to prefer projects which promise a quick return on investment. In addition, the expected real return must be higher, because - with a higher degree of uncertainty over inflation - firms are confronted with a higher real cost of borrowing. This can be explained by the fact that financing costs tend to include an insurance premium to cover the risk of unexpected changes in the price level. A climate of stable prices thus offers companies substantial benefits in terms of lower real interest rates.  This brings me to one of the main arguments against inflation, namely the unintended redistributive consequences. Inflation effectively functions as a tax which, at random and without justification, causes a redistribution of income and wealth, especially if it comes unanticipated. Who will profit and who will lose from it, depends on whether and to what extent people are able to predict and neutralise the effects of inflation. The outcome of this process is uncertain, but all too often it is the weaker in society who cannot protect themselves and bear the brunt. Accepting high inflation is thus equivalent to allowing a social injustice to endure. Ultimately, this undermines the cohesion of society.  Another point to note in this context is that at times when wage increases are the driving force behind inflation, the macroeconomic income distribution tends to change to the benefit of employees and to the detriment of profits. On the one hand, wage rises in excess of labour productivity growth fuel domestic inflation, to the extent that firms succeed in passing on the increase in unit labour costs in domestic sales prices. On the other hand, firms facing international competition normally have to cut profit margins in response to higher unit labour costs, in order not to lose their share of the market. In many European economies - including France and the Netherlands - this two-way mechanism was clearly visible in the simultaneous rise of inflation and labour\\'s share of GDP in the 1970s and early 1980s. A reverse process was set in motion in the course of the 1980s: parallel to the decline in inflation the share of profits in GDP increased, which in turn offered opportunities for investment, output growth and employment.   MONETARY POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH  Having arrived at a clear view of the benefits of price stability, it is time to devote a few words to the question of what may be expected from the monetary policy of the ESCB in terms of support for growth and employment. Here, it would seem that some observers still live in the \"era of great expectations\" which characterised the 1970s, when expansionary policies were adopted in order to stimulate domestic demand, while neglecting their adverse consequences for price stability. Society has paid a high price for this illusion in terms of stagnating economic growth combined with high and volatile inflation. The lesson which should be taken to heart is that expectations must be realistic and not overburden the monetary policy of the ESCB. Let me elaborate this point.  First, the contribution that monetary policy can make towards balanced growth and employment is above all to provide for a stable price climate. However, it would be a tragic mistake to assume that the ESCB bears sole responsibility for establishing and maintaining price stability for the euro. Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound budgetary policies and wage developments in line with productivity growth. In other words, the overall policy mix must be appropriate. Without adequate support from other policy areas, the ESCB may be forced to take measures in the fight against inflation which entail a short-term loss in output and employment. This might have adverse consequences for the public\\'s opinion of monetary policy. However, these short-term sacrifices are justified in order to safeguard the foundations for balanced growth and employment in the longer run. This also explains why it is so important that the Maastricht Treaty assigns a high degree of independence to the ESCB in carrying out its mandate. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. As clarified in the Stability and Growth Pact, excessive deficits are only allowed in clearly defined exceptional circumstances. In addition, the Stability and Growth Pact specifies a procedure for a rapid correction of excessive deficits in euro countries should they nevertheless arise.  Second, one should realise that monetary policy in EMU applies to the euro area as a whole. As a consequence, it cannot be used for solving regional problems or country-specific economic shocks. These require above all well-functioning labour and product markets which allow wages and prices to adjust if local economic conditions have changed. In addition, national budgets must have sufficient room for manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers work. As a further element of the Stability and Growth Pact, all Member States have therefore committed themselves to the achievement of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term. Under normal circumstances, this should allow budget deficits to fluctuate around zero, while at the same time respecting the 3% ceiling as specified in a protocol to the Treaty.  Third, it is a well-known fact that the effects of monetary policy occur with long and variable lags. For this reason, it is impossible to use it for fine-tuning purposes. Monetary policy can only pursue price stability in the medium term. Once price stability is ensured, monetary policy may be used in such a way as to contribute to an automatic stabilisation of the business cycle, which means that this stabilisation does not require discretionary measures.  Fourth, sustainable growth and a healthy creation of employment require more than just an appropriate monetary policy. This can be aptly illustrated by the current unemployment problem in Europe. As its underlying causes are structural, its solution requires structural remedies and not an expansionary monetary policy. As the experience of recent years shows, those Member States that have undertaken fundamental labour market reforms have achieved both a strong recovery of employment and stable prices. At the same time, they often successfully managed to reduce their budget deficits. Accordingly, if all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, price stability will over the longer term go hand in hand with a balanced economic development.  The task is thus to ensure that in Stage Three of EMU an appropriate overall policy mix is achieved. For the monetary policy decisions of the ESCB to be well-informed and optimal with respect to its primary and secondary objectives, there is evidently a need for a regular dialogue and exchange of information on issues of common interest with third parties. This applies in particular to national economic policies, wage developments and the overall fiscal policy stance in the Monetary Union; under exceptional circumstances this could also include the exchange rate policy for the euro area. The question is how to organise such a constructive dialogue. The current situation in the Member States is that the Governor of the national central bank has a natural counterpart in the Minister of Finance, with whom frequent contacts exist, often on a weekly basis. In my previous capacity as Governor of the Nederlandsche Bank, I had, for example, regular lunch appointments with the Minister of Finance to discuss matters of common interest. In Stage Three of EMU the situation is more complicated, but the Treaty does contain some provisions in this regard (see Article 109b). On the one hand, the President of the ECOFIN Council (and also a member of the European Commission) may participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and submit motions for deliberation, without the right to vote. On the other hand, the President of the ECB will be invited to take part in meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB are on the agenda. Finally, in addition to national delegations (including the independent national central banks), two representatives of the ECB will participate in the preparatory meetings of the Economic and Financial Council, the successor to the current Monetary Committee. It would thus seem to me that the Treaty contains sufficient institutional provisions for the co-ordination between economic and monetary policy in the euro area.   CONCLUSION  Let me now come to a conclusion. First, I have argued that for the ESCB the concept of safeguarding monetary stability is to be interpreted as equivalent to the task of ensuring price stability. Given the large size of the euro area, the stability of the exchange rate of the euro area cannot be a direct policy focus but will have to be the outcome of the successful implementation of stability-oriented policies. Second, I have made clear that price stability is one of the pre-conditions for a flourishing market economy. Third, I have pointed out that for price stability in EMU to go hand in hand with sustainable growth and a healthy creation of employment, it is essential to have an appropriate overall policy mix. Fortunately, the Treaty contains sufficient institutional provisions to achieve a well-balanced combination of economic and monetary policy in EMU. I thank you for your attention./.   ']\n",
      "['1997-10-13', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'Hearing of the President of the EMI by the  Monetary Sub-Committee of the European Parliament', 'Introductory statement delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenbergon 13 October 1997', '  Hearing of the President of the EMI by the Monetary Sub-Committee of the European Parliament   Introductory statement delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenbergon 13 October 1997 It gives me particular pleasure to be able to address the members of the Monetary Sub-Committee of the European Parliament on the progress of the move to Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and on the main challenges which will affect, in the near future, the work of the European Monetary Institute (EMI).  As in previous years, the EMI continued to play a pivotal role in the preparations for EMU in 1997. In accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, its efforts have focused, on the one hand, on assessing the degree of sustainable convergence achieved by Member States in indication of their readiness to adopt the single currency and, on the other hand, on undertaking the necessary technical preparations required for the establishment of the ESCB.  Towards the end of March 1998 the EMI and the European Commission will be called upon to submit - to the European Parliament amongst others - their respective reports on the progress made by the Member States in the fulfilment of the necessary conditions for the achievement of EMU, the so-called \"convergence reports\". About one month later, having taken due account of these reports and of the opinion of the European Parliament, the Heads of State or Government will decide on the list of countries eligible to enter Monetary Union and will pre-announce the bilateral exchange rates between these countries\\' currencies which will be used as a basis for determining the rates at which these currencies will be converted into euro on the last day of 1998. On the recommendation of the EMI Council, the EU Finance Ministers recently reached agreement on this latter aspect. A public pre-announcement at the time of the selection of the eligible countries is expected to reduce uncertainty and thus to have a stabilising effect on the exchange rates concerned. As a matter of fact, the public statement that there will be such a pre-announcement at the time of the decision on the list of participating countries already appears to have had the effect of diminishing uncertainty in the markets.  You will recall that the EMI has the statutory obligation to produce, once a year, a report on the state of preparations for Stage Three which includes an assessment of the progress made in terms of convergence in the Community. The EMI has complied with this reporting requirement by releasing - in 1995 as well as in 1996 - a special report in early November. In order not to give confusing signals on the state of convergence in the Community shortly before its assessment - due in March 1998 - of the situation for the year 1997 as a whole, the EMI Council decided against releasing a special report in November of this year. Instead, the 1996 Annual Report, published in April of this year, is considered to have fulfilled the relevant statutory reporting obligation for 1997, as was indicated in the executive summary of the Report.  As regards the 1997 Annual Report, compliance with the normal schedule of publication, as laid down in the EMI\\'s Rules of Procedure, would have meant publication in April 1998, following approval of its content by the EMI Council in early March. The one-month interim period is necessary to allow for its translation into all Community languages. One effect of this production time schedule is that economic information in the Annual Report never fully covers the whole of the previous year. The EMI\\'s Convergence Report, scheduled for publication at the end of March 1998, will of course be based on outcomes for 1997. Again, to avoid sending confusing signals by releasing an Annual Report containing data which is unavoidably not completely up-to-date between the date of publication of its Convergence Report and that of the decision on the list of eligible countries, the EMI Council has agreed unanimously on the need to deviate from the Rules of Procedures. The 1997 Annual Report will therefore be released, and addressed to the European Parliament, in June rather than in April 1998. This timing will, in a way, symbolically close the \"EMI chapter\" vis-à-vis the public.  Next year\\'s Convergence Report will, in conformity with the Treaty requirement under Article 109j, paragraph 1, also deal with the achievement of so-called \"legal convergence\". In this connection, in August 1997 the EMI produced a report on\"the adaptation of national legislation, and in particular the statutes of the national central banks, of the Member States of the European Union with a view to Stage Three\". In this report, which was transmitted to the European Parliament last September, the EMI established a list of features which could serve as guidance for national legislators in their endeavours to bring legislation into line with the requirements of Article 108 of the Treaty. These adaptations aim to eliminate inconsistencies with the Treaty as regards the requirements of central bank independence and to reflect the integration of national central banks into the ESCB. Recently, in particular, considerable attention has been paid in a number of Member States to the need to adapt their national central bank\\'s statutes to this effect and the EMI has been and is being asked for its opinion on the draft legal texts. These legislative changes will have to be finalised by the date of the establishment of the ESCB, although the amendments designed to reflect the operational integration of national central banks into the ESCB will only have to take effect at the end of 1998.  As regards the technical preparations required for the establishment of the ESCB and the conduct of the single monetary policy, conceptual work was completed at the end of 1996 and the implementation phase has started. You will recall that in January of this year the EMI published a report on \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three\" which aimed to provide information to the public on the operational aspects of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy, including strategic considerations and the main features of the instruments, procedures and supporting functions under preparation. Reflecting further progress on the detailed specification of the single monetary policy framework, last month the EMI published a report entitled \"General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\".  Compared with the January \"Framework Report\", the September \"General documentation\" document provides more detail on the full set of monetary policy operations in terms of their technical and operational features. It also provides a more extensive description of all the procedures which the ESCB will apply in the execution of its monetary policy operations and which evidently are of considerable interest to the central banks\\' counterparties for their own preparations for Stage Three.  The \"General documentation\" does not deal with considerations of monetary policy strategy, on which subject the EMI released a special report in February 1997. This report extended the analysis provided in the January \"Framework Report\", explained why two potential strategies - namely monetary targeting and inflation targeting - have remained as candidates, and indicated the preparatory work needed from the EMI to enable the ECB Governing Council to choose a strategy and have it fully operational by 1 January 1999.  The EMI and the national central banks are also continuing their preparatory activities to make the TARGET system operational. TARGET will link national large-value payment systems so that banks can transfer bank reserves across the euro area at same-day value and so that the ESCB will be able to ensure quick and uniform transmission of interest rate signals throughout the area. A \"Second Progress Report on the TARGET Project\" was released by the EMI last month, and provided updated information to market participants, in particular on the progress made in terms of the organisational aspects (e.g. operating time), pricing and the technical implementation of the system. Part of this implementation involves making operational the ECB Payment Mechanism, which will, among other things, enable the ECB to execute, under exceptional circumstances, fine-tuning monetary policy operations and to conduct occasional foreign exchange intervention.  Let me also recall that other large-value payment systems will continue to operate in Stage Three in parallel with TARGET. One of these cross-border systems is the Clearing operated by the ECU Banking Association, or EBA, which will settle, on a net basis, end-of-day balances in central bank money in Stage Three. The EMI has reached an agreement on the method to be used for settlement of the EBA Clearing with the ESCB and has informed the EBA accordingly. The method provides for a single settlement account with the ECB, reflecting considerations of simplicity and safety of the settlement process. But it does not exclude decentralised settlement for clearing banks wishing to settle with their respective national central bank.  Still in the area of settlement, the EMI continues to work on preparations for the cross-border use of eligible debt instruments serving as collateral for ESCB monetary policy operations. In this connection, EMU requirements for EU securities settlement systems have been spelled out and discussions with the industry professionals are ongoing. The aim is to enable eligible assets to be used for operations with the ESCB throughout the euro area.  In many other areas - ranging from statistics via IT systems to accounting matters - highly technical preparatory work continues, about which I will spare you the details. The same holds for the preparation of the euro banknotes. In this connection you may recall that in July the EMI made public the draft euro banknote designs, following the presentation in December of last year of the design sketches.  Work has also been undertaken on the ECB\\'s staffing requirements, taking into account the functions which the ECB will perform and the division of labour - in terms of operational activities - between the national central banks and the ECB, on which full agreement exists within the EMI Council. The EMI is now in the process of preparing for the recruitment of the roughly 500 ECB staff members expected to be in place by the end of next year. This compares with the approximately 350 staff members expected to be employed by the EMI at the end of this year.  The preparations for the changeover to the euro have gained considerable momentum over the past twelve months. The EMI has continued to monitor this activity while being of assistance, if so required, in its areas of competence. In particular, the EMI has provided a forum for the exchange of views among the EU-wide associations of the banking and financial industry, which has contributed, inter alia, to an agreement among the latter on a set of harmonised conventions for the euro-denominated money, bond and foreign exchange markets. A joint statement to this effect, released by the associations, has been explicitly welcomed by the EMI Council. The EMI has also reached an understanding with market practitioners on the role of the ESCB in the computation of an effective overnight rate in euro and in the publication of daily indicative exchange rates for the euro.  As Monetary Union draws nearer, attention has started to focus more and more also on the external aspects of EMU. In this context, the Amsterdam European Council invited the EMI to co-operate with the Council and the Commission in studying effective ways of implementing all the provisions of Article 109 of the Treaty. Given the responsibility of the ESCB for the single monetary policy in the euro area and the consultation requirements of the Treaty, it is important that an exchange of information and views takes place between the ECB and the ECOFIN Council on exchange rate matters. To this end, the EMI considers the Treaty provisions for inter-institutional co-operation and the continuation of the present informal arrangements to be fully adequate.  The EMI Council is of the view that the ECOFIN Council should make use only in exceptional circumstances of the possibility of formulating general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to non-Community currencies which \"shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability\". Questions about the appropriateness and form of such orientations should be settled at a later stage in the light of the conditions prevailing at the time. In any case, it should be emphasised that the Treaty does not allow the ECB to make any commitment other than those indicated in the Treaty.  The EMI Council also considers that it should be possible for the ESCB to be represented by the ECB at the IMF. Further work in this area is planned.  In my brief introductory overview of the EMI\\'s recent activities, I have attempted to illustrate that the institutional, legal and technical preparations for EMU are well under way from the point of view of the central banking community. Of course, much remains to be done and there is no room for complacency. The same holds true, I would say, for the preparatory work of all the other actors involved in this ambitious project of creating Monetary Union in Europe. EU Member States must continue their progress in terms of economic convergence, focusing in particular on the challenges remaining in the areas of fiscal policy and labour markets. As for the EMI, the challenge for the coming six months will be to deliver a thorough assessment of the state of convergence and to bring all the required preparatory work to a stage that will enable the ESCB to have at its disposal a well-tested, fully operational framework for the conduct of the single monetary policy.

      "['1997-09-22', 'Willem F. Duisenberg', 'The European Monetary Institute and progress towards monetary union', 'Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute at the International Banking Seminar in Hong Kong on 22 September 1997', '  The European Monetary Institute and progress towards monetary union   Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute at the International Banking Seminar in Hong Kong on 22 September 1997 The start of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is only around fifteen months away. In March next year the EMI and the European Commission will present their reports on the state of convergence among EU Member States. Without prejudging this final assessment, it may be concluded that important progress has been made over recent years as regards the convergence of inflation and interest rates. In addition to that, generally speaking, exchange rates among EU currencies have been stable. Although efforts still have to be made to ensure the sustainability of sound public finances, the overall movement in this area is also in the right direction.  The commitment to the EMU process was also clear in the announcement made in Luxembourg by the EU Finance Ministers just a week ago that they will pre-announce in May next year the bilateral exchange rates at which the currencies participating in the euro area will be irrevocably fixed, at the same time as the decision on which Member States will adopt the euro. This \"pre-pre-announcement\" was well received by financial markets and had an impact on interest rate differentials and the position of some currencies in the ERM.  Since its establishment in 1994, the main task of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) has been to translate into a coherent plan, and to implement, the political commitment to establish a monetary union that the European countries made in signing the Maastricht Treaty.  There was no historical precedent for achieving such an objective. What monetary theory and practice suggest, however, is that a new currency cannot be introduced only by means of an act of law. In modern economies, the role played by money is the result of the interplay between authorities\\' actions and the behaviour of market participants. Money cannot develop without a market in which supply and demand conditions can be expressed. Without a market for the euro, it will not be possible for it to become the European single currency. Therefore, the move to a single currency requires action by the monetary authorities and by market participants.  The work conducted by the EMI over the past three and a half years has reflected this dual approach, and I should like to discuss it further. I shall first explain how the EMI has organised and conducted its preparatory work for establishing the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). I shall then explain the ways in which the EMI has been operating to ensure that a euro market will also develop from the start of Stage Three of EMU. I shall close with some personal views on the outlook for the euro.  Let me start with the preparation of the ESCB for the conduct of the single monetary policy.  The Maastricht Treaty specifies a clear timetable for the preparatory work to be undertaken by the EMI. Taking 1 January 1999 as the first day of Stage Three and 1 July 1998 as the deadline for the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB), the key decisions to be taken by the EMI concerning the selection and adjustment of the key monetary policy instruments and procedures have been scheduled on the basis of the lead times estimated for the implementation of those decisions. According to this schedule, the EMI devoted its first three years to the definition, assessment and comparison of the various options available. On this basis, at the end of 1996 the EMI Council took the main decisions concerning the principal instruments and the supporting infrastructure that the EMI would have to prepare and make available to the ECB. These choices are described in detail in the EMI document entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: Specification of the operational framework\", published in January 1997.  The second phase of the preparatory work started at the beginning of this year and will go on until mid-1998. It comprises the technical specification of the operational framework and its implementation. Two recent EMI publications (\"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General Documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\" and the \"Second Progress Report on the TARGET Project\") describe the further technical specifications of the ESCB\\'s operational framework. Implementation is under way in most areas, both at the EMI, in preparation for the ECB, and at the national central banks (NCBs).  The third and final phase of the preparatory work will start in mid-1998 with the establishment of the ECB. It will comprise the final choice of certain options that have remained open and the testing of all the technical and operational procedures. The conduct of the testing work will be integrated with a view to ensuring that the ESCB will be in a position to perform its functions in full as of 1 January 1999.  Although I do not wish to describe the preparatory work in greater detail, I should nevertheless like to recall the main principles and the main choices that have been made.  The first main, overriding principle on which preparatory work has been based is that the ECB will conduct the single monetary policy with a view to achieving its primary objective of maintaining price stability. This principle is derived directly from the Treaty. Second, monetary policy instruments have been selected on the basis of their operational efficiency and their conformity with market principles. The third important principle that has guided the preparatory work is that monetary policy will be implemented - \"to the extent deemed possible and appropriate\" - in a decentralised manner, with a view to taking advantage of existing infrastructures at the NCBs.  On the basis of these guiding principles, four main characteristics of the ESCB\\'s operational framework should be underlined.  First, the ESCB will operate in the money market mainly through standard market-oriented operations, such as open market operations. Two standing facilities and the possibility of imposing reserve requirements have also been prepared. Administrative instruments that may create distortions or subsidies for some categories of operators have been discarded.  Second, the monetary policy operations of the ESCB will largely be executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs. It has been agreed that the ECB will be entitled to conduct fine-tuning operations, under exceptional circumstances, and occasional foreign exchange intervention.  Third, in defining eligible assets for monetary policy operations, existing differences in Member States\\' financial structures, which are of particular importance for national financial markets and banking systems, have been taken into account in the preparatory work with a view to ensuring some continuity for market participants in the different countries.  Finally, the monetary policy framework has been designed with a view to ensuring that homogeneous conditions are applied to all counterparties, irrespective of their location in the euro area. For instance, although regular tenders for central bank money will be implemented in a decentralised manner, they will be decided and organised centrally by the ECB, thereby ensuring equal treatment for counterparties.  The EMI has also conducted preparatory work in a range of other areas relevant to monetary policy, such as statistics, accounting and payment systems, with a view to ensuring that the ECB will have all the necessary instruments available to implement the single monetary policy from the start of Stage Three.  I should now like to turn to the issue of how market participants have been preparing for the single currency.  The EMI has taken the view that market participants should determine their own ways and means of adapting to the single currency. On the other hand, a well-functioning and efficient euro financial market is a prerequisite for a credible changeover to the single currency. The EMI has thus encouraged initiatives aimed at fostering the creation of a large, liquid and transparent euro financial market from the start of Stage Three. In particular, the EMI has been prepared to provide guidance or to take action on this matter when asked to do so by market participants.  The EMI has made contributions in four main areas:      the definition of the changeover scenario;   the legal framework for the introduction of the euro;   the payment system infrastructure;   the adoption of market standards.     Let me briefly address each of these issues in turn.  I should like to start with the changeover scenario, which was approved by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995 on the basis of the contribution made by the EMI. Such a scenario was necessary for market participants to co-ordinate their actions with a view to a smooth changeover to the single currency. The adopted scenario lays down the starting dates and deadlines for the main phases of the changeover to the euro, within which market participants are free to make personal adjustments.  There will be sufficient time, around three years after the irrevocable fixing of the conversion rates, to complete the final move to the new currency. Ultimately at that moment banknotes and coins of the former national currencies will be withdrawn from circulation. During this period, market participants will be neither compelled to use nor prohibited from using financial instruments denominated in euro or in national currencies, as those in different currencies will be deemed to be ex lege equivalent.  What is clear is that from January 1999 onwards the single monetary policy will be conducted and implemented in euro; new sovereign debt in all participating Member States will be denominated in the single currency; and most European governments have already announced that they will also redenominate outstanding stocks in the single currency.  The second area in which the EMI has contributed in order to ease the transition to the euro concerns the legal framework, which some market practitioners considered to be essential to avoid confusion and future litigation. On the basis of background work conducted by the EMI and the European Commission, the Council approved a Regulation on 17 June 1997 which reaffirms, inter alia, the principle of the continuity of contracts and gives an assurance to financial markets that \"the introduction of the euro shall not have the effect of altering any term of a legal instrument or of discharging or excusing performance under any legal instrument, nor give a party the right unilaterally to alter or terminate such an instrument\". It is worth recalling that a similar rule came into force in the Illinois and New York State legal systems as of July 1997, thereby ensuring respect of the principle of the continuity of contracts in the Chicago and New York markets.  The third area in which the EMI has supported the process of market integration concerns payment systems. The EMI has developed a new payment infrastructure, known as TARGET, which will enable market participants to effect large-value payments across the EU in real time. TARGET is based on the national real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, which are connected to one another by an Interlinking mechanism. Free, unlimited and collateralised intraday credit will be made available to participants to smooth payment flows. The availability of such a payment system will enable market participants to conduct arbitrage operations and to take advantage of profit opportunities arising from any discrepancies in money market rates in the euro money market both swiftly and at low cost. This will ensure the uniformity of monetary conditions across the euro area. The ECB will have its own payment mechanism being part of TARGET.  Finally, let me turn to the definition of common market standards, which will be essential for the development of a truly EMU-wide market. At present, each national financial market has its own standards concerning day-count interest rates, settlement times, operating days and fixing procedures in particular. For this reason, efforts geared to achieving harmonisation were deemed to be necessary.  In March 1997 the EMI invited EU-wide banking and financial associations to take the lead in defining market conventions for the euro market. In July ten of the major banking and financial associations in the EU, including those active at the world-wide level, published a joint statement on market conventions for the euro, which should be inserted into all terms and conditions of new financial instruments after the start of EMU. The EMI publicly supported and welcomed this agreement, which sets the basis for common European standards.  The work conducted by the EMI in all these areas has supported the preparations made by the banking and financial industry. In most countries, banks have made great progress in their preparatory work, and not only in the wholesale financial area. As a matter of fact, several banks are even preparing to offer their retail customers financial services in both the national currency denomination and in euro as from 1 January 1999.  Very briefly, this is the state of the art in the preparatory work for the single currency, as it appears from both the authorities\\' and the market perspective.  Stage Three of EMU will start in around fifteen months\\' time and the picture is becoming clearer every day. What emerges, and I should like to close with some personal views, is that the interplay between market forces and the authorities\\' actions are helping to create a strong euro financial market. Through the initiative demonstrated by market participants and in co-ordination with the authorities, what is currently being shaped could potentially be the largest financial market in the world if measured according to outstanding stocks of assets. The improvements in terms of the size, liquidity and transparency that this market will experience with the changeover to the euro will create the basis for strong world-wide demand for euro-denominated assets. The pace of developments cannot be forecast, but the direction is clear: the euro will be a major player in the international monetary and financial system.  What role will the ESCB play in this new context?  To some extent the answer is very simple, as it is given in the Treaty. The role of the ESCB will be to implement the single monetary policy with a view to achieving the overriding objective of maintaining price stability.  I do not wish to enter into any of the sterile debates on a weak euro versus a strong euro which are currently taking place in some newspapers and journals. It is important to realise that the preparatory work that has been conducted to date, not only at the EMI, but also within the broader European political forums, will have enabled an ESCB to be established which will be able to operate fully and independently in order to maintain price stability in the euro area.  I say that not only because, as a central banker, I am convinced of the virtues of price stability as a pre-condition for sustainable growth, but also and especially because, as a European, a stable euro will be essential for Monetary Union to create (and I quote) \"an ever closer union among the people of Europe\", which is the ultimate goal of EMU as laid down in the Treaties of Paris (1951) and Rome (1957), and more recently reiterated at Maastricht (1992) and Amsterdam (1997).

Duisenberg,President of the European Monetary Instituteat a luncheon organised in conjunction withthe Luxembourg Bankers' Association and the International Bankers Clubin Luxembourg on 12 September 1997\", '  From the EMI to the ESCB: Achievements and challenges   Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg,President of the European Monetary Instituteat a luncheon organised in conjunction withthe Luxembourg Bankers\\' Association and the International Bankers Clubin Luxembourg on 12 September 1997 It is a great pleasure to be here today to speak to you about the progress that has been made in respect of the transition to Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and some of the challenges that lie ahead.  The European Monetary Institute (EMI), established under the Maastricht Treaty, has been assigned an important role in the transition to Monetary Union. Located in Frankfurt, it came into being on 1 January 1994, its members being the central banks of the EU Member States. The three main tasks of the EMI are to further strengthen co-operation among the national central banks and the co-ordination of national monetary policies with the aim of ensuring price stability; to provide advice to the EU Council regarding the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by Member States adopting the single currency; and to undertake the necessary technical preparations required for EMU. The European Central Bank (ECB) will be established by the appointment of its President and other members of the Executive Board after the decision is taken on which countries will participate initially in Monetary Union, and will, in conjunction with the national central banks (NCBs), form the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which will take on responsibility for monetary policy within the euro area from the beginning of 1999. By then, the EMI will have been liquidated.  In considering the achievements and challenges on the way to Monetary Union I should like to focus my remarks on two issues which are at the forefront of the tasks of the EMI; first, and very briefly, the progress and challenges with respect to convergence. Second, the state of preparations for the introduction of the single currency.   PROGRESS TOWARDS CONVERGENCE  In the area of convergence, a key challenge facing the European Union is the selection of the countries which will be deemed eligible to participate in Monetary Union from 1 January 1999.  As you are no doubt aware, the Treaty provides that no Member State can enter EMU unless the Heads of State or Government conclude that it fulfils the necessary conditions to do so in terms of attaining a high degree of sustainable convergence as indicated by price stability, the sustainability of fiscal positions, exchange rate stability and the convergence of long-term interest rates. In this context, let me say that I do not intend - and I am sure you would not expect me - to discuss the probability of individual Member States participating in EMU from the outset. The EMI will give its views on this subject in due course as, under the Maastricht Treaty, it is required to provide a report on convergence to the EU Council in the spring of next year. I am, however, happy to discuss the current situation in relation to the convergence criteria. In short, there has been a considerable measure of achievement in some areas, notably in the progress towards price stability, while some challenges still remain, particularly in the fiscal area.  With regard to inflation, Member States have made remarkable progress in recent years. As measured by both the national Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) and the recently introduced Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the weighted average annual rate of inflation in the EU currently stands at 1.7%. Not only has such a subdued rate of price increases not been achieved for decades, but there are also few signs of incipient price pressures. Furthermore, differences in inflation rates among Member States have declined substantially: almost all Member States currently have HICP inflation rates of around 2% or less.  Reflecting the pattern of economic convergence in actual and expected inflation, and credible monetary policies, intra-EU exchange rate stability has been broadly maintained during the first half of 1997, while long-term interest rates are low and long-term interest rate differentials have narrowed.  The fiscal situation is less bright. Most countries exceeded the reference values of the Treaty in 1996 and had yet to ensure sustainable consolidation. In May, the ECOFIN Council sent recommendations to correct excessive deficits to all Member States with the exception of Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland. This points to the crucial need to ensure sustainable convergence in the fiscal field. Notably, it is quite evident that sustainable consolidation cannot be achieved by one-off and accounting measures. Looking ahead to the medium term, it is necessary to address the issue of the future liabilities of social security systems in the context of an ageing population. In the absence of appropriate reforms, sizable increases in contributions, or even substantial increases in government indebtedness, would appear to be in prospect. This is of particular importance as fiscal discipline is essential not only at the time of entering EMU but also thereafter.  I would acknowledge that the fiscal stance has generally been tightened. The government deficit for the EU as a whole is forecast, according to the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD, to decline from 4.4% of GDP in 1996 to around 2.9-3.0% in 1997. For the EU as a whole, the debt ratio was estimated to have risen further in 1996, to 73.2%, but is generally projected to fall slightly in 1997. Needless to say, the projections have yet to be confirmed by outcomes.  Besides fulfilment of the convergence criteria, there are also a number of other significant challenges in the economic environment; in particular, there is a clear and insistent need for structural adjustment, notably in labour markets. The Union does not have a good record in terms of job creation. Unemployment in most Member States, though showing signs of stabilising, remains high, and the situation in labour markets is forecast to remain highly unsatisfactory. A wide range of institutional rigidities account for the weak employment performance, and it will be a major challenge to tackle them in a decisive manner. Of course, continued cost moderation is also required. I welcome the importance that has been attached to the issue of labour markets by the Council, in particular the Resolution on growth and employment passed at Amsterdam in June this year and the initiative for an extraordinary meeting of the European Council this autumn under the Luxembourg Presidency.   PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE SINGLE MONETARY POLICY   From the issue of economic convergence, let me now turn to the technical preparations for the conduct of a single monetary policy. The EMI is responsible for preparing the operational framework that will enable the ESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three: preparatory work that is progressing according to schedule. The conceptual phase has been completed for all the main issues of relevance and the main challenge now is for the EMI (working closely with the NCBs) to ensure that the options which have been selected are designed in full detail, and that they are prepared and tested in due time. The framework, as prepared by the EMI, will be submitted to the ECB for decision after its establishment in 1998.  Let me mention a number of the areas where the EMI is involved in preparations. I shall try, in particular, to provide you with a guide to the progress that has been made more recently. The EMI continues to focus on a wide range of issues, such as monetary policy strategies, the instruments and procedures necessary for conducting a single monetary policy, foreign exchange issues, the integration of national payment systems through TARGET, the issuance of euro banknotes, statistical issues relating to the conduct of a common monetary policy, the rules for operations of NCBs within the framework of the ESCB, and the structure and functions of the ECB/ESCB.  First, let me remind you that the EMI published an assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies in February this year. The Treaty provides unambiguous guidance as to the ultimate objective: \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". However, in pursuing this objective, the ESCB, like all central banks, will face a complex transmission process from policy actions to price developments with long and variable lags. Thus, policy decisions directed at price stability must be both pre-emptive and forward-looking, taking into account all relevant information regarding the prospective evolution of prices, and taking appropriate and timely action to ensure that the final objective is achieved. In addition, the need for credibility and consistency of the decision-making process over time will require the ESCB to establish a clear framework to guide the use of its monetary policy instruments with a view to achieving its final objective.  The document to which I am referring (\"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: elements of the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB\") identified two potential candidate strategies, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. Overall, it concluded that the similarities in the behaviour of those central banks that pursue these two strategies are greater than the differences. Regardless of their choice of strategy, they all monitor a wide and similar set of economic and financial variables as indicators in determining the monetary policy stance.  The ESCB will face two particular challenges from the outset when implementing a monetary policy strategy for Stage Three. First, the ESCB will have no track record of its own and must, therefore, attach the utmost importance to establishing and maintaining a high degree of credibility. Second, the transition to Stage Three will constitute a major shift in regime, which will imply initial uncertainty concerning economic and financial conditions and developments in the euro area as well as the future relationships between major macroeconomic variables. It will not be easy for the Governing Council of the ECB to draw firm conclusions from the observation of indicators.  Moreover, while the stance of the single monetary policy of the ESCB can only be set to ensure that it will be appropriate for the euro area as a whole, it will nevertheless be important for the ESCB to be fully aware of any differential impact of its policies across Member States due to remaining structural differences across countries, not least because inflation in an individual Member State may spill over into the euro area as a whole.  In order to implement its monetary policy strategy, the ESCB will need to rely on a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures - its operational framework. The EMI Council has defined a set of monetary policy instruments that will be made available to the ESCB. In January of this year the EMI published a report entitled \"The single monetary policy in Stage Three: specification of the operational framework\". The aim of the report was to provide information to the public on the operational aspects of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy, including the main features of the instruments, procedures and supporting functions which were being prepared by the EMI.  Briefly, it is envisaged that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations, in most cases employing reverse transactions, but that it will also offer two standing facilities (a marginal lending facility and a deposit facility), and a broad range of counterparties will have access to ESCB operations. Preparations have also been made for an infrastructure that will allow the ESCB, if it so chooses, to impose minimum reserve requirements. The ECB will decide in 1998 whether to do so. Required reserves could be used mainly to stabilise money market interest rates and to create or enlarge a structural liquidity shortage. The EMI has seen a need to study further the extension of the relevant article of the ESCB/ECB Statute to allow the ECB to subject a broader range of financial institutions than credit institutions alone to reserve requirements.  The EMI plans to publish a further report in the near future on the subject of monetary policy instruments and procedures, the so-called \"General documentation\", which updates the operational framework, taking account of the progress made in the specification of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy instruments and procedures over the past few months. This new report is intended particularly to provide financial institutions with the information they need to prepare themselves to participate in ESCB monetary policy operations in Stage Three. In this respect, the report sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by financial institutions to be eligible counterparties in ESCB monetary policy operations. It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB (the main refinancing operations, the longer-term refinancing operations, fine-tuning operations and structural operations) and those of the ESCB\\'s two standing facilities. The report will contain a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations and, furthermore, it will specify the eligibility criteria and risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB\\'s liquidity-providing operations. It will also present the features of the ESCB\\'s minimum reserves system as prepared by the EMI. Of course, the final decision on the operational framework will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB after its establishment. The Governing Council, consisting of the Executive Board of the ECB together with the Governors of each of the participating Member States\\' central banks, may choose not to use all the options made available in the General documentation, or may decide to amend certain features.  Next week the EMI also plans to publish a provisional list of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs), primarily for the use of reporting institutions and compilers of statistics, in support of its aim to produce a homogeneous monetary sector and reporting population for the production of properly articulated money and banking statistics in Stage Three. This report will cover credit institutions but not Money Market Funds (MMFs). Work is under way to identify Money Market Funds in the EU for inclusion in an Addendum to the present provisional list, which it is planned to make available later in the year.  Another important aspect of the EMI\\'s work relates to legal convergence, i.e. the adaptation of national legislation including the statutes of the NCBs, with a view to Stage Three. Member States are obliged, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, to eliminate incompatibilities between national legislation and the Treaty and ESCB/ECB Statute. The EMI has considered this earlier in both its 1995 and 1996 Annual Reports, distinguishing between central bank independence, the integration of NCBs in the ESCB and legislation other than the statutes of the NCBs. Recent work has built on these earlier reports.  Given that not all Member States are likely to participate from the start of Stage Three, the exchange rate relationship between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries will be of great importance. The EMI has finalised the first stage of its preparatory work on the future monetary and exchange rate relationships between the euro area and other EU countries. The outline of a new mechanism (ERM II) was approved in Amsterdam in June of this year and includes the following features: it will be based on central rates, defined vis-à-vis the euro for non-euro area currencies. A standard fluctuation band will be established for these currencies around their central rates. The margins of the standard fluctuation band will be relatively wide: +/- 15%. Central rates and the standard wide band will be set by mutual agreement between the ECB, the Ministers of the euro area Member States and Ministers and Governors of the central banks of the non-euro area Member States. The ECB will have the right to initiate a realignment and the possibility of suspending intervention and financing if these were to threaten the pursuit of price stability. The ERM II does not rule out forms of closer exchange rate co-operation between non-euro area NCBs and the ECB agreed on a case-by-case basis, such as narrower fluctuation bands.  The integration of payment systems is an essential element of the technical preparations for Stage Three, in order to facilitate the implementation of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy, and to provide sound and efficient mechanisms to settle same-day cross-border payments under any circumstances. In March 1995 the EMI Council agreed to establish the TARGET system; the TARGET Report was released in May 1995 and a first progress report in August 1996, providing additional information. Further work in this field has focused on elaborating the organisational aspects of TARGET, the technical implementation of the system and legal issues. For instance, in February this year the EMI Council endorsed the decision to choose S.W.I.F.T. as the Interlinking network provider and a contract was finalised in June. Testing of NCB links with the EMI\\'s test centre has begun. An ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) is also being prepared. It has been decided that the ECB will have a direct link to the Interlinking, in the same way as the NCBs. The EMI will be publishing a second progress report shortly, covering detailed issues such as the harmonisation of the operating time of domestic RTGS systems linked to TARGET, pricing policy and the provision of intraday liquidity to non-euro area NCBs. It is proposed that there should only be two common days when TARGET is closed: Christmas Day and New Year\\'s Day. On other days the TARGET system will remain open, but individual NCBs will have the flexibility to close on national or regional holidays. The Interlinking system will remain open as long as at least two national RTGS systems are open. Normal TARGET operating hours will be from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. \"ECB time\" (that is, the time on the clocks at the ECB), although some flexibility could be left to NCBs to open earlier for domestic reasons. On the issue of pricing, it has been agreed by the EMI Council that a common transaction fee for cross-border TARGET transfers should be charged, based on the principle of full cost recovery (subject to confirmation from the Commission that this would not create competitive distortions). The EMI is intending to publish a price range, but the exact fees will be decided by the Governing Council of the ECB. There has also been progress with respect to options for preventing intraday credit, if provided to non-euro area NCBs, from spilling over into overnight credit. One of the options is for an earlier cut-off time for these NCBs connected to TARGET. It has been decided that if this option were to be chosen, the earlier closing time would only need to apply to the use of intraday credit in euro (which means in effect a liquidity deadline), rather than to the processing of payments.  During the first half of this year, the EMI opened a dialogue with EU-wide banking and financial associations on issues concerning their preparation for the changeover to the euro. In March, the EMI and the representatives of the banking community agreed a list of priorities for preparatory work to be accomplished during the year. At the request of the banking industry, the EMI supported the private sector\\'s preparations by defining common standards for the computation of interest rates in the money market, the method of quotation of the exchange rate of the foreign currencies against the euro and the definition of euro area-wide business days. The EMI invited the banking and financial community to take a lead in harmonizing other market conventions.  This lead ten EU-wide banking associations and two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs) to submit to the EMI a \"joint statement on market conventions for the euro\". This statement is a non-binding catalogue of market standards which are proposed by the signatory associations to issuers of financial instruments and other market participants for inclusion in new wholesale financial products after the start of EMU. The statement proposes that, after the start of Stage Three, newly issued instruments in the euro financial markets should reflect minimum standards of harmonisation. The EMI has welcomed and supported the initiative taken by the associations of the banking and financial industry, which reflects a broad consensus among market participants on common conventions for the euro financial markets, and is of the view that implementation of these conventions will enhance the integration of, and greater transparency in, the euro financial markets.  In discussions with the EMI, representatives of some EU-wide banking associations have also stressed that they would favour the ESCB participating in a neutral manner in the calculation of an overnight reference rate to be used in the context of derivatives contracts for the euro area. Originally, the EMI Council was of the opinion that it should not interfere in what is essentially a matter for the private sector. However, the market has indicated to the EMI its difficulties in calculating this reference rate itself and, given the need to ensure the continuity of contracts, the Council has reconsidered and has agreed to assist in the calculation of this rate, although it will not take responsibility for its publication.  Finally, let me come to the topic of the ESCB itself. The main issues outstanding as regards the degree of centralisation and decentralisation of operations within the ESCB have now been agreed upon. One significant challenge confronting the EMI and the NCBs in the coming months will be to determine the functions and the structure of the ECB. Significant thought has been given to these issues within the EMI, and the EMI Council has given serious consideration to staffing requirements. I regard it likely that just under 500 staff members will be required initially; the current staff at the EMI numbers less than 350. Given the lead times needed to recruit suitably qualified staff, this process will begin in the near future. Further consideration is being given to institutional issues, in particular the form of co-operation between the ECB and the NCBs. Although there are some specific responsibilities assigned to the different bodies within the ESCB, there will also need to be close co-operation between them. The experience to date with sub-committees and working groups of central bank experts meeting under the auspices of the EMI suggests that this could form a useful basis for such co-operation in Stage Three.   CONCLUSION  To conclude, EU Member States have made considerable progress in terms of economic convergence, although challenges remain in terms of structural reforms, notably in the area of fiscal policy and labour and product markets. Considerable progress has also been made by the EMI in terms of the necessary preparations for the introduction of the single currency on schedule on 1 January 1999. The greatest challenge that lies ahead is to establish and maintain a zone of price stability within the euro area after the start of Stage Three, in fulfilment of the clear mandate given to the ECB in the Maastricht Treaty. Personally, I am convinced that the application of the convergence criteria, the institutional arrangements for the ESCB and the preparations that have been made to date will ensure that the euro will be a stable currency and that the ESCB will be a powerful institution, safeguarding the value of the new currency./.

      "['1997-06-30', 'Alexandre Lamfalussy', 'Farewell address', 'Address given by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy on the occasion of the change of presidency of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt am Main on 30 June 1997', '  Farewell address   Address given by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy on the occasion of the change of presidency of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt am Main on 30 June 1997 The moment has come for me to say a heartfelt \"thank you\" to you all!  I should like to express my gratitude, first of all, to the governors of the central banks of the European Union, who, in the autumn of 1993, chose me as their candidate for the presidency of the European Monetary Institute, thereby setting in train a process which has allowed me to play a part in a ground-breaking enterprise of exceptional scope and responsibility. I should like to thank them, secondly, in their capacity as members of the EMI Council, for their co-operation in this undertaking and for their wisdom, prudence, willingness to compromise but also their will to achieve results. They have invariably acted with the utmost professionalism. I should like to add that we should not have been able to achieve what has been done without the conviction - which each of us shares - that the first duty of a central bank is to maintain price stability. This fundamental principle has never been a matter of dispute.  My thanks go next to the political authorities. First, to the Heads of State or of Government, who did me the honour of putting their faith in me in appointing me President of the EMI. Second, to the Finance Ministers, who resigned themselves gracefully to the existence of an institution which would be independent of the executive and who played their part, with consummate political skill, in establishing the good working atmosphere between the ECOFIN and the EMI, in the mutual respect of our respective competences. I hope that this will be an enduring legacy.  Thanks go, too, to the European Commission, with which we have been able - after a little trial and error, and with both sides demonstrating good will and a certain ability to listen - to draw up the rules of the game for the indispensable co-operation which is needed to enable the project of Economic and Monetary Union to go ahead.  The European Parliament - and several national parliaments - have given me the opportunity to report on the work of the EMI, in an atmosphere of constructive dialogue. Their questions and concerns, as well as those of the media and of the large number of associations from both the banking and financial sphere as well as society at large, have given me valuable insights into the expectations and concerns of our fellow citizens.  These thanks would not be complete without my expressing publicly what I have already had the opportunity to say in private to the members of the management and staff of the European Monetary Institute: without their personal commitment, their spirit of innovation, their boundless ability to find the happy medium - and not just a practical compromise between the concerns of our central banks - nothing would have been accomplished.  What can I say to you now by way of farewell? There is little point in giving you the \"final score\" at this stage - the match is not over yet... Recommendations on how to cope with the challenges which are looming on the horizon? You will deal with them effectively, I am convinced, without my advice. But perhaps you will accept some reflections on the ability - and the limits - of monetary policy to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens who, while appreciating the confirmation (or renewal) of price stability, are looking for stronger growth and, above all, more jobs. I share their concern unreservedly. The current level of unemployment in the majority of our countries is ethically unacceptable; it is leading to the erosion of the social fabric and, because of the waste it represents, it is a clear signal that the economy is not functioning properly. Reducing unemployment must be the prime objective of action by the authorities. But what should be the role of monetary policy? In view of the short time available to me - plus the fact that you cannot contradict me - I shall be brief. You may perhaps feel that I am being dogmatic: if so, please bear with me. I should like to make four observations.  1. There is no doubt whatsoever that monetary policy can bring inflation under control. When monetary policy is not flanked by the appropriate budgetary policy, and when labour markets - but also goods and services markets - are not flexible, bringing inflation under control will take time. It will take time, and it can also entail costs - which could otherwise have been avoided. But even so, these costs would still be less than the (very high long-term) cost of not dealing with inflation. Let us not forget that while the rich and the powerful can protect themselves from any loss of purchasing power of their money - and in many cases can even benefit from such a loss - the weak and the not-so-rich will always be the losers. Inflation has always been a major source of social iniquity. In addition, it prevents the economy from functioning properly, by falsifying the signals which are given by prices. The speculative boom in the real estate markets in some of our countries at the end of the 1980s caused serious damage - and we are still paying the price.  2. Once inflation has been brought under control, and once this control has been confirmed, monetary policy can guide short-term interest rates to a level which contributes to balanced growth. Quite a number of EU countries are in such a situation already, with short-term interest rates at around 3%. In others, where inflation has been brought under control more recently, rates have not yet reached this level but are approaching it gradually. The confirmation that inflation has been brought under control does, unfortunately, take time. Finally, in one major country which has seen rapid growth for several years now and in which unemployment has fallen remarkably, short-term interest rates have been raised - applying the principle of preventive medicine.  3. Now, what can we say about long-term interest rates, which also have an important role to play in stimulating growth - perhaps an even more important one than short-term rates?  Monetary policy does have an influence on the level of these rates, but its influence is not exclusive and we cannot even predict the direction of its influence with certainty. At this particular point in time, in the first group of countries to which I referred a moment ago, nominal long-term interest rates are at a historically low level - they are well below 6% - but real long-term interest rates can be regarded, perhaps, as still being too high to put continental Europe on the road to more vigorous growth.  I am doubtful whether a further easing of monetary policy in this group of countries would be able to help move the yield curve in the desired direction. It could actually have the opposite effect - if investors perceived it as heralding a weak euro. In any event, given the current level of short-term interest rates, monetary policy\\'s margin for manoeuvre is extremely limited.  It is possible that the level of real long-term interest rates in Europe reflects, partially at least, that of real interest rates world-wide. Europe has no influence over that effect.  Europe can, however, have an influence on the effect which comes from the constant increase in public sector indebtedness in our countries. As a reminder, between the end of 1991 and the end of 1996 the general government debt rose from around 56 to above 73% of GDP for the European Union as a whole. This development, together with the worry that it might not yet have run its course, are not likely - to say the least - to lead to a fall in real interest rates. Nor do they create the climate of confidence necessary for consumers and investors to modify their current prudent behaviour. On the other hand, the certainty that governments are tackling the underlying causes of the public deficits which are responsible for the constant increase in the debt burden could well bring about such a change in behaviour. \"Faceless\" markets are not the only ones looking beyond the immediate present to the future - our fellow citizens are, too. The prospect of self-perpetuating, ever-increasing deficits will not encourage them to spend more.  4. Stronger growth would certainly have a beneficial effect on employment. But it would not eliminate the largest component of unemployment - the structural component. This can only be done by means of measures which remedy labour market rigidities and reduce the burden of non-wage labour costs. It is this latter channel that links efforts to create jobs with the task of bringing public expenditure under control. I observe, too, that in those countries where unemployment has fallen substantially, jobs have been created not by existing enterprises - and especially not by large enterprises - but by the setting-up of a large number of new enterprises, which have necessarily been small to begin with.  To conclude - allow me, if you will, to be quite blunt. Yes, once inflation has been brought properly under control, monetary policy can and must contribute to supporting balanced growth, but balanced growth will not depend on monetary policy alone. Both the acceleration and the viability of growth will rely on the contribution to be made by other policies. First, on that of a fiscal policy which does not crowd out private investment but, rather, fosters a climate of confidence by implementing a credible process of reforms. Second, on that of a policy which creates a favourable fiscal, financial and regulatory environment for the proliferation of new enterprises. And, so that the growth fostered in this way can create many jobs, structural policies will have to assume the principal role, while the role of monetary policy will then dwindle and fade away - alas - to nothing.

Lamfalussy's farewell as President of the European Monetary Institute, 30 June 1997.\", '  Farewell to a Central banker   Address by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, on the occasion of Baron A. Lamfalussy\\'s farewell as President of the European Monetary Institute, 30 June 1997. Dear Alexandre,  1. Three and a half years ago, when you exchanged the premises of the Bank for International Settlements, an established international financial institution, for a couple of floors in a Frankfurter \"Hochhaus\", you took on a huge task. Your first mission was to set up the European Monetary Institute (EMI), more or less starting from scratch. Moreover, you were faced with the responsibility of managing the preparations for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It was not an easy decision to embark on a grand project like EMU, but putting the flesh on the bones of monetary union is even more difficult. To be honest, at that time I would not like to have been in your shoes.  2. On both accounts you did a great job. The EMI is currently a thriving organisation. The Institute started off with a handful of staff, more or less taken over from the Secretariat of the Committee of EC Central Bank Governors. At present the EMI employs more than 200 people. Before the EMI was established, you had to take seemingly trivial decisions, like choosing suitable furniture for the meeting room of the EMI Council. At an exhibition of furniture on the 36th floor, you immediately picked the smallest chair available, I was told. Indeed, your modesty graces you, but looking at my size, and I\\'m sure I also speak on behalf of some other colleagues, I\\'m glad you eventually picked a larger one.  3. With respect to the preparations for EMU, both the EMI as well as the central banks are on track. Indeed, as far as we are all concerned, EMU can start on 1 January 1999. Hence, you also made things easier for me. You have played the ball from the tee to the green, thus leaving me the \"easy\" task of putting it in.  4. Alexandre, I don\\'t think we are able to play a birdie or an eagle, let alone a hole-in-one. But I promise you, we will play on par. And I can tell you, I\\'ve done worse. Things have not always been easy for you when chairing the meetings of the EMI Council. But being a central banker, heart and soul, you have always managed to find compromises. I vividly remember a few meetings of the EMI Council which you eventually managed to conclude successfully, although they started off as a babel of tongues. Also when ever the atmosphere around the table started to become a bit tense, you always emphasised the need for co-operation and co-ordination. Indeed, in your opening statement to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the European Monetary Institute in November 1993, shortly before you officially took office as the first President of the EMI, you stressed the importance of enhanced monetary policy co-ordination among Member States as a means of steering as smoothly as possible towards Stage Three of EMU. You also stated that the EMI can and should play a constructive role in promoting this process of policy co-ordination.  5. With the benefit of hindsight, everybody will agree that the EMI, under your management, has indeed contributed to a co-operative spirit among the EU national central banks. Indeed, as commentators often focus on the convergence of fiscal policies, which still leaves something to be desired, it is sometimes forgotten that the monetary conditions for the start of a monetary union between the Member States have never been so favourable. In your foreword to the 1996 Annual Report of the EMI you rightly observe that EU foreign exchange markets are moderately calm and long-term interest rates are low, while differentials have narrowed appreciably. But Lamfalussy would not be Lamfalussy if he did not immediately add some reservations. The risks and challenges should not be underestimated, although you see grounds for cautious optimism. Indeed, you would not be a central banker without writing that counter-inflationary vigilance remains essential, although monetary policy has - in your eyes - justifiably been eased against the overall background of subdued inflationary pressures.  6. One of your greatest assets is that you have managed to combine this typical conservative and cautious nature of a central banker, always focused on substance, with your firm belief in European monetary integration. Having been a member of the Delors Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, you were at the cradle of European monetary union. You have never believed that a true single market is in the long run compatible with a quasi-floating exchange rate system. Over the past three and a half years, you have acted as a devoted missionary of EMU and European integration in general. In this capacity, you have managed to convert at least some incredulous European central bankers. And like any good missionary, you have also spread the message of EMU to the outside world. Over the last few years, you have held 67 official speeches and appeared in public on many other occasions, in total approximately 175 times. Indeed, you have beaten me there. A few days ago, when I took leave of the staff of De Nederlandsche Bank, I was reminded of having \"only\" held some 155 official speeches during my presidency of more than 15 years.  7. Dear Alexandre, good wine needs no bush, as we say in the Netherlands. But some wines have such a delicious and well-balanced taste that they cannot remain unnoticed. The \"Chateau Lamfalussy\", mis en bouteille in 1929, is one of them. I am very grateful to you for leaving me a smoothly functioning and high quality institution, which the EMI currently is. And I wish you and your wife all the best.   ']\n",
      "['1997-06-02', 'Alexandre Lamfalussy', 'The changeover to the euro', 'Remarks by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the International Monetary Conference, Interlaken, 2 June 1997', '  The changeover to the euro   Remarks by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the International Monetary Conference, Interlaken, 2 June 1997 Prompted by the evident commitment of the political authorities to the EMU project, the successful convergence of countries\\' performances in some key areas and genuine efforts to reduce fiscal imbalances, financial market indicators in particular suggest a great deal of optimism that Monetary Union will indeed come about, and will commence on time - on 1 January 1999. But it is not only financial markets that are showing such confidence. Banks and companies have also begun to make the investments in information technology that will be required to handle the future single currency. My theme today is the changeover to the euro, with a particular focus on money and capital markets.    The changeover scenario: a reminder   In the spring of next year, the Heads of State or of Government will make the initial choice of the countries that will participate in Monetary Union. They will also establish the European Central Bank (ECB). On 1 January 1999, the exchange rates between the currencies of the participating countries will be replaced by irrevocably locked conversion rates and Monetary Union will become a reality.  On 4 January 1999, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will conduct its first repo. Repos will be the main instrument of the single monetary policy. They are flexible and market-oriented and, therefore, best suited to performing the functions of steering interest rates in the money market and of signalling the ECB\\'s policy intentions. Following the adoption of the scenario for the changeover to the single currency in Madrid in December 1995, repos will be conducted in euro as from 4 January 1999. Two standing facilities will be made available to the counterparties of the ESCB: a marginal lending facility at rates normally above market rates and a deposit facility at rates normally below market rates. The interest rates applied on these two facilities will form a corridor within which will lie the repo rate and within which money market rates will move. Like the repo transactions, operations under the two standing facilities will be conducted in euro as from 4 January 1999. It is not yet clear whether the conditions that the ECB will face at the beginning of 1999 will warrant the use of reserve requirements as a complementary instrument of the single monetary policy and what the precise features of this instrument should be.  An essential feature of the operational framework for the single monetary policy is that it will operate in euro from the beginning, as agreed by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995. The European Council also decided in Madrid that governments will issue all new tradable public debt in euro as from the beginning of Monetary Union.  The starting date of Monetary Union will not bring about a full introduction of the euro immediately. The timing of the physical introduction of the European banknotes and coins and of the changeover of the current operations of public administrations will depend on what is technically possible. In Madrid, the European Council agreed that the European banknotes and coins will be introduced at the latest three years after the start of Monetary Union. Agreement was also reached that the spread of the use of the euro in the current operations of public administrations (for example, payment of civil servants\\' salaries and social security transfers, and collection of taxes) will take place in all participating countries at roughly the moment when the European banknotes and coins are introduced. This chronological framework was adopted in order to promote the transparency and simplicity of the process of changing over to the single currency and its acceptance by the public.  A key feature of the changeover scenario is that, during the period between 1 January 1999 and the moment of the introduction of the European banknotes, the authorities will not intervene, via regulatory channels, to influence the speed at which the euro is introduced in banking activity and among non-bank users of money. This will be neither desirable nor possible. During that period, economic agents will be free to develop their own mechanisms to adapt to the introduction of the euro. They will be able to use the euro, but they will not be obliged to do so (the \"no prohibition, no compulsion\" principle).  At the latest six months after the introduction of the European banknotes, the changeover to the single currency will have been completed for all operations and all agents.    Impact on money markets   There is little doubt, in my opinion, that a Monetary Union-wide money market in euro will develop very quickly.  First, the integration of the national payment systems, through TARGET, will allow banks in the euro area to deal directly with each other for supplying and accessing overnight funds in euro, irrespective of their location. The implementation of TARGET, which will be operational from the first day of Monetary Union, will quickly lead to the creation of a euro area-wide interbank market in which differences in \"local\" interest rates would only reflect differences in credit risk and/or differences in taxation and regulation. It is a possible next step for a private repo market to develop within the euro area, with instruments ranging from overnight to longer-term contracts. The fact that repos will be the main instrument of the single monetary policy will provide a strong incentive for the development of a Monetary Union-wide interbank market for repos and, maybe, at a later stage, for a private repo market, where financial and non-financial entities may engage in short-term collateralised refinancing operations for conducting day-to-day treasury management.  Second, an important consideration in our preparations for the instruments and procedures of the single monetary policy is to facilitate the development of an integrated euro money market. As I said, the single monetary policy will be conducted in euro from the beginning. Moreover, the interest rate corridor (set by the interest rates applied on the two standing facilities) is likely to be relatively wide. The larger the corridor, the more volatility is allowed and the more initiative is left to banks to manage their interest rate exposure. Compared with alternative ways of controlling volatility in the interbank market, the framework for the ECB\\'s monetary policy assigns a central role to the market and does not require the central bank to intervene frequently in the market. This reflects a desire to gear the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy to the market and to use the interbank market as the principal means of allocating liquidity.  Third, the collateral policy of the ECB will be relatively liberal. Unlike most central banks (including the Federal Reserve), it is envisaged that the ECB will accept a wide variety of instruments that range from public to private paper. This has to be seen in the context of a desire to encourage the use of private paper and in relation to the prohibition on preferential treatment of public entities. At the same time, the proposed arrangement for the cross-border use of collateral will allow banks in the euro area to obtain liquidity from their home central bank against assets held anywhere in the area, with TARGET allowing them to transfer the liquidity to any place they wish. Banks will no longer need to hold securities traded at the national level to cover their liquidity needs.  Finally, the European Monetary Institute and, later, the ECB will provide assistance to market participants in the establishment of standards for market practices in the euro area-wide money market. Our recent publication on the operational framework for the single monetary policy has already provided interested market operators with elements of information that are naturally becoming a focal point for the adaptation of national standards or for the elaboration of new joint standards at the European level.    Impact on capital markets   The issuance of new tradable public debt in euro as from the start of Monetary Union will provide an incentive for securities markets to change over to the single currency at an early stage. However, the speed at which the euro will spread in securities markets will also depend on the speed at which public and private debt issued before 1 January 1999 will be redenominated in euro. The choices of public and private borrowers and the preferences of the banking and finance industry at large as regards the timing and modalities of redenomination will have a direct impact on the development of the euro-denominated segment of capital markets at the start of Monetary Union. Let me say a few words on this.  First, the legal framework will have to clearly establish that, for non-sovereign debt, redenomination will require the consent of investors whenever it goes so far as to modify the par value of the security and to affect the legal interest of investors. This is necessary to avoid any disturbances in financial markets. The legal framework is expected to be finalised before the meeting of the EU Council in Amsterdam.  Second, I see the enhancement of the liquidity and depth of capital markets as an important argument for bringing forward the redenomination of financial instruments. Financial market participants would not consider as full substitutes instruments denominated in euro and instruments denominated in the old national currencies, even where they were issued by the same entity. There is a risk that, until the end of the transition period, markets for the old national currency bonds will be de facto split from those for euro bonds and the liquidity of the one or the other segment will tend to fall. Non-redenominated securities would look like \"orphan bonds\" which would attract only local trading.  Public borrowers will also have an interest in promoting the liquidity of their debt during the transition period, so as to benefit from the lowest possible cost of funds. A number of governments within the EU have already announced plans for the redenomination of all or part of their outstanding debt in euro at the start of Stage Three, or shortly thereafter. Such announcements are driven by competitive considerations and, above all, the search for liquidity in the new euro markets.  Third, the currently envisaged modalities and techniques for redenomination are numerous. I am confident, however, that there will be a natural process of technical convergence towards similar approaches within the euro area. In my view, it is desirable that such a process be achieved via the identification by the market of the best practices of sovereign borrowers, rather than by imposing common minimum requirements.  The spread of the use of the single currency in financial markets will contribute to further enhancing capital market integration in the euro area. In such an environment, credit risk is likely to become the most important component of securities pricing in the area. Increased attention, however, will also be paid to other elements of risk: bonds denominated in the same currency and with identical credit risks may still be priced differently if issuing techniques, clearing and securities settlement procedures and legal procedures differ across countries. More uniform pricing of financial assets in euro will also depend on greater uniformity and transparency in issuing techniques and financial infrastructures.    Conclusion   Following the political agreement in Madrid that the single monetary policy of the ECB will be conducted in euro and governments will issue their new debt in euro immediately from the start of Monetary Union, one should expect that money and capital markets will largely and quickly switch over to the single currency. The announcement by a growing number of EU governments that they will redenominate their outstanding debt in euro at the start of Monetary Union, or shortly thereafter, will provide a further incentive for financial markets to quickly adopt the single currency.  Meanwhile, most private individuals and most enterprises are likely to continue to operate in the old national currencies until the time when European banknotes are introduced and public administrations adopt the euro for their current transactions. One should, however, not exclude that large companies will wish to operate and open accounts in euro at an earlier stage. The challenge for banks individually will be to have completed - on time - their own technical preparations, in particular in the field of information systems, to be able to respond with flexibility to the wish of their customers to operate in euro and/or to keep their accounts in national currencies. Quite a challenge.   ']\n",
      "['1997-05-13', 'Alexandre Lamfalussy', 'The European Central Bank: independent and accountable', 'Keynote speech delivered by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Vienna, 13 May 1997', '  The European Central Bank: independent and accountable   Keynote speech delivered by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Vienna, 13 May 1997 Against a background of both historical experience and the evolution of the policy debate, central bank independence has in many countries become the preferred means of providing an institutional framework for monetary policy. Reflecting this growing consensus, the Maastricht Treaty enshrines the independent status of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the EU national central banks - which together form the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) - as a bulwark for ensuring that the future euro area benefits from price stability. However, it must be conceded that despite the fact that the legal arrangements which have been made in this regard for the ESCB are clearly spelled out in the Maastricht Treaty, clarity does not always prevail concerning the scope of such independence. It is against this background that I welcome this opportunity to clarify the basic issues of central bank independence, both as I see them and as they are incorporated in the Treaty.  I would like to organise my speech in two parts. First, I shall take a backward-looking perspective by briefly describing the main arguments underlying the general move towards the establishment of independent central banks with a mandate for price stability. Since I assume that you are quite familiar with the arguments, I will not go into much detail. Second, I shall take a closer look at the Treaty arrangements relating to the independence and accountability of the future ECB. This includes the preparations which are currently under way to ensure that national central banks of Member States comply with the relevant Treaty obligations.   1. The move towards central bank independence  Over the past decades, two significant changes have taken place in the approach to monetary policy-making, with important consequences for the way the institutional arrangements for the future ESCB were designed. One relates to the adoption of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy, and the other to the mandate widely given to central banks to pursue this objective independent of political interference.  The first element of this sea-change was probably triggered by the negative experience of the 1970s, when inflation and unemployment rose in parallel, despite the efforts of macroeconomic policy-makers to generate renewed growth in the traditional \"Keynesian\" manner. This led to growing recognition of the fact that in the long term monetary policy can only systematically control the price level and not real economic variables such as output growth or unemployment. Admittedly, over shorter horizons, monetary policy does indeed affect both real and nominal variables. However, it is by now widely accepted among policy-makers and in the academic literature, that deliberate attempts to exploit any short-run trade-offs between output and prices are likely to result in a permanently higher and more variable rate of inflation, with significant adverse consequences for resource allocation, long-run output and productivity growth. Against this background, the primary goal of monetary policy should be to achieve and maintain price stability, with any other economic objectives receiving emphasis only to the extent that price stability is not endangered.  The second fundamental change which I would like to highlight is the widespread tendency to delegate the decision-making power over monetary policy to independent central banks. Modern economic theory emphasises the inflationary bias in economic policy, which relates in particular to the so-called time-inconsistency issue, i.e. the problem of convincing the public that the monetary authorities will resist the temptation to stimulate output growth in the short run by creating \"surprise inflation\". Against the backdrop of negative past experience, the public is unlikely to have much faith in the authorities\\' promises to maintain low inflation. Unless these promises are underpinned by a credible form of pre-commitment, the equilibrium inflation rate will be higher than needed, with no better performance in terms of output and possibly even a deterioration. As a solution to this problem, it has been suggested that responsibility for monetary policy be separated from political control and to enshrine this in legislation. According to this view, central banks should be given the freedom to formulate and execute monetary policy in line with their primary objective as determined by the legislator, to whom they are accountable. Accountability may involve either a legal obligation for the central bank to give reckoning for the conduct of monetary policy or a commitment to explain its actions, for example, in regular reports and to parliament. This allows central banks to take a medium-term orientation and not to be distracted by short-term political motives, an approach which benefits the credibility, transparency and efficiency of monetary policy.  In line with the foregoing analysis, more and more EU central banks have over time been assigned the task of guaranteeing price stability, either explicitly by national law, or more informally as a reflection of an underlying culture of stability. In many cases, these reforms went hand-in-hand with the move towards a greater degree of central bank independence. These changes in national monetary legislation or at least the practice of central bank independence were beginning to be implemented well before the start of the Maastricht process. They were, however, further promoted by the recommendations of the Delors Committee with regard to the institutional arrangements for Stage Three of Monetary Union. The Committee\\'s proposals culminated in the inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB of the primary objective of price stability, the pursuit of which is delegated to an independent central bank system composed of the ECB and the national central banks of Member States.   2. The independence and accountability of the ESCB  The Treaty (in Article 107) and the Statute of the ESCB (in Article 7) both contain very clear provisions regarding the relationship with third parties, which leave no room whatsoever for misinterpretation. To quote a key sentence: \"neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body\". Moreover, the aforementioned authorities shall also - and I quote again - \"undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks\". To put it simply: the door to the single monetary policy is locked from both sides, and neither the ESCB nor third parties can open the door for political instructions. Even attempts to do so would already be in conflict with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.  For national central banks to become an integral part of the ESCB, Member States have to ensure that national legislation is compatible with the Treaty (Article 108) and the Statute of the ESCB (Article 14). This obligation of legal convergence does not require the full harmonisation of central bank statutes, but merely insists that inconsistencies with the Treaty be eliminated in respect of features such as institutional, personal, functional and financial independence. This requirement applies to all Member States, including those which may initially be unable to adopt the single currency owing to insufficient economic convergence. Exceptions are Denmark and the United Kingdom, which enjoy the right to \"opt in\" or \"opt out\" of EMU. Member States have made significant progress in recent years in amending their central bank statutes where needed in order to fulfil their Treaty obligations. For example, major reforms have taken place in Belgium, Spain, France, Luxembourg and Portugal, whilst in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland changes in legislation are pending. For those interested in further details, I would refer you to the EMI\\'s November 1996 Report entitled \"Progress towards convergence 1996\", which contains a detailed account for each country of the provisions which would need to be adapted.  The importance of these institutional arrangements for creating an appropriate monetary policy setting in Stage Three of EMU cannot be underestimated. I would like to illustrate this by reference to the following two arguments. First, these arrangements underline the continuity with the experience of the EU central banks with the most successful track record in terms of price stability over the past decades. In fact, in legal terms the ECB will enjoy an even higher degree of independence than the most independent national central bank at present. Moreover, these legal arrangements are firmly anchored in the Maastricht Treaty and could thus only be changed by a Treaty revision. As you know, this is a very difficult and time-consuming procedure, involving both the European Parliament and all the national parliaments, which thus ensures that such a step is not lightly taken. This brings me to the second point, namely that initially the ECB will have no track record of its own, other than the average track record that it may inherit from the participating national central banks. This implies that financial markets and the general public will assess the performance of the ECB on the basis of the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework adopted and the ability to act in accordance with its primary objective.  Taken together, these two arguments make it clear that the independence of the ESCB underpins the credibility and effectiveness of the single monetary policy and is thus a key condition for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Given this legal framework, the Governing Council of the ECB will be able to decide on the basis of its own judgement on the scope and timing of monetary policy actions and how they should be executed. Naturally, in its assessment the Governing Council will take account of a wide range of relevant factors - including the state of the economy in the Monetary Union - but only to the extent that they affect future price developments. This does not imply, as is sometimes suggested, that the secondary objective of providing support to the general economic policies in the Community has no real meaning. Nevertheless, under its mandate the ESCB can only pursue this additional goal provided it does not prejudice the primary objective of price stability.  A natural complement to the independent status of the ESCB are the Treaty provisions which make the ECB accountable for its policy actions. Accountability is reflected above all in the fact that the President and the other members of the Executive Board of the ECB, at their own initiative or on request, may be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament (Article 109b.3). A further aspect of accountability concerns the requirement to publish an annual report covering the single monetary policy and other activities of the ESCB. The President of the ECB presents this annual report to the Council and the European Parliament, which on that basis could subsequently hold a general debate. Reports on the activities of the ESCB will also be published during the year, at least quarterly, in addition to weekly financial statements. All these provisions - to which I may add the wish to deliver speeches to the public and statements to the press - clearly promote the transparency of monetary policy objectives, intentions and actions. They thereby support the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the same time, the Treaty recognises that the ECB cannot be made responsible for outcomes in terms of inflation month-by-month, since there are lags involved between a change in the course of monetary policy and its effect on prices. Moreover, in the short term, the inflation outcome may reflect the incidence of temporary or external factors over which the ECB has no control.  At this point, critical observers often confront me with the fact that the door is not completely shut against political interference, as the Treaty may seem to make an exception to the independence of the ESCB with regard to the exchange rate policy of the euro area. The ECOFIN Council may indeed conclude formal exchange rate arrangements with countries outside the EU, or formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to the currencies of these non-EU countries. This essentially reflects the current situation in most Member States, where the government determines the exchange rate rules (if any) and the central bank is responsible for the execution of this policy. On closer inspection, however, I do not fear a potential overburdening of the single monetary policy via this route.  To begin with, the participation of the euro in a multinational system with non-EU currencies is, to say the least, not on the agenda. You may or may not like it, but I do not see the likely emergence of a Bretton Woods Mark II in the foreseeable future - and by this I do not refer to just a couple of years. And as regards the \"general orientations for exchange rate policy\", while such orientations are indeed in the hands of the ECOFIN Council, they can be issued only either on a recommendation from the ECB or on a recommendation from the Commission - but after consulting the ECB. And Article 109 of the Treaty says explicitly that \"these general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability\".  Overall, it appears that sufficient \"checks and balances\" have been built into the procedure. I am confident that the view of the ECB in these exchange rate matters will carry a very high weight indeed and that the independence of the ESCB will not be affected. My confidence also finds support in the fact that the EMI has played a crucial role in helping to design the new exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) for establishing links between the euro and the non-participating EU currencies. To our satisfaction, the arrangement contains an explicit safeguard clause for the ECB (and other central banks) with regard to automatic intervention and financing at the margin, and also assigns a key role to the ECB (and other central banks) in negotiations that may culminate in realignments.  So far, I have mainly concentrated on the two \"monetary anchors\" that should help to provide for a stable single currency: the objective of price stability and the mandate for an independent monetary policy. We all know that other economic policies have an essential supporting role to play in the effort to maintain price stability on a durable basis. In this respect, ensuring sound and sustainable budgetary positions would certainly make the ESCB\\'s task a lot easier. Fortunately, a series of Treaty provisions support a high degree of fiscal discipline - which is of course also very much in the interests of Member States themselves. Already since the start of Stage Two, Member States have no longer been allowed to engage in monetary financing of budget deficits (Article 104). Correspondingly, for Stage Three, it is explicitly forbidden for the ESCB to supply credit facilities to government bodies, or to buy government debt instruments in the primary market. In addition, financial institutions are not allowed to grant credit to public authorities under preferential conditions (Article 104a). Furthermore, a bail-out of one Member State with financial problems by another country is strictly excluded (Article 104b). Finally, the Treaty obliges EU countries participating in the single currency to avoid excessive budget deficits (Article 104c). Compliance with this obligation will be assessed in the context of an elaborate procedure which will ultimately lead to the imposition of sanctions if no effective action is taken to correct an excessive deficit. The preventive nature and effectiveness of this procedure has recently been strengthened by the adoption of a Stability and Growth Pact, which specifies both the time limits for the consecutive steps in the procedure and the size of sanctions. Moreover, it commits each Member State to target a budgetary position that is close to balance or in surplus over the medium term.   Conclusion  I have taken this opportunity to spell out in detail how the move to a single currency in the EU will be accompanied by the creation of a new Community institution, the European System of Central Banks, whose independent status is guaranteed by the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. But I may perhaps conclude by saying that my confidence in the ability of the future ESCB to conduct in full independence a policy geared towards price stability is not based exclusively on my reading of the Maastricht Treaty. It is also based on our recent experience. EU central banks have been pursuing stability-oriented monetary policies for quite some time: otherwise it would have been impossible to achieve the downward convergence of inflation rates within the Community. As you know the most recent average rate of inflation is just a little above 2%. If this has become possible in Stage II, with central banks retaining their independence in conducting their own policies, why should this change when they will act jointly within the framework of the ESCB?

My subject matter for today is an important building-block for EMU, namely, the framework for the operation of monetary policy in the euro area. I plan to show you that its preparation is well-advanced, although some key issues will only finally be resolved by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), when it is formed in 1998. Accordingly, I shall spend most of my allotted time outlining the chosen monetary policy instruments and procedures of the ESCB and the considerations that have been raised relating to strategy. Please note that I shall not seek to cover issues of foreign exchange policy or operations, nor of payments systems. To conclude my talk, I shall also consider some practical aspects of the likely role of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in running monetary policy, linking these to provisions of the Treaty, the decentralisation of operations and information needed to pursue a given strategy.   1. Instruments and procedures  As is the case for all central banks, the ESCB will need to rely on a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures - its operational framework - for the implementation of its monetary policy strategy. Given the lead times involved in introducing changes in existing operational frameworks, it was necessary to take some decisions in this area at an early stage, so as to be ready in time for the start of EMU. Accordingly, the EMI Council has defined a set of monetary policy instruments that will be made available to the ESCB.  Various functional criteria were borne in mind in developing the framework. Most crucially, we consider that it should enable the ESCB efficiently to control its operational target, normally a money-market short-term interest rate. It should allow precise and differentiated signals of monetary policy intentions to be given. It should be capable of providing basic refinancing, absorbing liquidity and influencing the structural position of the banking system vis-à-vis the ESCB. The framework should also possibly help to control monetary aggregates, allow information to be extracted from market developments and contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment system. The selection of the operational framework has also been guided by principles of conformity with an open market economy, equal treatment, simplicity and cost efficiency, decentralisation, continuity, harmonisation and conformity with the setting of the ESCB\\'s decision-making.  In a nutshell, we envisage that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations, in most cases employing reverse transactions, but that it will also offer two standing facilities. It is envisaged that a broad range of counterparties will have access to ESCB operations. In addition, preparations are being made for an infrastructure that will allow the ESCB to impose minimum reserve requirements, if it so chooses. There are thus some contrasts with the framework used by the Federal Reserve, which mainly uses outright transactions with a limited number of counterparties.  Let me go into slightly more detail. There will be four types of open market operation. The most important will be the main refinancing operations, weekly reverse transactions with a maturity of two weeks, which will be executed on the basis of standard tenders. They will be used to steer interest rates, manage the liquidity situation in the market and signal the stance of monetary policy. In addition, there will be longer-term refinancing operations, monthly reverse transactions with a maturity of three months. They will only provide refinancing; they will not be intended to send signals to the market or guide rates. The ESCB may also carry out fine-tuning operations on an ad hoc basis. These will aim at managing market liquidity and steering interest rates, in particular in order to smooth the interest rate effects of unexpected liquidity fluctuations. They will primarily be executed as reverse transactions but may also take the form of outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits. Fine-tuning operations will normally be executed through quick tenders or bilateral procedures with counterparties. The ESCB will also have the possibility of affecting the structural liquidity position of the banking sector vis-à-vis the ESCB by issuing debt certificates, using reverse transactions and conducting outright transactions. All of the open market operations will be decentralised, although the Governing Council of the ECB may decide that certain fine-tuning operations should be executed in a centralised manner by the ECB.  Standing facilities aim at providing and absorbing overnight liquidity, thereby bounding overnight market interest rates and signalling the general stance of monetary policy. Two standing facilities will be available to the ESCB\\'s eligible counterparties. First, the marginal lending facility will allow them to satisfy their temporary liquidity needs by obtaining overnight liquidity from the national central banks (NCBs) at a pre-specified interest rate (above market rates) against eligible assets. Under normal circumstances, there will be no credit limits or other restrictions on counterparties\\' access to the facility except the sufficient availability of underlying assets. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will provide a ceiling for the overnight market interest rate under normal circumstances; the floor will be provided by the deposit facility, which will allow counterparties to make overnight deposits at a pre-specified interest rate with the NCBs. Under normal circumstances, there will be no limits on the corresponding deposit accounts or other restrictions on counterparties\\' access to the facility. The two standing facilities will be administered in a decentralised manner by the NCBs.  According to the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB may also require credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the NCBs. It will decide whether to do so in 1998. Reserves could be used to stabilise money market interest rates, to create or enlarge a structural liquidity shortage and, possibly, to contribute to the control of monetary expansion. For efficiency, reserve ratios might need to be imposed on a broader range of financial institutions than credit institutions alone. The amount of minimum reserves to be held by each individual institution would be determined in relation to the liability positions of its balance sheet. Reserves may be wholly or partially remunerated. In order to help stabilise money market rates, the system would include an averaging mechanism, implying that compliance would be determined on the basis of an institution\\'s average daily reserve holdings over a one-month maintenance period. I note that an averaging provision is also present in the system of minimum reserves in the United States.  In order to secure a single monetary policy stance and a level playing-field for counterparties across the whole of the euro area, common eligibility criteria, both for the counterparties and for the assets to be used by those counterparties in their operations with the ESCB, will be established. I envisage that an appropriate legal instrument will enforce the uniform conditions under which a broad range of counterparties will participate in the ESCB\\'s open market operations and standing facilities. A broad range of eligible counterparties is consistent with the principle of decentralisation in the execution of the ESCB\\'s monetary policy operations, it will enhance policy efficiency and equal treatment, and it will facilitate the smooth functioning of the payment system. Only in the case of fine-tuning operations may operational efficiency advocate dealing with a limited range of counterparties.   2. Monetary strategy  As regards the final objective itself, the Treaty provides unambiguous guidance that \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". However, in its pursuit of this objective, the ESCB, like all central banks, will face a complex transmission process from policy actions to price developments with long and variable lags. Thus, policy decisions directed at price stability must be both pre-emptive and forward-looking, taking into account all relevant information regarding the prospective evolution of prices and taking appropriate and timely action to ensure that the final objective is achieved. In addition, the need for credibility and consistency of the decision-making process over time will require the ESCB to establish a clear framework to guide the use of its monetary policy instruments with a view to achieving its final objective.  The assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies for the ESCB is guided by a number of general principles. The strategy has to put the ESCB in a position to pursue its final objective effectively. It needs to involve the formulation and announcement of targets so that the ESCB can be held accountable to the public for its actions. The process of setting targets and making decisions on the basis of the strategy must be clear to the public. The strategy has to enable the ESCB to meet its final objective over the medium term, thereby anchoring inflation expectations, but nevertheless providing the ESCB with some discretion in response to short-term deviations from the target. The strategy of the ESCB must build on the experience gained by participating NCBs before the start of Stage Three, and it must be consistent with the independent status granted to the ESCB by the Treaty.  Final decisions on strategy will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB in 1998. There are two potential candidate strategies, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. Common to both strategies is the fact that they are based on the same final objective - price stability; they are forward-looking; and in practice a wide range of indicators is employed under both strategies to assess the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance. The main factor distinguishing the two strategies is the role played by monetary aggregates.  It can be argued that a particular strength of the monetary targeting strategy is that it clearly indicates the responsibility of the ESCB for developments which are both easily observable and under its more direct control and which, therefore, can be interpreted by the public in a transparent manner. It also follows the strategy pursued by the central bank of the anchor country in the European exchange rate mechanism before the start of Stage Three. But as you are aware from US experience, the long-term stability of money demand will be a crucial factor in determining the effectiveness and scope of monetary targeting. Existing empirical studies carried out both within the EMI and elsewhere provide some evidence that, for selected groups of EU countries, area-wide money demand currently has desirable empirical properties. On the other hand, these studies are subject to data and methodological limitations and may not be representative of the situation in Stage Three. Uncertainty concerning the empirical properties of money demand in the euro area in Stage Three is the main argument put forward against a monetary targeting strategy. The possibility of damage to the credibility of the ESCB under a monetary targeting strategy could not be excluded if aggregates were highly volatile at the start of or during Stage Three.  With respect to an inflation targeting procedure, it is argued that this directly stresses the responsibility of the ESCB for achieving and maintaining price stability. Furthermore, policy actions under such a strategy can be consistently and directly linked to prospective price behaviour, which, if the strategy is credible, will affect public expectations in a favourable way. It should be noted, however, that to be successful, inflation targeting also requires stable relationships between various economic and financial indicators, on the one hand, and future inflation, on the other.  Overall, however, the similarities in the behaviour of those central banks that pursue these two strategies are greater than the differences. Regardless of their choice of strategy, they all monitor a wide and similar set of economic and financial variables as indicators in the determination of the monetary policy stance. Moreover, experience suggests that the general principles set out above could be achieved in different ways. The ESCB may consequently face the choice not only of pursuing either a monetary or direct inflation targeting strategy, but also of adopting a framework which places particular emphasis on monetary targets while using supplementary elements from direct inflation targeting strategies, or vice versa. To conclude, while a few years ago I thought that the choice between these two strategies could represent a major challenge for the ECB Council, I believe now that in practice the contrast between them is far less dramatic than would appear at first sight.   3. The role of the ESCB in conducting monetary policy  I have emphasised the fact that some details of the role of the ESCB will emerge closer to the date for the introduction of the euro. Others will evolve with practical experience. Nonetheless, some considerations can be adduced, since the way in which monetary policy will be implemented in Stage Three of EMU will depend inter alia on the provisions of the Treaty, the agreements reached in relation to decentralisation (particularly concerning instruments and procedures), and the specific requirements (in terms of information, data etc.) for running the monetary policy strategy efficiently in the circumstances which will prevail in Stage Three.  Commencing with the Treaty, in terms of objectives it states unambiguously that the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community. The Treaty notes that the ESCB will pursue its objectives independently; neither the ECB nor any national central bank, nor any member of their decision making bodies, shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any governments of a Member State or from any other body. This provision is supported by the fact that the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the Governors of the participating national central banks, who will together form the Governing Council of the ECB, will have long terms of office and will only be dismissible for serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties. Meanwhile, monetary financing of government deficits is explicitly excluded by the Treaty.  Besides defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Community, the Treaty states that the ESCB will have the complementary central-banking tasks of conducting foreign exchange operations, holding and managing the official foreign reserves of the Member States, and promoting the smooth operation of payments systems. The ECB Governing Council shall also have the exclusive right to authorise issue of banknotes in the euro area. In all cases, the ESCB shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources.  The direction of monetary policy will be carried out in a way familiar from other federal central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the Deutsche Bundesbank. The Governing Council will formulate the monetary policy of the euro area and establish the necessary guidelines for its implementation during its meetings, to be held at least 10 times a year; the members of the Governing Council will have the facility to cast their votes between these times by teleconference. Meanwhile the Executive Board will implement monetary policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the Governing Council.  In common with all independent central banks, the ESCB is to be held accountable for its actions in various ways. First there are Treaty provisions that the President or other members of the Executive Board may be required to attend hearings at the European Parliament. Second, there is a requirement to publish an Annual Report covering the single monetary policy and the other activities of the ESCB, which also has to be presented to the Council and the European Parliament, where it may trigger a general debate. Third, reports on ESCB activities will be published during the year, at least quarterly, in addition to weekly financial statements.  As regards the division of operational tasks between the centre (the ECB) and the periphery (NCBs), the Treaty states that the Governing Council of the ECB shall take the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the ESCB. It shall formulate the single monetary policy, take key decisions and establish the necessary guidelines for their implementation. The Executive Board shall implement monetary policy and give the necessary instructions to the NCBs. The Treaty requires that to the extent deemed possible and appropriate the ECB shall have recourse to the NCBs to carry out operations which form part of the tasks of the ESCB. Operations will hence neither be concentrated on one \"branch\", as has evolved for the New York Fed in the US, nor will they be centralised at the ECB itself. I am sure that as a rule the implementation of the centrally defined monetary policy will be carried out by the NCBs, but I do not exclude occasional direct intervention by the ECB itself.  Turning to the types of information needed for the ECB to conduct monetary policy in the euro area, the first point to make is that the main focus will be on area-wide information. In particular, the target of the ESCB in terms of price stability is defined across the euro area as a whole. Accordingly, the ESCB will wish to have its own area-wide forecasts of inflation and other key variables as a support to monetary policy. Moreover, it has already been noted that whatever strategy is adopted, there will be a number of common elements making up the desired information set. In this context, an important factor will be knowledge of the monetary policy transmission process, in particular that aspect of the transmission process which relates to the financial environment in Stage Three. EMI research has already provided an insight into the details of the average transmission process and suitable indicator variables at a Union-wide level. However, the results are still only partial and are considered as preliminary.  A second aspect will be the use of a broad set of indicator variables, to help in assessing risks to future price stability. In line with prevailing practice, including that of the Federal Reserve, it would seem appropriate for these to include financial variables (in particular the money market yield curve, money and credit aggregates, credit market conditions, bond yields, exchange rates and other asset prices) and various non-financial variables (such as price and cost variables, indicators of aggregate demand and supply conditions including the output gap, the balance of payments and expectations surveys). Within the set of indicators employed by the ESCB, monetary aggregates should be assigned a prominent role, provided that money demand is sufficiently stable in the long run.  A feature of the ESCB\\'s environment - not of course present in the United States - will be the significance of structural differences across countries within the single currency area, owing to the existence of national differences in institutions, regulations, traditions and policies. The stance of the single monetary policy of the ESCB can only be set to ensure that it will be appropriate for the euro area as a whole; nevertheless it will be important for the ESCB to be fully aware of any differential impact of its policies across Member States, not least because inflation in an individual Member State may spill over into the euro area as a whole.  While there will be a single monetary policy, cross-country differences are also likely to prevail in the area of other economic policies, in particular fiscal and labour market policies. The responsibility for defining and conducting these economic policies will mainly lie with the Member States. The largely decentralised set-up of economic policies will be particularly important in the field of public finance. The Treaty includes several provisions which aim at ensuring the budgetary discipline of national authorities in Stage Three; and Secondary Community legislation (the Stability and Growth Pact) to strengthen budgetary discipline in Stage Three is currently under discussion in Community bodies. But it is clear that there will not be any Union-wide decision making on fiscal policies. It will be important for all monetary strategies that the overall fiscal stance should be compatible with a stability-oriented monetary policy. Consequently, as monetary policy cannot achieve its goal of price stability without adequate support from fiscal policy, the ESCB will wish to monitor fiscal policies closely.  Moreover, when implementing a monetary policy strategy for Stage Three, it should be borne in mind that the ESCB will face two particular challenges at the start of Stage Three. Firstly, the ESCB will have no track record of its own and must, therefore, attach the utmost importance to establishing and maintaining a high degree of credibility. Secondly, the transition to Stage Three will constitute a major shift in regime, which will imply a high degree of uncertainty concerning economic and financial conditions and developments in the euro area as well as the future relationships between major macroeconomic variables. It will not be easy for the ECB Council to draw firm conclusions from the observation of indicators; in particular, changes in the various Ms or shifts in the yield curves will not be easy to interpret. Given the overriding importance to establish credibility, the ECB will have to err on the side of caution.   Conclusion  To conclude, the preparation of the framework for the monetary policy instruments and strategy to be employed in Stage Three of EMU is well-advanced, although the finalisation of some of the key aspects (notably the use and scope of minimum reserves and the choice between monetary and inflation targeting) will only be undertaken by the ECB Governing Council itself in 1998. The Treaty lays down the broad guidelines for the actual implementation of monetary policy, and progress has been made in determining the overall scope of the decentralisation of operations. As regards the types of information that the ESCB will require to fulfil its role to conduct monetary policy, area-wide developments require the sharpest focus, although developments in individual countries are also of relevance, not least in the case of fiscal policy.

Progress towards economic convergence  The dangers of a lack of convergence when countries enter EMU are self-evident. Notably, if fiscal positions are not initially under control, there may be repercussions on monetary policy from large deficits, and adverse spillovers across borders affecting the Monetary Union as a whole from lax fiscal policies in individual Member States. Similar arguments apply in respect of inflation. These difficulties are far from theoretical. With such a unique enterprise as EMU, we will have to live with the possibility of teething troubles during the crucial \"running in\" period, putting considerable strain on the strategy and the technical capabilities of the ECB. Such strain could become unbearable or, to put it less dramatically, could lead to a dangerously unbalanced policy mix if it were compounded by the consequences of initially weak budgetary positions in the member countries.  As regards current performance, important progress has been made in respect of the downward convergence of inflation and bond yields, and exchange rate stability has to date been broadly maintained. However, on the fiscal side, deficits in 1996 substantially overshot the benchmark laid down in the Treaty in most Member States, despite efforts at consolidation. Debt ratios have continued to rise in the aggregate, despite favourable trends in some Member States. In my view, the composition of consolidation continued to rely excessively on high revenue ratios and less than is desirable on expenditure restraint. Moreover, there were measures with a temporary effect, which cannot contribute to sustainable convergence. Given its central role, I shall henceforth focus on fiscal convergence.  As you know, the decision to select the countries will be made by the Heads of State or Government during the Spring of 1998. I do not know how they will interpret the convergence criteria. But I do know how I should like the advice by the EMI Council to be formulated.  In assessing the fiscal criteria, we should stick to both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty; and the Treaty says three things, not one. Firstly, it establishes the two reference values, the 3% deficit ceiling and the 60% debt ceiling. Secondly, it accepts deviations from these reference values on certain conditions which are described carefully, but are not quantified. Thirdly, it insists on the need to have sustainable positions - in fact, it even uses this expression twice: to cover all convergence criteria and, specifically, sustainability of budgetary positions. Consideration of the risks suggests two conclusions. First, deviations from the reference values should be granted sparingly by interpreting the words used by the Treaty in a carefully restrictive way; and, second, compliance with the reference values should be regarded as sufficient for eligibility only if the deficit and debt ratios observed for 1997 are genuinely sustainable. In short, in case of doubt when applying the second and third prescriptions of the Treaty, we should lean towards caution.  Concerning policy, the fiscal imbalances existing in the Union require the implementation of measures with lasting effects. Given distortions imposed by too high a level of fiscal levies, priority for adjustment will have to lie with the expenditure side of the budget, notably in non-productive expenditure. Fiscal consolidation can only lead to a lasting improvement in the growth potential of the Union if it is pursued with a long-term perspective, in a credible and determined manner. It is not sufficient that countries only aim to ensure that they comply with the Treaty reference values in the coming years. It is also necessary that they create sufficient room for manoeuvre to cope with adverse cyclical developments and that they implement measures for coping with new budgetary challenges such as the ageing of populations.   2. The role of the European Central Bank   Monetary policy: The Treaty provides unambiguous guidance that \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". However, in its pursuit of this objective, the ESCB, like all central banks, will face a complex transmission process from policy actions to price developments with long and variable lags. Thus, policy decisions must be both pre-emptive and forward-looking, taking into account all relevant information regarding the prospective evolution of prices and taking appropriate and timely action to ensure that the final objective is achieved. In addition, the need for credibility and consistency of the decision-making process over time will require the ESCB to establish a clear framework to guide use of its monetary policy instruments with a view to achieving its final target. Final decisions on strategy will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB.  There are two potential candidate strategies, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. It can be argued that a particular strength of the monetary targeting strategy is that it clearly indicates the responsibility of the ESCB for developments which are both easily observable and under its more direct control. It also follows the strategy pursued by the central bank of the anchor country in the EMS. At the same time the long-term stability of money demand in the euro area is a crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of monetary targeting. Empirical studies provide some evidence that, for selected groups of EU countries, area-wide money demand currently has these desirable properties. On the other hand, these studies are subject to data and methodological limitations and may not be representative of the situation in Stage Three. With respect to an inflation targeting procedure, it is argued that it directly stresses the responsibility of the ESCB for achieving and maintaining price stability. Furthermore, policy actions under such a strategy can be consistently and directly linked to prospective price behaviour, which, if the strategy is credible, will affect public expectations in a favourable way. It should be noted, however, that to be successful, inflation targeting also requires stable relationships between various economic and financial indicators, on the one hand, and future inflation, on the other.  Overall, the similarities in the behaviour of central banks that pursue these two strategies are greater than the differences. Regardless of their choice of strategy, they all monitor a wide and similar set of economic and financial variables as indicators in the determination of the monetary policy stance.  For the implementation of its strategy, the ESCB will need to rely on a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures which will constitute its operational framework. This framework should enable the ESCB to control its operational target, normally a short-term interest rate, efficiently. It should allow signals of monetary policy intentions to be given with precision and differentiation. It should be capable of providing basic refinancing, absorbing liquidity and influencing the structural position of the banking system vis-à-vis the ESCB. It would also be desirable that the framework helps to control monetary aggregates, allows adequate information to be extracted from market developments and contributes to the smooth functioning of the payment system. It is envisaged that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations, but that it will also offer two standing facilities. In addition, preparations are being made for the ECB to impose minimum reserve requirements, if it chooses.   Foreign exchange policy: From the start of Stage Three, the ESCB will have the capacity to conduct foreign exchange intervention. The ESCB will conduct foreign exchange intervention by means of transactions on the foreign reserves transferred from the NCBs to the ECB (up to an amount equivalent to EURO 50 billion). The management of foreign assets which are not pooled will be subject to guidelines issued by the ECB. The decisions related to intervention will be taken by the ECB; the implementation of such decisions will be either centralised or decentralised within the ESCB.  The Treaty does not prescribe any specific exchange rate arrangement vis-à-vis non-EU currencies. In any event, the ESCB will have the technical capacity to conduct, if need be, intervention operations in order to counteract excessive or erratic exchange rate fluctuations of the euro against the major non-EU currencies.  On the other hand, as part of the future exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area and other EU countries, a new exchange rate mechanism has already been agreed upon. In the context of this ERM II, intervention will be used as a supportive instrument, in conjunction with other policy measures, including appropriate fiscal and monetary policies conducive to economic convergence and exchange rate stability. The new mechanism will be based on central rates, defined vis-à-vis the euro for the participating non-euro area currencies; there will be no parity grid. A standard fluctuation band, which is expected to be 15%, will be established for these currencies around their central rates. Participating non-euro area Member States could establish, on a bilateral basis, fluctuation bands between their currencies and intervention arrangements aimed at limiting excessive bilateral exchange rate oscillations. Also, the exchange rate policy co-operation between non-euro area NCBs and the ECB could - in various forms - be strengthened further. Foreign exchange intervention and financing at the standard wide margins will, in principle, be automatic and unlimited. However, the ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs will have the possibility of suspending intervention and financing if these were to impinge on their primary objective of maintaining price stability.   Independence: As noted, the Treaty states that \"the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\". The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will enjoy full independence to determine the appropriate level of interest rates in order to satisfy this requirement of the Treaty; \"neither the ECB nor any national central bank shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, governments of a Member State or any other body\". Moreover, the members of the ECB\\'s Executive Board and the Governors of the participating national central banks, who will together form the ECB Governing Council, will have long terms of office and will only be dismissible for serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties. These provisions imply that the concept of monetary stability will benefit from explicit legal protection.   Supervision: The Maastricht Treaty assigns practically no role to the ESCB in banking supervision, though the Statute of the ESCB explicitly states that it has the obligation to \"promote the smooth operation of payment systems\". It is true that the Statute also stipulates that \"the ESCB shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system\". This, however, tends to imply that other authorities are likely to be competent for the formulation of such policies. The safeguarding of financial stability is not explicitly mentioned as an objective of the ESCB, but I would expect the ESCB to play an important role in this \"macro-prudential\" area.   TARGET: To support the integration of the money market and thereby the singleness of the monetary policy, the EMI and the NCBs are developing an interbank funds transfer system, called TARGET, that will be able to process cross-border payments denominated in euro as smoothly as if they were domestic payments. It will interlink the domestic RTGS systems which NCBs have agreed to implement in their respective countries. Participation in the national RTGS systems will be determined by the NCBs. To avoid impediments to the efficient conduct of the single monetary policy, a certain degree of harmonisation of the features of the national RTGS systems within the euro area will be ensured in three respects: the provision of intraday liquidity, operating hours, and pricing policy. Focusing on the issue of liquidity, the value of payment orders being sent through TARGET may, for any participant at any given point in the course of the day, exceed the value of payment orders being received. To counter the ensuing liquidity shortfall which might delay settlement, intraday liquidity will be provided by NCBs, either by granting participants the right to make use of their reserve deposits with them or by providing them with intraday credit. At the end of the day, RTGS participants in the euro area that are eligible counterparties for monetary policy operations of the ESCB may draw on the marginal lending facility with their NCB in order to balance the position in their accounts.   3. The euro as an international reserve currency  The euro area is likely to be a global player. EMU will entail the creation of a major new global currency, which will join the dollar and the yen, reinforcing a tripolar system. Although this may take decades to occur (if past history is taken as a reliable guide), it could also occur much more rapidly than in the past given the nature of today\\'s financial markets. The impact of this on reserve holding may be considered under several headings.  EMU could affect international use of the euro through, first, the creation of a large trading area with a single currency. This fact would favour greater use of the euro in the invoicing of trade, which in turn would tend to encourage use of the euro in financial transactions. Moreover, the size of the euro trading area would encourage third countries to stabilise their currencies vis-à-vis the euro, which may increase the demand for the euro as a reserve currency. However, these factors may take time to be felt and, in any case, cannot be expected to operate in a mechanical way as a critical mass would need to be reached before the established advantages of the dollar as an international currency can start to be eroded.  Second, there is the creation of a large and efficient financial market operating in euro. The introduction of a single currency should, in combination with the implementation of the single market, strengthen market forces and encourage regulatory developments leading toward the full integration of national financial markets in the euro area. To the extent that this would contribute to the efficiency, liquidity and range of financial services offered in the euro area\\'s financial market, the euro would also become a more attractive currency for international investors and issuers, including central banks. Clearly, the size and efficiency of the euro financial market would be not only a determinant but also a result of the international role of the euro.  Third, EMU may alter the risk features of euro-denominated financial instruments. To the extent that the volatility of the euro\\'s exchange rate may be lower than that of the former national currencies, euro assets and liabilities may be seen as less risky and, therefore, more attractive to international investors and borrowers, again including central banks. The same argument may apply to euro interest rates, to the extent that also these may be less influenced by country-specific shocks (although they will be more influenced by area-wide shocks). On the other hand, whether the euro would offer more or fewer opportunities for risk diversification is very difficult to predict, since it would depend on both the variances and the covariances of the returns on assets denominated in euro and in other currencies.

I am acutely aware that the topic we are to discuss today is one which has been addressed in great depth and with much passion in this country; I hope the panel will advance that debate further. The main focus of my remarks is the economic benefits that members of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) can expect to achieve, an assessment of costs, and how we can construct the Monetary Union so as to be sure that the net benefits are achieved. First, however, I would like to remind you briefly of the role of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), and of the progress that has been made in the preparations for EMU.   1 The EMI and the preparations for EMU  In a nutshell, the EMI is an organisation of the European Union, established under the Maastricht Treaty. Its members are the central banks of the EU Member States. Based in Frankfurt, it came into being on 1 January 1994, and currently has a staff of around 250. The EMI was established to contribute to the realisation of the conditions necessary for the transition to EMU; it is a temporary institution which will be dissolved when the European Central Bank (ECB) is established, i.e. some time in the second quarter of 1998. Its three main functions are: first, at this stage, i.e. before the start of EMU, further strengthening co-operation among the national central banks and the co-ordination of national monetary policies with the aim of ensuring price stability; second, providing advice to the EU Council regarding the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by Member States adopting the single currency; and, third, undertaking the necessary preparations required for EMU. I shall not deal with the first function; the second will enter my remarks later. For now, I would like to focus on the highly advanced state of preparatory work.  The preparations for EMU involve close collaboration between the EMI and the national central banks. Concerning preparatory work by the EMI, I would highlight, inter alia, that the scenario for the changeover to the euro after the beginning of EMU has been agreed; operational aspects of monetary policy for the ESCB, including instruments and procedures, have been specified in some detail, and the factors underlying the eventual choice of strategy by the ECB have been outlined; the foreign exchange relationship to be established between the Monetary Union and Member States which are not participants (ERM II) has been defined; and secondary Community legislation on the introduction of the euro (including the continuity of contracts after the start of Stage Three and technical rules for the conversion rates) will become effective this year.  There are a large number of other areas in which preparatory work for the establishment of the ECB and the ESCB is being carried forward by the EMI, including issues relating to the interlinking of national payment systems (the TARGET project); preparation of euro banknotes; foreign exchange reserve management; statistical requirements; securities settlement systems; harmonisation of accounting rules and standards; information and communications systems; and further legal issues.  A great deal of work remains to be done, notably the detailed specification of all of the technical features of the various monetary policy instruments and procedures, and more generally in respect of the implementation of the overall framework so that a single monetary policy can operate smoothly from the outset. This will undoubtedly reveal many hurdles - but I am confident that they will be overcome. All things considered, the EMI is well on track to achieve its objective of ensuring that all of the preparations will be finalised so as to allow EMU to start on 1 January 1999.   2 Benefits of EMU  I begin with the realistic expectation that EMU will ensure price stability. Price stability is laid down in the Maastricht Treaty as the primary objective of the single monetary policy, to be explicitly incorporated in the statutes of participating national central banks. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will enjoy full independence to determine the appropriate level of interest rates in order to satisfy this requirement of the Treaty. Moreover, the members of the ECB\\'s Executive Board and the Governors of the participating national central banks, who will together form the ECB Governing Council, will have long terms of office and will only be dismissible for serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties. These provisions imply that the concept of monetary stability will benefit from explicit legal protection. The ECB should also reap reputational benefits, inherited from its constituent central banks. We should bear in mind that as a result of generally conservative monetary policies for a number of years, the average rate of inflation in the EU is now just a little above two per cent.  The benefits of price stability are increasingly appreciated. Notably, there is growing awareness that inflation, and inflation uncertainty, lead to a misallocation of resources, and hence the maintenance of price stability is associated with significant efficiency gains, and longer-term benefits to growth. In this context, EMU will be a tool to consolidate the progress towards price stability already made and to firmly anchor inflation expectations. For some countries, where inflation expectations may still be higher due to their shorter track record in terms of monetary stability, EMU will also bring lower interest rates, both nominal (due to lower inflation) and real (as inflation - and exchange rate - risk premia fall), thus providing a stimulus to investment and to growth in the euro area as a whole. There should also be benefits from EMU in terms of a reduction in the costs of disinflation following inflationary \"shocks\". For in the absence of EMU, maintenance of the option to alter the exchange rate may be taken as leaving open the possibility to devalue, thus giving credence to agents\\' expectations of higher future inflation.  A further important benefit of EMU is that it will remove the risk of serious real exchange rate misalignments. These may not only hinder economic growth and give rise to a misallocation of resources; they may also trigger protectionism and, hence, pose a threat to free trade. Such misalignments are particularly devastating in Europe given the level of economic integration; you will recall that sudden sharp falls in currencies such as the lira and sterling some time ago immediately led to - rather isolated - calls for protection and compensation. Such pressures, if unchecked, could put the survival of the Single Market, and all the benefits it brings to producers and consumers, at risk. Note, in this respect, two facts. We have achieved inside Europe a spectacular downward convergence of inflation rates. At the same time, the Single Market implies generalised competition and constant pressure on profit margins. In such a world - and this is a new world - even relatively small nominal exchange rate movements turn into real misalignments, with disruptive effects on trade flows and business planning.  Short-term intra-EU exchange rate volatility will, of course, also be eliminated. Such volatility can again have a direct effect on trade and investment, as is shown by most empirical studies. In any event, the argument that the increased use of hedging instruments makes such volatility a matter of indifference seems exaggerated. Such instruments are not available to all economic agents, nor are they of negligible cost. It may not even be optimal to fully hedge against a single type of risk, since it may leave the firm more exposed to other types of risk, as ably demonstrated in Professor David Currie\\'s recent paper entitled \"Pros and cons of EMU\".  Furthermore, the benefits of economic integration afforded by the Single Market process will be enhanced once the transactions costs of exchanging different currencies are eliminated. These costs, which include commissions, the bid/offer spread and overall cash management costs, otherwise constitute a dead-weight loss for society as a whole and are far from insignificant - although I acknowledge that they are difficult to measure. Equally, they in effect form an additional layer of protection for domestic producers; a single currency will make prices across the euro area directly comparable, which should increase competition and hence efficiency and underpin progress towards a Single Market.  A number of further positive effects on growth will flow from the elimination of separate currencies. I have already referred to the potential for the reduction of risk premia built into real interest rates, which in turn will stimulate productive investment. By facilitating the development of deep and integrated securities markets, the single currency should further reduce long-term rates via the elimination of an illiquidity premium. In addition, a wider and deeper capital market will improve intermediation between savers and investors. At a macroeconomic level, the savings/investment balance as reflected in the current account of the balance of payments will become much less of a constraint within the individual participating economies. An EMU country that shows valuable and attractive investment opportunities will be able to attract more capital without running into a balance of payments constraint. Moreover, foreign direct investment is sensitive both to exchange rate volatility and to the risk of lasting real exchange rate misalignments, and hence should benefit from EMU.  A number of the benefits enumerated above increase with the existing degree of integration. In this context, it is important to stress that the integration of the real economies and financial markets of the Member States has already reached a high level. According to a recent estimate, around two-thirds of EU trade is intra-EU, an unparalleled degree of real integration. But equally, the single currency should stimulate further economic integration, with efficiency gains. Such further integration will be beneficial also in that it may reduce the likelihood of so-called asymmetric shocks, one of the arguments used in the debate about the dangers of EMU, to which I shall now turn.   3 Criticisms of EMU  Although the case given is a sound one, the arguments put forward by the opponents of EMU cannot, and should not, be disregarded but should be considered seriously and their merits acknowledged, not least because they contain useful warnings about potential problems.  The main policy or even \"political\" argument often put forward against EMU is that it entails the loss of monetary sovereignty, i.e. the ability to use monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives. However, this argument only retains force if countries were to disagree on the final objective of monetary policy; instead, there has been a growing consensus over the last decade or more that monetary policy cannot influence economic activity and unemployment beyond the short term. This has been the result of the experience of the 1970s, both in Europe and in the United States, which demonstrated the futility of attempts to trade inflation off against unemployment, as well as the growing awareness that inflation erodes growth potential. This has led to an intellectual and political conversion to the cause of price stability and to world-wide acceptance of it as the primary objective of monetary policy. At the EU level, since monetary policies have a common objective, and given the potential for spillovers of national policy decisions in this area, it is hard to see what is lost by sharing responsibility for the conduct of a single monetary policy - which is, in essence, what EMU means. I might add that the degree to which countries may adopt fully independent national monetary policies is itself limited by the power of the international financial markets, whose ability to punish perceived monetary laxity with rising bond yields and a falling currency has strengthened in recent years.  There are, however, other arguments which to my mind carry greater weight.  First, there will clearly be costs to the changeover, such as training, updating computer systems, and adjustments to cash dispensers and vending machines. These are, however, one-off costs, which should be weighed against certain permanently accruing benefits. Second, there may be differential effects of a single monetary policy on national economies, owing to differences in the monetary transmission process. However, such differences can be exaggerated. Moreover, the market forces unleashed by EMU should themselves promote convergence in this area, as, for example, sustained low inflation makes long-term fixed rate mortgage finance attractive.  Perhaps the strongest argument put forward against establishing EMU is that individual countries should retain the ability to change their exchange rates as a means of responding to adverse asymmetric shocks - shocks which affect the domestic economy but not the euro area as a whole. One preliminary remark, however. I do not believe that asymmetric shocks are likely to be frequent events in western Europe. First, our economies remain rather similar in structure and are relatively diversified, certainly in comparison with the United States. To take an example, the automobile industry plays an important role in practically all our countries. It is heavily concentrated in some areas of the United States. Second, whenever we had a genuinely asymmetric shock in the past - German unification or, to a lesser extent, the oil shock - what really mattered was not so much the asymmetric nature of the shock, but the asymmetry of the policy reactions. This was evident in the case of the oil shock; and the impact of German unification on interest rates would have been significantly weaker if the Germans had not allowed their public sector borrowing requirement to rise by the equivalent of several percent of GDP. With the emergence of a genuinely converging \"stability culture\" in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies the risk of asymmetric policy reactions during the coming years would appear to me to be much smaller than any time since the end of the last war.  Be that as it may, I do not deny that market rigidities in most EU countries are a source of concern. There is no doubt that labour and also some goods and services markets show insufficient flexibility. However, I disagree with the view that this is an argument against EMU. The source of the problem lies in structural rigidities that prevent timely adjustment in domestic prices and wages. The reduction of such rigidities, especially in labour markets, is an objective which has to be pursued irrespective of Monetary Union. Keeping the exchange rate option - which means, to put it bluntly, the devaluation option - may even foster the illusion in some circles that structural adjustments do not require immediate attention.  Moreover, in an environment of real labour market rigidities, changing the nominal exchange rate may not be effective against shocks. If real wage decline is needed to prevent a negative shock from raising unemployment, it has to be the case that wage setters are prepared to allow it through a depreciation of the national currency but at the same time are not willing to accept it through nominal wage restraint. This presupposes a degree of \"money illusion\", which is present at most in the very short run.  What role might fiscal policy play in this context? As critics of EMU note, there is no provision under current fiscal arrangements for transfers between Member States of a magnitude sufficient to offset differences in labour market rigidities. Moreover, to minimise the risk of an adverse policy mix and an excessive burden on monetary policy, the countries participating in EMU have agreed to exercise a concerted discipline in the conduct of their fiscal management, with accepted sanctions in the case of excessive deficits. But even if such discipline reduces the scope for increasing fiscal deficits and public debts, the operation of automatic stabilisers should still be available to stabilise the economy, provided the structural deficit is close to zero. This should be a worthwhile objective with or without EMU.   4 How do we ensure that the net benefits are achieved?  Two years ago, I would have cited a number of challenges still to be faced in ensuring that benefits of EMU are secured, notably a mutually satisfactory exchange rate relation between countries within and outside the euro area and an adequate system of control of fiscal deficits once EMU is up and running. Since these have been addressed, I would like to focus on the key remaining elements, which I have already foreshadowed, namely those of ensuring sustainable convergence among countries before they join EMU and, in the longer term, enhanced labour market flexibility.  The dangers of a lack of convergence when countries enter EMU are self-evident. If fiscal positions are not initially under control, there may be repercussions on the single monetary policy from large deficits, and adverse spillovers across borders affecting the Monetary Union as a whole from lax fiscal policies in individual Member States. These difficulties are far from theoretical. We must be aware that with such a unique enterprise as EMU, with no historical precedent, and operating in such an uncertain world environment, we will have to live with the possibility of teething troubles during the crucial \"running in\" period, putting considerable strain on the strategy and the technical capabilities of the ECB. Such strain could become unbearable or, to put it less dramatically, could lead to a dangerously unbalanced policy mix if it were compounded by the consequences of initially weak budgetary positions in the member countries.  The authors of the Maastricht Treaty were acutely aware of these dangers and, consequently, required entrants to show a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to compliance with various convergence criteria. The EMI is assigned an important role in the assessment of such convergence.  As regards current performance, I would acknowledge that important progress has been made in respect of the downward convergence of inflation and bond yields, and exchange rate stability has to date been broadly maintained. In a welcome development, Finland and Italy are now ERM members. However, on the fiscal side, deficits in 1996 substantially overshot the benchmark laid down in the Treaty in most Member State, despite efforts aimed at consolidation. Debt ratios have continued to rise in the aggregate, despite favourable trends in some Member States. In my view, the composition of consolidation continued to rely excessively on high revenue ratios and less than is desirable on expenditure restraint. Moreover, there were measures with a one-off effect, which cannot contribute to sustainable convergence.  Given the crucial importance of the issue, let me outline how I would like to see the EMI\\'s advice on the eventual assessment of fiscal positions being given. In essence, we should stick to both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty; and the Treaty says three things, not one. Firstly, it establishes the two reference values which should not be exceeded: the 3% deficit ceiling and the 60% debt ceiling. Secondly, it accepts deviations from these reference values on certain conditions which are described carefully, but are not quantified. Thirdly, it insists on the need to have sustainable positions - in fact, it even uses this expression twice: to cover all convergence criteria and, in addition, to refer specifically to the sustainability of budgetary positions. Consideration of the risks, as I have outlined, suggests two conclusions. First, deviations from the reference values should be granted sparingly by interpreting the words used by the Treaty in a carefully restrictive way; and, second, compliance with the reference values should be regarded as sufficient for eligibility only if the deficit and debt ratios observed for 1997 are genuinely sustainable. In short, in case of doubt when applying the second and third prescriptions of the Treaty, we should lean towards caution.  Beyond convergence, I consider that the greatest challenge that most EU countries face is in the labour market. I have already noted that wage and price flexibility is essential to facilitate economic adjustment to various kinds of shocks that may hit individual EU economies from time to time. With or without EMU, employment policies have to be in the forefront of attention of European policy-makers. The recent record of the Union in terms of job creation is dismal; employment has barely risen in the Union as a whole since the cyclical trough in 1993, and projections envisage little improvement. This points to the crucial need for continued labour cost moderation and enhanced labour market reforms - including attention to tax and social security systems - across the EU. For it is evident that the recovery of output growth alone will be insufficient to remedy deep-seated structural patterns of unemployment. A cause for optimism in this respect is that the enhanced competition that EMU in combination with the Single Market will unleash will be fertile ground for those arguing in favour of measures of labour market deregulation and reform of bargaining structures.   Conclusion  The preparations for EMU are far advanced. In combination with the strong political commitment to go ahead with EMU and with the remarkable downward convergence of inflation rates, this has led to enhanced - albeit volatile - expectations in financial markets that EMU will come about. I believe that EMU will lead to major benefits for participants, although potential costs should not be disregarded. To minimise these costs and therefore to ensure large and lasting net benefits, countries entering the Monetary Union should be in a state of sustainable macroeconomic convergence and ready to improve the working of their labour markets as well as to reduce the often very substantial indirect labour costs. This is needed anyhow if they are to achieve a reduction in the unacceptable current levels of unemployment.   ']\n",
      "['1997-02-07', 'Alexandre Lamfalussy', 'Conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association', 'Address by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system, Budapest, 7 February 1997', '  Conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association   Address by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system, Budapest, 7 February 1997 For at least three reasons, I have accepted with pleasure the invitation to share some thoughts with you on the occasion of these tenth anniversary celebrations.  First, for obvious personal reasons, I enjoy spending some time in Hungary - even if it is only for less than a day.  Second, I am absolutely convinced that an efficient financial system in general, and an efficient banking system in particular, together comprise an indispensable precondition for the proper functioning of a market economy and, indeed, for economic growth. Not a sufficient condition, but a necessary one.  Third, I note that Hungary has made substantial progress in this direction in four key areas. The larger part of the Hungarian banking system is now in genuinely private hands; the financial health of most banks (which, not so long ago, was - to put it mildly - precarious) has improved; the legal, accounting and regulatory framework has been consolidated, and, last but not least, there is now an interbank payment system in place which can no longer be qualified as prehistoric. Admittedly, in all these areas progress is still possible and desirable, but what has been achieved so far now enables you to address a number of institutional issues for the solution of which Western experience is fast becoming increasingly and directly relevant.  But before considering some of these issues, allow me to make some remarks about the macroeconomic situation of the Hungarian economy and about the new framework within which the National Bank of Hungary will be operating. Both these areas are of key importance for the management of your banks. At the same time, both have a bearing on Hungary\\'s declared intention to join the European Union (and within this, probably at a later stage, also EMU). Last but not least, both are important areas in themselves, irrespective of considerations relating to European integration.   THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION  That there has been a significant improvement since mid-1995 in Hungary\\'s macroeconomic situation is beyond doubt. Here are a few facts and comments on some of the features of this improvement.   1. The current account deficit reached $3.5 billion in 1993 and almost $4 billion in 1994, i.e. more than 10% of GDP - an obviously unsustainable situation by any standards, but even more so for a country with a high debt ratio. Some of this deficit was covered by direct foreign investment, but the greater part of it was financed by borrowing, as a result of which by the end of 1994 the net external debt had reached 46% of GDP and the exceptionally high level of more than 160% of exports of goods and services and unrequited transfers.   2. I have not yet seen the full 1996 figures, but estimates based on the first eleven months suggest a current account deficit of around (or even less than) $1.5 billion. This looks much more reasonable, not only because it was more than covered by foreign direct investment but also because of what lies behind this improvement. The $2.5 billion drop in the current account deficit between 1994 and 1996 was made possible (a) by a 35% increase in exports, accompanied by a modest increase in imports of about 14%, and (b) by the steady and rapid increase in services income, mainly (but not exclusively) derived from tourism.   3. Since there was also a sizable inflow of foreign direct investment in 1995 and 1996, the country\\'s net external debt dropped from $18.9 billion at end-1994 to about $13.3 billion at end-1996. Net external debt declined to 31.2 expressed as a percentage of GDP, and to 71.6 as a percentage of exports of goods, services and unrequited transfers. I have also noted that by 1996 net interest payments on the external debt had dropped to 6.7 as a percentage of exports of goods and services. The comparable figures were 12% in 1994 and as high as 17% in 1990. It is useful to point out that the sizable decline of the net external debt was made possible by the substantial decline of the public sector deficit from 8.2% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 1996, while at the same time the share of public sector expenditure in GDP declined from 62% to a more bearable 51%. \"Growing out\" of the debt service burden is no longer wishful thinking. It is beginning to become a reality.   4. The fact I find most noteworthy is that the $2.5 billion switch of resources towards external use, amounting to some 7% of GDP, took place without a recession, which is unusual for such a large switch. It was even accompanied by a small increase in GDP. This would not have been possible without the fast growth of exports. The remarkable growth of labour productivity in industry - of close to 60% between 1992 and 1996 - played a major role in this respect. This growth, together with the changing composition of exports, suggests that the structural transformation of the Hungarian economy has gone quite far. The growth of net services exports points in the same direction.   5. So much for the bright side of the picture, which is a good thing but should not be overstated.  First, these are improvements in comparison with the unsustainable imbalances which characterised both the situation prevailing in 1988-89 and that of the years 1993-94.  Second, the price paid by the majority of Hungarians was very heavy indeed: a drop in net real earnings of 12% in 1995, followed by another of 4% last year. Even if this was arguably unavoidable, given the size of the imbalances which had to be corrected (and which themselves had been caused, to some extent at least, by the premature rise in real earnings in 1994), the size of the sacrifices remains a fact. Against this background, any further erosion of average living standards would be just as unsustainable as were the macroeconomic imbalances in 1993-94.  Third, the rate of inflation is still far too high. Admittedly, since the post-devaluation peak reached in the late spring of 1995 - of more than 30% - the rate has been declining steadily, to stand by December last year at a shade below 20%. But I am seriously worried by the fact that the Hungarian rate of inflation, while never moving towards three digits, has remained stuck within the 18-35% range over the past seven years. The worst was avoided by maintaining positive real interest rates during the greater part of this period, but the distorting effects of such inflation rates on the economy remain substantial, not to mention their socially unacceptable impact on those people whose earnings cannot be adjusted to inflation.   6. Looking ahead, I hope that you will bear with me if I become a little philosophical. All knowledgeable observers of Hungarian history, ancient as well as contemporary, agree that Hungarians possess the very rare ability to pull back at the last minute from the brink of disaster or at least to extricate themselves from a seemingly hopeless situation. They unfortunately also note that once the Hungarians have done so, they miss the opportunity offered by their own success to carry out policies with a long-term perspective in mind. I do hope that history will not repeat itself.  Admittedly, any further decline in the average living standard would be unacceptable. The standard of living should be allowed to begin to rise - but only to the extent that this does not upset the basic balance of the economy again. At the same time, the reduction in inflation must continue at a pace which puts the attainment of single-digit inflation in sight. You must break out - downwards - of the 18 to 35% range. And, last but not least, the country will have to begin to tackle earnestly the major structural problems related to the pension, health care, education and social security systems. These are daunting challenges. Two reminders may help when tackling them. The first is that Hungary has managed major breakthroughs in the recent past which were just as difficult as these future challenges: over the past five years, real privatisation accompanied by a fundamental shift in the structure of industry and services; and, more recently, the handling of a macroeconomic crisis situation. The second is that most of these challenges are akin to those encountered by modern Western societies. For these challenges Hungary is in good company.   THE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENT  Two recent changes have occurred regarding the institutional environment in which the National Bank of Hungary is operating. I welcome both of them.   1. The possibility of the direct financing of the budget deficit by the NBH has been eliminated. This is in conformity with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, and is a measure which has already been implemented by all fifteen member countries of the European Union and which the EMI closely monitors. To remind you, this provision of the Treaty applies to the member countries at this stage, prior to effectively entering EMU. It would seem to me impossible for Hungary to join the European Union without this change in the law governing the operations of the NBH, even if Hungary\\'s participation in the euro area were to come at a later stage.  But this is only an institutional or political argument. There is more to it. Maastricht or no Maastricht, eliminating the direct monetary financing of budget deficits is simply economic common sense. In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon: it cannot happen without an (at least) accommodating expansion of the money supply. And we know from historical experience that more often than not the major source of any such inflationary increase in the money supply has been the direct financing of government by the central bank. Hungary has not been an exception to this general rule - rather its confirmation. And once inflation is established, interest rates go up. Except for very short periods, it is impossible to keep market interest rates below the rate of inflation: who would be ready to undertake financial savings the remuneration of which would imply a loss in real financial wealth? To try to keep interest rates low by monetary financing of the government is a self-defeating device. It may work for a few months, but would end up producing more inflation and higher, not lower, interest rates - certainly higher nominal interest rates, but very likely also higher real rates. The simple reason for this is that people are not fools - at least not for a long time. Monetary financing of the government is therefore likely to combine two evils at the same time: inflation and high interest rates.   2. The accumulated and potential future losses of the NBH on account of its borrowings in foreign currency have been taken over by the government. This is a salutary cleaning-up operation which ought to have been carried out long ago. It has no consequences for the \"real\" economy. These borrowings have been undertaken in the past on government instruction and with government approval, with the NBH acting solely as an intermediary. The NBH\\'s only shareholder is the Hungarian State; the real burden of the State\\'s direct or indirect external borrowing has to be borne by the present or future taxpayers. This real burden was to some extent hidden by the \"seigniorage\" profits of the NBH, which had two consequences: they hid the size of this burden from public view; and they distorted the NBH\\'s accounts. As all experts know, the size of this double distortion was proportional to the rate of inflation, and was aggravated by the NBH\\'s sterilisation policy of large capital inflows, without which, however, inflation would not have been brought down from 30 to 20% within the past eighteen months. Sterilisation was therefore a wise policy; the real culprit is the rate of inflation, which is much higher in Hungary than in the countries whose currencies were used for borrowing. In a sentence: this long overdue measure serves both public transparency and democratic accountability (of both the government and the NBH) - even if the general public, or politicians, may be excused for not fully understanding the intricate interconnection between accounting procedures in a country with high inflation and the processes of the real economy. This is a good example of the generalised mess created by inflation.   CHALLENGES FOR THE HUNGARIAN BANKS  As I said right at the outset, it is now time to look ahead and begin to address some major issues for the Hungarian banks - issues which, thanks to the progress made over the past few years, are no longer totally dissimilar from those facing banks in western Europe. I intend to make a few comments on these, since they are issues on which I can possibly throw some light on the basis of my own professional experience.   1. The first is about the specificity of banking, i.e. about the possibility or desirability of clearly distinguishing banks, through rules and regulations, from other financial intermediaries. I noted that the recent changes in Hungarian banking law have implied a movement towards the de-specialisation of banks, notably in the field of securities transactions. I believe that a development towards the universal banking model is justified - on certain conditions. It is justified for two groups of reasons.  First, because financial innovation in general, and securitisation in particular, are breaking down the traditionally neat distinction between banks and other financial intermediaries, indeed even between financial intermediation and financial markets, all over the world. Some time ago, banks were defined as financial intermediaries whose liabilities (mainly sight and short-term deposits) were equivalent to the money supply, and the money supply was defined as the total sum of bank liabilities. This nice circular definition kept academics, bank regulators and central bankers equally happy until the moment when financial innovation started blurring the distinction between money and other financial assets, and securitisation began blurring the distinction between financial intermediation and financial market operations. The proliferation of derivatives, financial futures and the like added to the confusion between balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The result is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify banking on the basis of the old equivalence of \"banking liabilities = money supply\". This has now been recognised in the sweeping deregulation of banking activities affecting the whole of western Europe and, though more cautiously, also the United States. In some cases this has gone so far as to allow the emergence of consolidated banking and insurance activities.  Second, in a shorter Hungarian perspective, banks in Hungary have a head start on other financial intermediaries in collecting the financial savings of households and of the enterprise sector. Admittedly, Hungary badly needs the large-scale development of life assurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and the like, i.e. all those institutional investors which can channel savings towards equity investment. But this takes time, since experience and human resources are rare and the reform of the pension system and of health services takes time. Banks should be allowed to fill the gap for the time being, by putting at the disposal of savers a wide variety of financial instruments.   2. Now let me come to the risks that a generalised move towards universal banking could entail, and the ways and means of containing them.  The main risk, of course, is the emergence of conflicts of interest. One such potential conflict of interest may arise within any bank, between the bank\\'s own risk-taking activity and risk-taking for its customers. The classic example of this is the potential conflict of interest between credit-granting and securities underwriting, but this is only one example. The traditional way of avoiding the misuse of such conflict-creating situations is (a) to devise an organisational structure with clearly distinguishable lines of responsibility, (b) to avoid flows of \"inside\" information between the various activities, (c) to attribute to each activity costs, income and profits, and (d) to entrust external auditors with the surveillance of the systems put in place. The end-result will, of course, never be entirely safe. Moreover, the building of \"Chinese walls\" inside a multi-polar banking organisation may weaken, or even destroy, the synergy between those poles, i.e. it may undermine the rationale of a multi-polar organisation. I would not want, however, to overstate the internal conflict of interest argument. In the long run, the kind of conflict to which I have referred is unlikely to be very strong. In a longer-term perspective, no bank can afford to favour its own risk-taking activity at the expense of its customers - especially if auditing makes it certain that any misuse of the bank\\'s powers would come to light.   3. Another much more dangerous conflict of interest could arise where the bank is capable of exercising a decisive shareholding power in another non-banking firm, of which it is at the same time a major creditor. This could have unacceptable consequences not only for the firm\\'s other shareholders but, if the practice became widespread, could even lead to structural distortions for entire industries. To avoid this happening, I would favour rather strict regulations. For instance, mutual funds managed by banks should either have limits on the equity participation in individual firms or not have access to the firm\\'s Board. The same should apply, a fortiori, to any bank\\'s direct and permanent equity participation in a non-banking firm - unless, perhaps, the bank remains just a shareholder (as if it were, say, a pension fund), without direct banking operations with the firm in question.   4. Under the last point, I already touched on one particular aspect of corporate governance, namely when a bank can play a decisive role in a non-banking firm\\'s life. But you will also have to face up to the reverse problem: when a non-banking firm becomes a bank\\'s key shareholder and could therefore potentially induce risk-taking by the bank in its favour, at the expense of the bank\\'s other shareholders or of its depositors or customers. This is a particularly acute danger in countries where there are not many non-bank institutional shareholders, where the defence of minority shareholders has no tradition and where depositors are not properly protected. Such problems have been encountered in Western market economies. It is clearly in Hungary\\'s interest to build up, or consolidate, the appropriate defences against the emergence of such problems.   5. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I am not launching any appeal in favour of overregulation. In a market economy, the best regulator is the market itself. And when spontaneous market regulation fails - which does happen - the second-best solution is to use regulatory techniques which favour the emergence of market-led self-regulation. I am simply trying to make two points. First, that banking and finance have broader and more general implications for the economy as a whole than any other kind of activity. A crisis in, say, the steel industry creates hardship, but it does not create a general crisis. A banking crisis may well do so. Second, banking and finance are evolving at a very fast pace under the combined influence of technological progress, innovation and globalisation. This needs a careful adjustment of the regulatory framework, not its general weakening.   6. In a very different area, may I call your attention to the need to develop both retail banking in the narrow sense of the term and also banking services to the dynamic sector of small and medium-sized enterprises. In these fields, Hungarian banking is vastly underdeveloped, both in the number of consumer-friendly local offices and, even more importantly, in the range of high-quality banking services offered to these two groups of customers. This underdevelopment is particularly striking when it is compared with the sophistication of some of the wholesale banking activities being offered.  This is most regrettable and goes against the long-term interests of the banks themselves, not to mention those of the country. Households are, and will remain, the major source of the country\\'s financial savings. They deserve to be supplied with appropriate, safe and diversified vehicles which allow them to find an outlet for their financial wealth. Some small and medium-sized firms are net savers; others desperately need financing for development purposes, which financial markets will not be able to provide for a very long time indeed. I have known of a number of western European and even North American banks which derived great strength from their solid retail banking basis, which helped them considerably in situations in which some, if not many, of their cherished wholesale customers went bust.  You will also need the retail banking basis for another reason. Satisfied household and small enterprise customers provide you with the greatest public support. And I can assure you that you will need this support in a democratic society. Banking has never been, and is unlikely to become, a popular activity, especially when it relies exclusively on customers recruited from among large corporations and very wealthy individuals. Beware of the danger of political backlash.  In developing your retail activities, you will have to monitor western European experiences carefully. Many western European countries are overbanked in this field, and a good deal of discussion is focusing on the merits of customer proximity versus home-computer banking. My feeling is that you will be able to avoid some of the earlier western European excesses, and rely directly on the most recent communications and information systems technology. But for a long time to come, most of your customers will need close human proximity. The comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of these two approaches will be a very great challenge for the Hungarian banking system.  I hope that in ten years\\' time, if I am still around, I shall be able to congratulate you on having been able to successfully meet this challenge. Meanwhile, I wish you good luck - and the ability to help the emergence of good luck by hard work, skilful management and good strategic choices.   ']\n"

      "['2024-03-14', 'Isabel Schnabel', 'The Eurosystem’s operational framework', 'Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting', \"  SPEECH  The Eurosystem’s operational framework   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.

However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.

(2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.

       " \"  SPEECH  The Eurosystem’s operational framework   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.

(2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.     This refers to BrokerTec/MTS one-day repo transactions and EurexGC pooling trades.      \"]"

       "\"  SPEECH  The Eurosystem’s operational framework   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Money Market Contact Group meeting Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle.

ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J.

The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.

This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.     See, for example, Ahnert, T., Anand, K., Gai, P. and Chapman, J. (2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.     This refers to BrokerTec/MTS one-day repo transactions and EurexGC pooling trades.      \""

       "\"g Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2024 Since 2015, the Eurosystem has been operating under a de facto supply-driven floor system. This was the result of the monetary policy actions taken in the run-up to and during the pandemic to preserve price stability in the euro area.  Faced with years of persistently low inflation and the greatest economic contraction on record in 2020, we conducted large-scale asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), thereby injecting a significant amount of central bank reserves into the financial system. The resulting easing of financing conditions supported economic activity in the pursuit of our mandate. As reserves were well in excess of banks’ liquidity needs, short-term money market rates have been trading in the vicinity of the rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates overnight deposits – the deposit facility rate, or DFR. More recently, the volume of reserves has started to visibly decline because of the sharp reversal in the course of monetary policy that was necessary to fight the post-pandemic surge in inflation.  As banks have started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, and as some of the bonds held by the Eurosystem have matured without being reinvested, excess liquidity has fallen by about €1.2 trillion from a peak of nearly €4.7 trillion in mid-2022. By the end of 2025, it is expected to decline by another €1.4 trillion to around €2.1 trillion (Slide 2).  While aggregate excess liquidity would still be abundant at that point, potential structural changes to reserve demand, arising for instance from prudential regulation, imply that there is significant uncertainty about when, and to what extent, the fall in reserves may put upward pressure on overnight money market rates, which could potentially affect the monetary policy stance (Slide 3). Against this background, over the past 15 months the Governing Council has taken stock of the experience gained in implementing monetary policy in different liquidity regimes and has evaluated options that would safeguard the smooth implementation of monetary policy as reserves become less ample.[1]  In my remarks today, I would like to explain the outcome of our deliberations and describe the key characteristics of the Eurosystem’s operational framework.[2] This framework has been tailored to the distinctive features of the euro area economy and will help financial markets and banks adapt to the ongoing changes in the liquidity environment. Taking stock of 25 years of policy implementation Monetary policy implementation has undergone significant shifts since the euro was introduced 25\\xa0years ago.  Until the global financial crisis in 2008, reserves in the euro area were scarce, meaning that banks had to systematically use the regular refinancing operations to cover their liquidity needs arising from the demand for banknotes, the minimum reserve requirements and idiosyncratic liquidity shocks (Slide 4).[3]  By providing the reserves needed to plug the liquidity deficit, the Eurosystem was able to steer the unsecured overnight interest rate to the middle of the corridor that is spanned by the ECB’s three key policy rates: the DFR, the rate at which banks can borrow in the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the rate applied at the marginal lending facility (MLF) (Slide 5). Before 2008, such a corridor system was widespread among central banks. The main difference was how reserves were supplied – either through collateralised lending operations or through asset purchases – and the extent to which volatility in the overnight rate was tolerated.  The ECB, for example, accepted deviations of the overnight rate from the policy target that were, on average, larger than those of the Federal Reserve System or the Bank of Japan but smaller than those of the Bank of England or Sveriges Riksbank (Slide 6, left-hand chart).[4] This was partly a reflection of the relatively large size of the corridor (Slide 6, right-hand chart).[5]  A certain tolerance for volatility – to the extent that it would not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance – reflected the desire by policymakers to promote interbank market activity and keep the central bank balance sheet as lean as possible.[6] Empirical evidence suggests that this volatility generally did not impede the transmission of monetary policy (Slide 7).[7]  The global financial crisis, however, exposed vulnerabilities of the pre-2008 corridor framework.  In particular, a system of scarce liquidity requires a functioning money market to distribute liquidity across the banking system. As the global financial crisis unfolded in August 2007 and banks hoarded reserves, parts of the euro area money market froze and interbank funding costs soared (Slide 8, left-hand chart).  The ECB’s response to these tensions lastingly changed the way monetary policy was implemented in the euro area. Since 2008, all lending operations have been conducted using a fixed-rate full allotment tender procedure against a broad, albeit varying, set of collateral. With full allotment, liquidity in the system was no longer determined by the ECB alone but also by banks, which affected the ECB’s ability to steer money market rates.  For example, when the ECB launched the three-year longer-term refinancing operations in 2011 and 2012 in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, excess liquidity rose considerably, pushing money market rates from levels close to the rate on the MROs down to the DFR (Slide 8, right-hand chart).  At that point, the size of the corridor implied a decline in short-term money market rates of about 70\\xa0basis points, equivalent to almost three “standard” policy cuts.  In 2015, the ECB started purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme (APP). As these purchases created new central bank reserves, excess liquidity quickly rose to levels that were sufficiently large to keep money market rates closely anchored around the DFR. The experience of implementing monetary policy in an environment of abundant liquidity also revealed some of the downsides of that system. One was that the floor was “leaky”. As excess liquidity rose to unprecedented levels following the launch of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in 2020, the spread between the DFR and the euro short-term rate (€STR) steadily widened over the course of 2021 and 2022 (Slide 9, left-hand side). This episode highlighted that, without more fundamental changes to the counterparty framework, a supply-driven floor system was not fully robust either to changes in the liquidity environment and did not provide perfect rate controllability, even if the movements in €STR were gradual and orderly.[8]    A second aspect was that the provision of ample reserves discouraged banks from seeking market-based funding solutions. For example, many banks used the TLTROs to reduce their borrowing in the market, causing a decline in the issuance of commercial paper, secured or unsecured bank bonds and other liabilities (Slide 9, right-hand side).[9]  While funding substitution was in part intended to stimulate loan growth, it implied that banks had fewer occasions to “test” their credit quality in markets, which could run counter to supervisory expectations.[10]  A third concern is the impact of abundant liquidity on market functioning. The Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets increased considerably over the past decade before reaching a turning point in 2022 (Slide 10).  As providing reserves through asset purchases reduces the free float of safe assets, liquidity may dry up in some segments of the financial market and collateral may become scarce. These effects became particularly concerning in 2022, when a significant share of repo transactions using German government bonds as collateral traded more than 40 basis points below €STR, reflecting a shortage of safe assets (Slide 11). Such asset scarcity can delay the transmission of monetary policy.[11] For example, it took more than a week for the policy decisions taken in July, September and October 2022 to be fully reflected in the different segments of the repo market (Slide 12).[12]  The operational framework: principles and characteristics The changes to our operational framework build on the experiences we have gained with implementing monetary policy over the past 25 years. This experience has culminated in six principles, some of which are directly founded on Treaty provisions, that will guide monetary policy implementation in the future:[13]    Effectiveness ensures that the operational framework is able to implement the monetary policy stance in line with the provisions of the EU Treaty;   robustness allows us to implement monetary policy in different financial and liquidity environments;   flexibility implies an elastic supply of central bank reserves based on banks’ needs, effectively channelling liquidity across the entire euro area banking system;   efficiency means that the operational framework implements the desired monetary policy stance and does not interfere with it, while respecting the proportionality principle and taking into account net side effects, including financial stability risks;  the design of the operational framework should also foster the smooth and orderly functioning of markets, consistent with the open market economy principle; finally, the operational framework shall facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the European Union – in particular the transition to a green economy – without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability.  Based on these principles, the framework is designed as a hybrid system that provides reserves elastically and through a mix of instruments, including both short-term lending operations and structural operations. It allows for an effective control of short-term money market rates, while leaving room for learning in an uncertain environment and respecting the established principles and the current starting point characterised by abundant liquidity. Our operational framework has three key characteristics. Refinancing operations are at the centre of liquidity provision  The first is its demand-driven nature. In such a system, the marginal unit of reserves is provided on demand through our regular refinancing operations. To this end, we will continue to provide as much liquidity as banks demand at a fixed rate in the MROs and in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations against broad collateral. Providing liquidity through fixed-rate tenders with full allotment marks a significant change from the balanced liquidity regime operated until 2008. It reflects changes in banks’ liquidity preferences and in the way they operate today.  Years of crises, new regulatory requirements and the advance of new technologies – some of which increase the risk of “digital” bank runs – imply that banks may wish to hold larger liquidity buffers than before 2008.[14]  As central banks injected huge volumes of reserves through large-scale asset purchases, reserves have become an important store of value in the economy, shielded from interest rate and liquidity risks.[15]  Supplying central bank reserves elastically as balance sheet normalisation proceeds will go a long way towards allowing banks to hold the level of reserves that they find optimal, and will help insure against the risks of fragmentation and sudden liquidity imbalances as reserves become less ample. A framework in which the marginal unit of reserves is provided through refinancing operations is best suited for the euro area economy, which remains, despite the gradual rise in market-based finance, a bank-based financial system. Given the effective pass-through of our monetary policy, the Governing Council currently sees no need to grant non-banks access to the Eurosystem balance sheet.[16]  With banks at the core of monetary policy transmission, and with the euro area banking sector being large and heterogeneous, reserves are most effectively supplied, at the margin, through our regular refinancing operations and against a broad set of collateral.  Putting our refinancing operations at the centre of liquidity provision ensures that liquidity reaches all corners of the euro area. By contrast, liquidity provided through asset purchases has tended to be concentrated among a small number of larger financial institutions, which are predominantly located in a few member countries.  Specifically, about 40% of banks, in terms of total assets, are holding the entire excess liquidity from asset purchases, the highest share being held in Germany (Slide 13). Lending operations tend to lead to a more even distribution of reserves across banks and countries.[17]  A system in which reserves are supplied elastically, if calibrated appropriately, is effective in implementing the monetary policy stance, as it does not require the central bank to estimate the uncertain volume of reserves necessary to steer short-term money market rates towards the key policy rate.  In a supply-driven framework, where the system is forced into a liquidity surplus by supplying sufficient reserves, this uncertainty requires a meaningful buffer of reserves to contain the risks of unwarranted volatility.  While a structurally higher supply of liquidity may be stabilising in the short run, it could pose longer-term risks to financial stability by distorting market prices and inducing excessive risk-taking. It would also raise more fundamental concerns about monetary and fiscal interactions in a currency union with sovereign member countries.[18]  So, while a supply-driven system can be the outcome of monetary policy actions to preserve price stability in the vicinity of the effective lower bound, as has been the case since 2015, it is less suitable as a permanent operational framework in the euro area. A demand-driven system, by contrast, can ensure effectiveness and efficiency by limiting net side effects, reducing both the Eurosystem’s footprint in financial markets and the financial risks it faces.  A broad mix of instruments ensures operational robustness The second key characteristic of our framework is the mix of instruments used to supply reserves. A demand-driven system cannot entirely rely on short-term lending operations to satisfy banks’ reserve demand. Banks having to roll over large structural liquidity needs on a weekly basis would increase operational risks. Banknotes in circulation, for example, currently amount to more than €1.5 trillion, nearly five times as much as at the start of monetary union. Moreover, relying exclusively on lending operations would encumber a large share of banks’ assets as collateral, raising bank fragility as fewer unencumbered assets are available to meet creditors’ demands in times of stress.[19]  As such, at a later stage, we will complement our short-term lending operations with new longer-term lending operations and a new structural bond portfolio. Both of these will provide a more stable source of liquidity. At present, the liquidity absorption through autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements is more than offset by the liquidity previously provided through the Eurosystem legacy bond holdings from the APP and the PEPP, and through other financial assets held by national central banks.  But as the run-down of the APP and the PEPP portfolios proceeds, banks will increasingly need to borrow reserves from the Eurosystem, which will show up in a rise in the liquidity demanded at our regular operations (Slide 14). Once the Eurosystem balance sheet begins to grow durably again, we will start supplying reserves through new longer-term refinancing operations and through the new structural bond portfolio, taking into account legacy bond holdings.  Over time, these structural operations will make a substantial contribution to covering the banking sector’s structural liquidity needs arising from autonomous factors and minimum reserve requirements. In the period ahead, ECB staff will conduct an in-depth analysis of how to design these new instruments in accordance with the established principles.  The size and composition of the new portfolio, as well as the pricing and duration of longer-term refinancing operations will be chosen so as to minimise their impact on the monetary policy stance, market functioning and moral hazard, and to facilitate the ECB’s pursuit of its secondary objective by incorporating considerations related to climate change. “Soft” floor with narrow spread limits volatility and incentivises market activity The third key characteristic of the framework is that monetary policy is implemented through a “soft” floor with a narrow spread.   The Governing Council will continue to steer the monetary policy stance through the DFR, which has acted as the de facto anchor for money market rates in recent years. Current large excess liquidity levels imply that short-term interest rates can be expected to continue to trade in a narrow range around the DFR for some time. As reserves become less ample, however, money market rates could rise relative to the DFR and potentially become more volatile. In view of this, the rate on the MROs and the rate at the MLF will be adjusted such that the spread between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will be reduced to 15 basis points from 50 basis points currently, and the spread between the MLF rate and the rate on the MROs remains unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points. The corresponding adjustments of the MRO und MLF rates will come into effect with the sixth maintenance period of 2024, which begins on 18 September. The relatively narrow spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR will limit the potential upward pressure on money market rates and set incentives for banks to borrow liquidity in our operations as our balance sheet normalises.  Moreover, by leaving the spread between the MLF rate and the MRO rate unchanged at 25\\xa0basis points, our framework imposes a higher cost on banks running into a reserve shortage between our weekly refinancing operations, thereby generating conditions in which banks, on aggregate, may wish to hold excess liquidity, especially in the presence of a broad collateral framework. The parameterisation of our framework therefore implies that short-term money market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the DFR. A “soft” floor means that the Governing Council will tolerate deviations from the DFR, provided such movements do not blur the signal about the intended monetary policy stance. In other words, orderly deviations in both directions are accepted. However, excessive volatility that would interfere with the monetary policy stance, or a persistent drift of money market rates away from the DFR, could require the framework parameters to be reviewed.  The chosen set of parameters reflects the trade-off central banks face between limiting volatility and setting incentives for banks to insure themselves against liquidity shocks in financial markets. This trade-off depends on the cost of carry, which is the spread between the rate banks pay for borrowing reserves and the remuneration they receive when depositing these reserves back with the central bank.  The lower this cost, the greater the incentive for banks to obtain liquidity primarily through the central bank.[20] But as we have observed in the past, discouraging banks from seeking market-based funding solutions may be undesirable as it risks weakening the resilience of the banking system and may go against the principle of an open market economy. These risks are especially high when banks have access to longer-term refinancing operations and are permitted to pledge non-marketable assets as collateral, as our framework foresees.  Since excess reserves count towards the fulfilment of prudential liquidity ratios, the combination of a very low cost of carry and a broad collateral framework could encourage banks to engage in excessive liquidity transformation, as they receive Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by pledging non-HQLA as collateral.  Such liquidity transformation remains economically attractive even after haircuts are taken into account.[21] In the first half of 2023, before banks began repaying their TLTRO loans, non-HQLA accounted for about 80% of mobilised collateral with the Eurosystem. A higher cost of carry reduces incentives for excessive liquidity transformation and thereby promotes both a leaner central bank balance sheet and the objectives of prudential regulation of banks having a diversified funding structure. At the same time, a high cost of carry increases the potential for rate volatility in money markets. A system with fixed-rate full allotment means that, as the balance sheet normalises, aggregate liquidity conditions, and hence money market rates, may fluctuate to a degree that could affect the transmission of monetary policy. In the view of the Governing Council, a spread of 15 basis points between the rate on the MROs and the DFR manages this trade-off well. It is small enough to contain volatility but large enough to preserve incentives for money market activity by encouraging banks to manage their liquidity prudently, thereby avoiding the risk of excessive liquidity transformation.[22]  Recent evidence indeed suggests that money market activity may be revived as excess liquidity is withdrawn. With interest rates moving back into positive territory and banks having started repaying their outstanding TLTRO loans, we have observed incipient signs of a moderate recovery in money market activity, including in interbank trading and across borders (Slide 15).  Similarly, while cash-motivated transactions accounted for just 14% of repo transactions in 2022, the volume of these transactions increased visibly as excess liquidity started to decline (Slide 16).[23] It remains to be seen whether the chosen spread is sufficient to meaningfully revive money market activity. A spread of 15 basis points is also likely to be conducive to supporting both a financially sound Eurosystem balance sheet and financial stability.  If the cost of carry were too high, banks might shy away and unduly economise on their holdings of reserves, leaving them more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As our regular refinancing operations are intended to play a central role in meeting banks’ liquidity needs, the pricing should ensure that counterparties use them as an integral part of a smooth monetary policy implementation.  If, however, the spread were too narrow, there would be a risk that banks might hoard reserves, turning the central bank into a lender of first resort, thereby reducing banks’ incentives to insure themselves against short-term liquidity risks in financial markets.  Overall, therefore, the configuration of our framework supports financial stability by allowing banks to replace reserves that will be absorbed through the run-down of our monetary policy assets in our refinancing operations at a cost that neither encourages banks to overly hoard nor to shun central bank reserves. That said, the transition from a situation of abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity has few precedents and there is a lot of uncertainty about how market participants are going to adjust their behaviour.  Therefore, in the period ahead, we will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money market rates, the evolution of banks’ demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets and financial markets more broadly.  Based on the experience we gain, the Governing Council will review the key parameters of the operational framework in 2026 and stands ready to adjust the design and parameters of the framework at an earlier stage, if necessary, to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy remains in line with the established principles.  Conclusion Let me conclude. The Governing Council yesterday set out how we intend to steer short-term interest rates in the future, based on six principles, some of which are directly founded on the EU Treaty. The changes to the operational framework balance the benefits of providing central bank reserves elastically upon demand with the costs associated with a balance sheet that is larger than is strictly necessary to effectively implement the monetary policy stance. The changes to our operational framework do not have any implications for our monetary policy stance, neither for our interest rate policy nor for our monetary policy bond portfolios, which we expect to continue to be run off. With excess liquidity declining, clarity on the framework will help banks prepare for a period where holding central bank reserves will no longer be costless. At the same time, our decision to reduce the rate banks pay on the MROs and the MLF from 18 September 2024 onwards will ensure that interest rate volatility will be contained as balance sheet normalisation proceeds, and that counterparties use MROs as an integral part of a smooth implementation of monetary policy. Taken together, the key characteristics of our operational framework will ensure that it remains effective and efficient, flexible and robust, and that it supports our secondary objective, while respecting the open market economy principle. Thank you.      See also Schnabel, I. (2023), “Back to normal? Balance sheet size and interest rate control”, speech at an event organised by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisors, New York, 27 March.     ECB (2024), ECB announces changes to the operational framework for implementing monetary policy, 13 March.     Our regular open market operations consist of one-week liquidity-providing operations (the main refinancing operations) and three-month liquidity-providing operations.     Between 1999 and 2006, the standard deviation of the spread between the EONIA and the rate on the MROs averaged 15 basis points, with frequent spikes of larger magnitude.     From April 1999 onwards, the corridor width was 200 basis points in the euro area. By comparison, the Bank of Canada and the Sveriges Riksbank implemented monetary policy with a corridor of 50 and 150 basis points, respectively.     Bindseil, U. and Jabłecki, J. (2011), “The optimal width of the central bank standing facilities corridor and banks’ day-to-day liquidity management”, Working Paper Series, No 1350, ECB, June; Allen, W.A. (2002), “Bank of England open market operations: the introduction of a deposit facility for counterparties”, BIS Papers, No 12, Bank for International Settlements; Mitlid, K. and Vesterlund, M. (2001), “Steering interest rates in monetary policy – how does it work?”, Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review, No 1, pp. 19-41; Tucker, P. (2004), “Managing the central bank’s balance sheet: where monetary policy meets financial stability”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Vol. 44, No 3, Bank of England; and Bank of Canada (1995), “A proposed framework for the implementation of monetary policy in the Large Value Transfer System environment”, Discussion Paper.     See ECB (2007), “Volatility of the overnight interest rate and its transmission along the money market yield curve”, Monthly Bulletin, August; and ECB (2005), “The transmission of overnight interest rate volatility to longer-term interest rates in the euro area money market”, Monthly Bulletin, August. The ECB adjusted its framework in March 2004. The timing of reserve maintenance periods was amended and the maturity of the MROs was shortened from two weeks to one week. The main reason behind these changes were the underbidding episodes that had occurred in periods when there were expectations of an interest rate reduction.     A “leaky” floor is mostly a reflection of segmentation: as only banks have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they can charge non-banks a fee for providing liquidity services. Granting non-banks access to the deposit facility could thus help establish a “hard” floor but would come with other challenges, as these institutions are less regulated than banks.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), “TLTRO III and bank lending conditions”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB; and Andreeva, D. and García-Posada, M. (2021), “The impact of the ECB's targeted long-term refinancing operations on banks’ lending policies: The role of competition”, Journal of Banking & Finance, Vol. 122.      This includes Pillar 3 “market discipline” requirements under the Basel III rules.     Schnabel, I. (2023), “Quantitative tightening: rationale and market impact”, speech at the Money Market Contact Group meeting,Frankfurt am Main, 2 March.     This may also have reflected uncertainties regarding the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits at the time.     ECB (2024, op.cit.).     The events that unfolded in the United States in March 2023 suggest that the risks of bank runs have measurably increased in the digital age where information travels much faster.     See also Borio, C., Disyatat, P. and Schrimpf, A. (2024), “The double-faced demand for bank reserves and its implications”, VoxEU, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 15 February.     However, even without direct access to our balance sheet, the experience so far suggests that, in times of crisis, our toolkit has been able to provide liquidity – either directly or indirectly – to all parts of the financial system, including non-banks.     In the past, while in absolute terms more liquidity has been provided through asset purchases, the liquidity provided through credit operations reached 60% of the euro area banking system directly compared with 43% through asset purchases. Even after redistribution, liquidity generated via asset purchases remains largely concentrated among investment banks, custodians and clearing institutions in euro area financial centres.     Evidence from the United States suggests that financial stability risks may be significant under a supply-driven system, as banks may use reserves to build up significant runnable short-term liabilities. Such “liquidity dependence” may lead to a ratcheting up of the balance sheet that could be hard to reverse. See Acharya, V.V., Chauhan, R.S., Rajan, R. and Steffen, S. (2023), “Liquidity Dependence and the Waxing and Waning of Central Bank Balance Sheets”, NBER Working Papers, No 31050, National Bureau of Economic Research; Acharya, V. and Rajan, R. (2022), “Liquidity, liquidity everywhere, not a drop to use – Why flooding banks with central bank reserves may not expand liquidity”, NBER Working Papers, No 29680, National Bureau of Economic Research.     See, for example, Ahnert, T., Anand, K., Gai, P. and Chapman, J. (2019), “Asset Encumbrance, Bank Funding, and Fragility”, The Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 32, Issue 6, pp. 2422-2455, 22 September.     The cost of carry also determines banks’ demand for other HQLA, implying that a framework that incentivises banks to hoard central bank reserves risks being less neutral with respect to market prices.     Barbiero, F., Boucinha, M. and Burlon, L. (2021), op. cit.; and Andreeva, D.C. and García-Posada, M. (2021), op. cit. The experience of the first two TLTRO programmes allotted between September 2014 and March 2017 suggest that liquidity transformation through a broad collateral framework is quantitatively material: a one standard deviation increase in non-HQLA holdings accounts for 22% of the standard deviation of banks’ take-up over assets. See Sugo, T. and Vergote, O. (2020), “Who takes the ECB’s targeted funding?”, Working Paper Series, No 2439, ECB.     At the Bank of England banks can borrow and deposit reserves at the same rate (i.e. the spread is zero). However, unlike in the euro area, banks in the United Kingdom need to pledge high-quality collateral, which is subject to haircuts that are generally higher than those applied by central counterparties in the market.     This refers to BrokerTec/MTS one-day repo transactions and EurexGC pooling trades.      \""
