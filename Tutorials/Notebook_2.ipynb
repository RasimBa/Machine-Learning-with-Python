    "The following tutorial describes the main elements of linear regressions, regularization techniques and cross-validation by predicting the housing prices in Boston. In order to implement these techniques, the \"Boston Housing Dataset\" is included. The dataset is available from different sources like GitHub, Kaggle and Sklearn. The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.\n",

    "The data contains the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CRIM - per capita crime rate by town\n",
    "    ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "    INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
    "    CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n",
    "    NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n",
    "    RM - average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
    "    AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n",
    "    DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n",
    "    RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways\n",
    "    TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000\n",
    "    PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n",
    "    B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n",
    "    LSTAT - % lower status of the population\n",
    "    MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's\n"
